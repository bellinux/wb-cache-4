5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, Clifton Bridge {{came under the}} aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. Services had reduced by 1949 to 13 trains per day on weekdays and seven on Sundays, and passenger numbers fell. The station became an <b>unstaffed</b> <b>halt</b> from 29 October 1962, and in 1963, the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line. Passenger services at Clifton Bridge were ended on 7 September 1964, with goods services ending the next year on 5 July 1965. In the final year of passenger operation, there were only six trains on weekdays and none on Sundays. One of the carriage sidings had been taken out of service in 1964, and the others followed in 1966. The line through the site was reduced to single track in 1965, and the signal box was closed on 4 November 1966. The station buildings were mostly demolished, and the site became the headquarters of the Avon and Somerset Constabulary Mounted Police and Dog Section. Part of the western platform remained in situ, as did the retaining wall of the eastern platform shelter. The station footbridge became part of a footpath. Freight trains continued to pass through the station, but their number decreased over time, with the line falling out of regular use from 30 March 1981. The route however was kept intact by British Rail, with occasional freight trains, and in 2002 a single track was relaid to allow rail access to Royal Portbury Dock.|$|E

2500|$|The Great Western Railway {{opened the}} station in 1847 as a {{temporary}} terminus of the Berks and Hants Line which started at Reading. In 1862 the Berks and Hants was extended to [...] It eventually reached Taunton on 2 April 1906 to allow the running of express trains from [...] through to the south west without taking the longer route through Bristol. The station ceased to deal with goods traffic in 1970 and became an <b>unstaffed</b> <b>halt</b> with subsequent demolition of the station buildings (except the 1902 footbridge over the lines) in 1971. The footbridge {{was replaced by the}} current modern structure in 1999. A freight train crashed on 10 November 1971 partially demolishing the GWR signal box, which was then replaced by a modern wooden flat roofed signal box which served until the end of semaphore signalling and the introduction of colour light signals on 17 July 1978.|$|E

50|$|The Bletchley - Bedford route, {{now known}} as the Marston Vale Line, survived in a {{downgraded}} form as freight facilities were withdrawn and the stations became <b>unstaffed</b> <b>halts.</b> The station, now a terminus, came under the authority of then area manager at Bedford Midland.

A third attempt to close the line in 1972 was resisted by the Bedford Rail Users' Association.|$|R
50|$|This {{arrangement}} {{continued until}} the Great Central decided there was sufficient {{demand for a}} passenger service between Grimsby and Immingham Dock and village to justify building two <b>unstaffed</b> <b>halts,</b> each with a single 240 ft wooden platform, one at the Immingham end of the GDLR, {{to be known as}} Immingham Halt, and the other at the Grimsby end, to be known as Grimsby Pyewipe Road.

In {{the last few years}} before closure, the line became a long siding providing a skeleton passenger service which was very cheap to run and with no level crossings of any importance. Once staff had been withdrawn, access to the station was via a side gate rather than through the booking hall which was locked out of use. The station closed on 4 May 1970 The goods yard closed on 6 November 1967.and the next day Lowestoft North signal box also closed, the last Norfolk & Suffolk box still in use at the time.|$|R
