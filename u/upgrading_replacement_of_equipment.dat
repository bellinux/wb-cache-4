The present state of industrial energy in India could be characterized by significant technological out-of–date, low energy efficiency and low level of environmental protection. Presented analysis {{of the results of}} conducted energy audits in selected industrial companies in previous period has shown the significant potentials for energy efficiency improvements in industrial sector (<b>upgrading</b> or <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> in the industrial energy sources and processes, introduction of energy management, improvement of steam supply and condensate return systems, the waste heat utilization, introduction of energy efficiency technology, improvement of energy efficiency in electrical <b>equipment,</b> usage <b>of</b> waste materials etc) ...|$|R

50|$|The {{ability to}} design and operate {{manufacturing}} facilities that can quickly and effectively adapt to changing technological and market requirements is becoming increasingly important {{to the success of}} any manufacturing organization. In the face of shorter product life cycles, higher product variety, increasingly unpredictable demand, and shorter delivery times, manufacturing facilities dedicated to a single product line cannot be cost effective any longer. Investment efficiency now requires that manufacturing facilities be able to shift quickly from one product line to another without major retooling, resource reconfiguration, or <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There was {{a gradual}} {{decrease}} in incoming business of capital goods industries (3), {{which resulted in}} the ending of an expansive boom. The initial trouble began in 1956 with a deceleration in business planning for <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> and expansion <b>of</b> manufacturing facilities, resulting in a drop in new orders for equipment (2). This created a widening gap between the supply and the use of industrial capacity (3). Federal Reserve economists believed that the administration had contributed to the recession by cutting back on Department of Defense purchases in 1957 (2).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the issues of}} economic transformation, reconstruction, and technical re-equipment of the energy sector in the Russian Federation. The sector is struggling with economic inefficiency and post-transformation legacy. Energy sector transformation represents {{a key element in}} ensuring the energy security and it one of he most troubling questions of energy economics nowadays. It is expected that by 2020 more than half <b>of</b> the energy <b>equipment</b> in Russia would exceed its economic life. Our results show that the main goals of reconstruction might include life extension, increasing production efficiency, and output. We demonstrate that these goals can be achieved through partial <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> the most worn parts <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> (e. g. <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> blades in the turbine), the combination of new and old equipment (such as add-in steam and gas cycle), and full <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment...</b>|$|R

50|$|When first {{built the}} VVER design was {{intended}} to be operational for 35 years. A mid-life major overhaul including a complete <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> critical parts such as fuel and control rod channels was thought necessary after that. Since RBMK reactors specified a major replacement programme at 35 years designers originally decided this needed to happen in the VVER type as well, although they are of more robust design than the RBMK type. Most of Russia's VVER plants are now reaching and passing the 35 year mark. More recent design studies have allowed for an extension of lifetime up to 50 years with <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment.</b> New VVERs will be nameplated with the extended lifetime.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} present a model <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>replacement</b> in a {{stochastic}} environment utilizing {{a number of the}} component characteristics of an operations research orientation while being designed to emphasize the role of a stochastic representation of technological change and/or maintenance costs and the implications these have for the decision about <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment.</b> The "replacement" referred to here is <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> a machine in its entirety rather than the usual periodic-review-replacement-of-individual-pieces analysis to which the term "replacement" frequently refers in operations research literature. The paper outlines the approaches to equipment replacement in the literature of economics and the well-known Terborgh model and then introduces a stochastic model for studying certain aspects <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>replacement</b> together with the form of its analytic solution. A comparison of the cost implications of the Terborgh and stochastic model is presented for a specific example utilizing motor vehicle data. In addition, a general analytic comparison <b>of</b> the two <b>replacement</b> rules is provided. ...|$|R
50|$|The NRZ {{has also}} {{suffered}} from the general decline of the country's economy. Neglect of maintenance, lacking spare parts and overdue <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> {{have led to a}} situation were only part of the railroad net is in good condition and equipment problems have led to reduced service. Steam locomotives have been reintroduced since 2004 as coal is in relatively good supply, while diesel must be imported and electricity shortages are common. Further, the company is seriously indebted, making it impossible to solve this situation without external help. Goods transport has declined, from 18 million tonnes in 1998 to 2 million tonnes in 2010.|$|R
