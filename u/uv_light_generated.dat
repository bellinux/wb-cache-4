40|$|Compounds that undergo {{reversible}} photochemical transformations {{have been}} investigated for use in optoelectronic technologies, molecular devices {{and to a lesser}} extent, in influencing chemical reactivity. Photoresponsive 1, 2 -dithienylethenes (DTEs) represent a significant improvement over azobenzenes, used in previous research, primarily because they undergo thermally irreversible photochemical ring-closing and ring-opening reactions. The light-induced isomerization between ring-open and ring-closed isomers results in steric, electronic and localized p-bond arrangement changes. This makes DTEs appealing in the design of systems controlling the chemical reactivity of photoresponsive catalysts and reagents. The research presented in this thesis demonstrates control of reactivity using the DTE architecture. The initial approach of modulating reactivity used the flexible-to-rigid changes of the DTE backbone to control the stereochemical outcome of a catalytic reaction. The results showed that only the flexible ring-open form of a bis(oxazoline) DTE ligand, where the metal-binding groups could converge towards each other and chelate copper(I). With this binding geometry, the cyclopropanation reaction of styrene with ethyldiazoacetate afforded stereoselectivity in the product distribution. Irradiation with <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> <b>generated</b> the rigid ring-closed isomer, rendering it ineffective towards metal-chelation by forcing the metal-binding groups to diverge away from one another. In a second study, a DTE bearing bis(phosphine) groups was prepared, representing a new class of photoresponsive ligands with steric and electronic differences between the two photogenerated isomers. It was also shown that DTE-metal complexes remained photochromic, albeit with decreased photoconversion. Results also indicated that the extended conjugation in the ring-closed isomer resulted in greater electron-withdrawing effects on the phosphine compared to the ring-open isomer. In a third study, the localized p-bond rearrangement accompanying the ring-opening/ring-closing isomerization reactions of a DTE were used to activate/deactivate an enediyne towards Bergman cyclization. This was done by installing/removing a localized p-bond shared between an enediyne and the DTE backbone. Only the ring-open isomer contained the enediyne structure required to produce a diradical, which is responsible for the potent antitumor activity of enediyne derivatives. The ring-open isomer was created by irradiating the thermally stable ring-closed isomer with visible light, thus unmasking an enediyne, which could subsequently undergo a Bergman cyclization...|$|E

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScIn South Africa, water {{pollution}} problems {{have continued to}} increase due to increasing anthropogenic activities. The increasing number of organic contaminants in various water sources {{can be attributed to}} industrial development, population growth and agricultural run- off. These activities have impacted negatively on the availability and accessibility to sustainable clean water resources, exposing citizens to water borne diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea and typhoid fever; commonly reported among children. Advanced oxidation technologies such as dielectric barrier electrohydraulic discharge (EHD), also referred to as dielectric barrier discharge (DBD), have the ability to decompose persistent organics and eliminate microbes. DBD offers advantages such as efficiency, energy saving, rapid processing, use of few or no chemicals, and non-destructive impact on the ecosystem. The system is also capable of generating ozone, hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen, superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals and other active species. The combination of these reactive species has been reported to degrade biological and chemical pollutants rapidly and efficiently. In this study, the DBD system was optimized by investigating the effect of physico-chemical, electrical parameters and reactor configurations on Methylene Blue (MB) decolouration efficiency. The physico-chemical parameters included MB concentration, solution pH and conductivity, solution volume, NaCl electrolyte concentration in the electrode compartment and air flow rate. As for electrical parameters, the effects of voltage, electrode type and size on MB decolouration efficiency were studied. The effect of the aforementioned parameters on MB decolouration efficiency was assessed by varying one parameter at a time. The following physico-chemical parameters: time (from 0 - 60 minutes), pH (2. 5 - 10. 5), solution conductivity (5 - 20 mS/cm), MB concentration (0. 5 – 10 mg/L), solution volume (500 – 2000 mL), NaCl electrode electrolyte concentration (10 – 50 g/L) and air flow rate (2 – 4 L/min) were varied in their respective ranges under the applied experimental conditions: reactor air gap 2 mm, solution volume 1500 mL, NaCl electrolyte concentration of 50 g/L in the electrode compartment, voltage 25 V (7. 8 kV), airflow rate 3 L/min, 0. 5 mm silver electrode and a running time of 60 minutes. As for electrical parameters, voltage (from 20 - 25 V), electrode type (copper, silver and stainless steel) and electrode diameter (0. 5 – 1. 5 mm) were also altered individually at the applied experimental conditions. The reactor air gap was varied from 2 to 6 mm. At the same experimental conditions, the free reactive species generated mainly H 2 O 2 and O 3, were detected and quantified using the Eisenberg and indigo methods, respectively. The optimum physico-chemical parameters were found to be MB concentration 5 mg/L, concentration of NaCl electrolyte used in the central compartment of the DBD reactor 50 g/L, solution pH 2. 5, solution conductivity 10 mS/cm, air flow rate 3 L/min, solution volume 1500 mL and an optimum contact time of 30 minutes. The optimum electrical parameters were found to be: applied voltage 25 and 1. 5 mm silver electrode. The following parameters MB concentration, solution conductivity and pH, applied voltage and reactor configuration significantly affected MB decolouration efficiency compared to parameters such as solution volume, the inlet air flow rate, electrode type and size and NaCl electrolyte concentration in the electrode compartment, which were less effective in enhancing MB decolouration. Moreover, for all DBD experiments performed at the applied experimental conditions, complete decolouration of MB was achieved in the first 30 minutes. However, trends between the optimized parameters and MB decolouration efficiency were mostly observed after 10 minutes. The optimized DBD system reduced the treatment time from 30 to 20 minutes without any chemical additives. Moreover, at 5 mg/L MB under the applied optimum conditions, it was proved that besides 99 % of MB decolouration reached after 60 minutes, 53 % of total organic carbon (TOC) removal was also achieved. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) characterizing MB toxicity was less than 5 mg/L before as well as after the DBD experiment. After 10 minutes of experiment under the following conditions: Applied voltage 25 V, MB concentration 5 mg/L, solution pH (in between 6. 04 and 6. 64), solution volume 1500 mL, air flow rate 3 L/min, 0. 5 mm silver electrode and a contact time of 60 minutes, about 3. 73 x 10 - 5 mol/L H 2 O 2 was produced which decreased to 2. 93 x 10 - 5 mol/L 10 minutes later, while O 3 concentration was initially very low and could not be detected. However, 0. 5 mol/L of O 3 was detected after 20 minutes of operating time, thereafter, H 2 O 2 concentration decreased continuously with time while that of O 3 fluctuated as the treatment time increased. Likewise, the energy density for the production of free reactive species reached 0. 87 g/ kWh in the first 10 minutes due to the presence of chromophoric functional groups such as =N+(CH 3) 2 in MB structure that had to be destroyed. Thereafter, the energy consumption decreased progressively to zero with an increase in treatment time due to the destruction of =N+(CH 3) 2 groups in MB structure with time. The correlation between the rise in the of H 2 O 2 concentration and energy density after 10 minutes was probably due to dissociation of OH- OH bonds in H 2 O 2 by UV light to yield OH radicals which unselectively may have attacked MB dye. Thus, MB decomposition in the current DBD reactor was mostly initiated by H 2 O 2 and O 3. The irradiation of H 2 O 2 by <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> <b>generated</b> in the DBD system was found to accelerate dye decomposition in the first 30 minutes of the experiment. The UV-vis analysis of treated MB samples confirmed that the complete decolouration of MB achieved in the first 30 minutes was due to the destruction of the chromophoric [=N+(CH 3) 2] group in Methylene blue structure, while the FT-IR confirmed the presence of traces of various functional groups such as C=C, C=O, C=N, NH, NH 3, NO 2, etc. characteristics of carboxylic acids, amines, amides, nitrogen based compounds (salts), aliphatic and unsaturated by-products remaining in the bulk solution after treatment. The salts analysis after treatment showed that 16 mg/L of nitrates and nitrites and 1. 1 mg/L of sulphates mainly originating from air and MB decomposition were present in the treated samples. The EHD/DBD system used in this study offers an approach to partially treat water/wastewaters and its optimization was able to significantly enhance the decomposition of the target MB dye as indicated by the reduction of total organic carbon (TOC) from 8. 3 mg/L to 3. 9 mg/L.

40|$|The {{photocatalytic}} reforming of oxy-hydrocarbons {{has been}} studied in some detail over Pd-titania systems.

Analysis {{of a variety of}} TiO 2 powders showed that only anatase phase TiO 2 were active in the photoreforming reaction. The activity also showed an inverse relationship with the surface hydroxyl group of TiO 2. By exploring the effect of molecular structure on the rate of hydrogen evolution from a variety of alcohols over Pd/TiO 2 catalysts, a few simple rules are derived that predict the relative rates of photocatalytic reforming and the dominant reaction products. The rate of hydrogen evolution for a range of molecules shows a linear relationship with the stoichiometrically available molecular hydrogen content. For an alcohol CxHyOH, decarbonylation dominates with the formation of CO 2 and a hydrocarbon Cxi- The mechanism involves decomposition of oxygenates on the metal surface producing hydrogen gas and the formation of adsorbed CO. The latter is subsequently oxidized by an oxygen species (O") generated in the semiconductor by <b>UV</b> <b>light.</b> Desorption of the resulting CO 2 enables another alcohol molecule to adsorb, restarting the cycle. Water is reduced at the TiO 2 hole replacing the lost anion and generating further hydrogen. Silicon has been proposed as a potential sensitizer for photocatalysts because its small band gap would allow excitations from wavelengths that are out of reach of semiconductors such as TiO 2. Therefore, the stability of the silicon surface towards air and water in the presence of <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> is an important parameter and it was explored in this study. Silicon nanoparticles suspended in water undergo photo-oxidation when exposed to <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> <b>generating</b> hydrogen gas.

In order to discriminate the precise role of unrepaired CPDs and 6 - 4 PPs in UV-induced responses triggering cell death, human fibroblasts were transduced by recombinant adenoviruses carrying the CPD-photolyase or 6 - 4 PP-photolyase cDNAs. Both photolyases were able to prevent UV-induced apoptosis in cells deficient for nucleotide excision repair (NER) to a similar extent, while in NER-proficient cells UV-induced apoptosis was prevented only by CPD-photolyase, with no effects observed when 6 - 4 PPs were removed by the specific photolyase. These results strongly suggest that both CPDs and 6 - 4 PPs contribute to UV-induced apoptosis in NER-deficient cells, while in NER-proficient cells, CPDs are the only lesions responsible for UV-killing, {{probably due to the}} rapid repair of 6 - 4 PPs by NER. As a consequence, the difference in skin photosensitivity, including carcinogenesis, of most of the xeroderma pigmentosum patients and of normal people is probably not only a quantitative aspect, but depends on the type of DNA damage induced by sunlight and its rate of repair.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the light-induced orientation process of azobenzene-containing polymers caused by irradiation with linearly polarized red light is investigated. This process is surprising because {{there is almost no}} absorption at 633 nm. Depending on the photochemical pre-treatment and the exposure time, the azobenzene moieties can undergo two different orientation processes resulting in either a parallel or a perpendicular orientation with respect to the electric field vector of the incident light. The fast orientation of the photochromic groups with their long axis {{in the direction of the}} light polarization requires a photochemical pre-treatment in which non-polarized <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> <b>generates</b> Z-isomers. Due to this procedure the film becomes 'photochemically activated' for the subsequent polarized irradiation with red light. But on continued exposure a second, much slower reorientation process occurs which establishes an orientation of the azobenzene groups perpendicular to the electric field vector. The fast mechanism is probably caused by an angle-selective photo-isomerization of the Z-isomers to the E-isomers, while the subsequent slow reorientation process is caused by the well-known conventional photo-orientation taking place via the accumulation of a number of photoselection steps and the rotational diffusion minimizing the absorbance of the E-isomer. This process occurs in the steady state but at this wavelength with a very small concentration of Z-isomers. The competing mechanisms take place in the same polymer film under almost identical irradiation conditions, differing only in the actual concentration of the Z-isomers...|$|R

A small amount of the sample containing H 2 O 2 is injected into the acidic flow solution of Fe 2 +, which passes through a tubular PTFE reactor irradiated with <b>UV</b> <b>light.</b> The <b>generated</b> CO 2 is quantified by a conductometric detector and is directly proportional to the dissolved organic carbon concentration in the sample. The optimization studies were performed using EDTA solutions. The average recovery of organic carbon was 83 % with a relative standard deviation of 3. 7 % using a 1 : 5 molar ratio of Fe 2 +:H 2 O 2, pH 2. 0, 100 muL of sample injection and a liquid flow of 1 mL min- 1.

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} {{is to develop a}} photo-switchable dry adhesive. Spiropyran doped PDMS polymer was moulded into {{biomimetic}} mushroom-shaped fibrillar adhesive microstructures characterized using a variety of measurement techniques and compared with a flat control surface made of the same material. Using <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> to <b>generate</b> of charged merocyanine molecules within ‘mushroom’-shaped micro-structured PDMS films enhanced the adhesion of the film to glass surfaces. The strength of the dry adhesive property can be lowered back to the original state using visible light. Quick and efficient switching in the polymer was observed. Integrating this molecule increased normal adhesion of unstructured samples by a factor of ~ 4 when polymer was in the neutral spiropyran form and ~ 5 for the merocyanine zwitterionic isomer, which demonstrated that control over the adhesion strength was possible. Surface charge and contact angle measurements further confirmed the proper functionality of the switch inside the PDMS polymer...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{phosphorylation}} is {{a central}} regulatory mechanism in signal transduction pathways and cellular migration. Current genetic strategies {{for the study of}} phosphorylation, including gene knockout and point mutation, are limited in providing temporal information. As a complement to these techniques, the synthesis and semisynthesis of probes that enable researchers to observe the downstream effects of kinase-mediated phosphorylation in "real time" are presented in this thesis. The release of a physiologically-relevant concentration of a phosphopeptide with temporal and spatial control is accomplished by the photolysis of a photolabile precursor, a caged phosphopeptide. The synthesis and application of NI-Fmoc-protected 1 -(2 -nitrophenyl) ethyl (NPE) caged phosphothreonine, serine, and tyrosine building blocks facilitate the straightforward assembly of any caged phosphopeptide through Fmoc-based solid phase peptide synthesis. Removal of the NPE caging group by irradiation with long-wavelength <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> <b>generates</b> a concentration burst of the corresponding phosphopeptide. In addition, the installation of a caged phosphoamino acid into a full-length, multi-domain protein, the cellular migration protein paxillin, is described. A strategy, which is applicable to any expressible protein target, is detailed for the semisynthesis of a paxillin variant with a caged phosphorylated tyrosine at residue 31 of the 557 -residue protein using native chemical ligation. (cont.) Paxillin is a 61 -kDa protein known to orchestrate the interaction of signaling proteins involved in cell migration by acting as a molecular adaptor, with the creation of specific binding sites dependent on paxillin phosphorylation. Therefore, the semisynthetic probe comprises the entire paxillin macromolecule, including all other binding and localization domains, which are essential for creating a native-like system to probe the effect of phosphorylation. The comprehensive biochemical characterization of the paxillin probe and quantification of uncaging following irradiation with long-wavelength <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> are also described. Additionally, the strategy developed for the paxillin semisynthesis was applied to incorporate a different unnatural amino acid, the fluorescent chemosensing residue Sox, into a protein-domain sensor for ERK 2 kinase activity. The protein domain sensor demonstrated significantly improved sensitivity for ERK 2 phosphorylation over the corresponding peptide probe. by Elizabeth Maura Vogel. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|AbstractIn {{a recent}} {{publication}} [(1987) FEBS Lett. 210, 195 – 198] the authors claim {{the use of}} cytochrome c to detect superoxide anion underestimates the real rate of superoxide anion formation on the basis that: (i) the rate of uric acid formation by xanthine oxidase is about 4 -fold faster than the rate of cytochrome c reduction and (ii) hydrogen peroxide formed upon dismutation of the superoxide anion generated by xanthine oxidase is capable of reoxidizing ferrocytochrome c. That paper may have been misleading for readers not very familiar with the field of oxygen radicals, since both assumptions are, in fact, incorrect. In this report we demonstrate that the build up in concentration of H 2 O 2 during most reactions in which superoxide anion is being produced {{is not enough to}} affect the rate of cytochrome c reduction. Our results suggest that the authors may have been misled by an artifact due to exposure of the samples containing H 2 O 2 to <b>UV</b> <b>light,</b> which <b>generates</b> hydroxyl radicals by photolysis...|$|R
40|$|A novel photo-controllable micro-fluidic electroosmotic pump {{based on}} {{spiropyran}} monolithic polymers is presented {{here for the}} first time. Photochromic monolithic scaffolds have been synthesised within poly(tetrafluoroethylene) coated fused silica capillaries. These monoliths have a photochromic spiropyran monomer incorporated in the bulk by thermally induced copolymerisation with a cross-linking agent (divinylbenzene) and were encased in micro-fluidic devices to function as photo-controllable electroosmotic pumps (EOPs). Due to the presence of the spiropyran the monolith can exist in two forms: a zwitterionic merocyanine (MC) form and an uncharged spiropyran (SP). As both forms bare a net overall zero charge, an acidic electrolyte was used to produce a stable anodic electroosmotic flow (EOF), while still retaining the ability to switch between the SP and the MC forms, which exhibit different charge distributions. It was confirmed that visible light, which produces the SP form, caused an increase in EOF while <b>UV</b> <b>light,</b> which <b>generates</b> the MC form, caused a decrease in EOF. In this way the EOF from the chip was modified by light and not by changing the electric field, temperature or buffer pH, some of the more common methods of altering the EOF...|$|R
40|$|We used <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> to <b>generate</b> site-selective O- hole centers at three-coordinated corner oxygen {{sites on}} MgO nanocubes. These highly {{reactive}} O- radicals split H- 2 homolytically and, {{in the course}} of this reaction, become hydroxylated and produce hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen atoms adsorb predominantly at cube edges and dissociate into surface-trapped electrons and protons. We propose that the experimentally observed (H+) (e(-)) centers are formed adjacent to the hydroxyl groups generated in the homolytic splitting process and can be defined as (H+) (3 C) center dot(e(-)) (H+) (NC) centers where 3 C and NC refer to the coordination numbers of the corresponding hydroxylated oxygen sites. Our ab initio embedded cluster calculations reveal that the electronic properties of (H+) (3 C) center dot(e(-)) (H+) (4 C) centers situated along MgO nanocube edges are consistent with both the electron-paramagnetic-resonance signal parameters and the reported optical-absorption properties. The transformation of corner O- centers into the (H+) (3 C) center dot(e(-)) (H+) (NC) -type centers prevents their recombination with electronic surface centers and, hence, significantly alters the electronic structure of MgO nanocubes by introducing shallow electron traps...|$|R
30|$|As a {{potential}} photocatalyst, BiPO 4 {{has recently been}} extensively studied [10 – 12]. It {{has been reported that}} the photocatalytic activity of BiPO 4 is strongly dependent on its crystal structure [13] and the monoclinic phase BiPO 4 showed a better photocatalytic performance than that of P 25 for the photodegradation of organic contaminants under UV irradiation [14]. However, BiPO 4 had a wide band gap of about 3.8  eV and thus can only be excited by <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> to <b>generate</b> electron-hole pairs [11]. In order to improve the visible-light utilization of BiPO 4, many efforts have been taken. Lin et al. fabricated Ag 3 PO 4 /BiPO 4 heterojunction with enhanced photocatalytic ability under visible-light irradiation [15]. Duo et al. reported that BiPO 4 /BiOCl heterojunction also had enhanced photocatalytic activity [16]. Li et al. found that BiPO 4 /g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction could efficiently respond to visible-light irradiation [17]. Besides, Zhang et al. reported that BiPO 4 /reduced graphene oxide composites with specific surface areas had better photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MB [18]. Whereas, coupling of BiPO 4 with other semiconductors is still meaningful for improving light absorption in the visible spectrum and suppressing the recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs more effectively.|$|R
40|$|The main {{telescope}} of JEM-EUSO {{will determine}} Ultra High Energy Cosmic Ray properties {{by measuring the}} <b>UV</b> fluorescence <b>light</b> <b>generated</b> in {{the interaction between the}} cosmic rays and the atmosphere. Therefore, cloud information is crucial for a proper interpretation of the data. JEM-EUSO will observe the clouds in the field of view of the telescope making use of an atmospheric monitoring system, which consists of a LIDAR and an IR Camera. To retrieve the cloud top height from IR images two different methodologies will be used. The first one is based on stereo vision algorithms and requires two different views of the same scene. The second one is based on the relationship between the cloud top temperature and the cloud top height. From the IR camera the brightness temperature can be retrieved, thus the developed Split Window Algorithm retrieves the real cloud temperature from the brightness temperature in two spectral bands. This article presents a preliminary work, in which both methodologies are compared with the height given by MODIS. The stereo system is provided by the two geostationary satellites MSG- 2 and MSG- 3. The Split Window Algorithm has been tested in MODIS images of bands 31 and 32. This initial work is a first step to compare a very simplified version of both methodologies...|$|R
40|$|The Japanese Experiment Module–Extreme Universe Space Observatory (JEM-EUSO) is a wide-field (+/-~ 30 °of aperture) 2. 5 m {{refractor}} {{telescope to}} be installed in the International Space Station (ISS). The instrument looks downward from its orbit, into Earthâ€™s atmosphere, with the main objective of observing ultra-violet (<b>UV)</b> fluorescence <b>light</b> <b>generated</b> by Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) extensive air showers (EAS). It is a frontier particle-physics experiment, {{the first of its}} kind. The validation of the technical readiness level of such a complex and unique instrument requires prototypes at several levels of integration. At the highest level, the EUSO-Balloon instrument has been conceived, through French space agency (CNES). At a smaller scale and in suborbital flight, EUSO-Balloon integrates all the sub-systems of the full space JEM-EUSO telescope, allowing end-to-end testing of hardware and interfaces, and to probing the global detection chain and strategy, while improving at the same time our knowledge of atmospheric and terrestrial UV background. EUSO-Balloon will be flown by CNES for the first time from Timmins, Canada; on spring 2014. This article presents the low-voltage power supply (LVPS) subsystem development for the EUSO-Balloon instrument. This LVPS is the fully operational prototype for the space instrument JEM-EUSO.

40|$|Cockayne {{syndrome}} (CS) {{is a rare}} recessive childhood-onset neurodegenerative disease, {{characterized by}} a deficiency in the DNA repair pathway of transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. Mice with a targeted deletion of the CSB gene (Csb−/−) exhibit a much milder ataxic phenotype than human patients. Csb−/− mice that are also deficient in global genomic repair [Csb−/−/xeroderma pigmentosum C (Xpc) −/−] are more profoundly affected, exhibiting whole-body wasting, ataxia, and neural loss by postnatal day 21. Cerebellar granule cells demonstrated high TUNEL staining indicative of apoptosis. Purkinje cells, identified by the marker calbindin, were severely depleted and, although not TUNEL-positive, displayed strong immunoreactivity for p 53, indicating cellular stress. A subset of animals heterozygous for Csb and Xpc deficiencies was more mildly affected, demonstrating ataxia and Purkinje cell loss at 3 months of age. Mouse, Csb−/−, and Xpc−/− embryonic fibroblasts each exhibited increased sensitivity to <b>UV</b> <b>light,</b> which <b>generates</b> bulky DNA damage that is a substrate for excision repair. Whereas Csb−/−/Xpc−/− fibroblasts were more UV-sensitive than either single knockout, double-heterozygote fibroblasts had normal UV sensitivity. Csb−/− mice crossed with a strain defective in base excision repair (Ogg 1) demonstrated no enhanced neurodegenerative phenotype. Complete deficiency in nucleotide excision repair therefore renders the brain profoundly sensitive to neurodegeneration in specific cell types of the cerebellum, possibly because of unrepaired endogenous DNA damage that is a substrate for nucleotide but not base excision repair...|$|R
