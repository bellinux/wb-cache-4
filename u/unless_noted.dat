5|$|The {{analysis}} of Sudoku falls into two main areas: analyzing {{the properties of}} (1) completed grids and (2) puzzles. Also studied are computer algorithms to solve Sudokus, and to develop (or search for) new Sudokus. Analysis has largely focused on enumerating solutions, with results first appearing in 2004. There are many Sudoku variants, partially characterized by size (N), and the shape of their regions. <b>Unless</b> <b>noted,</b> discussion in this article assumes classic Sudoku, i.e. N=9 (a 9×9 grid and 3×3 regions). A rectangular Sudoku uses rectangular regions of row-column dimension R×C. Other variants include those with irregularly-shaped regions or with additional constraints (hypercube) or different constraint types (Samunamupure).|$|E
