40|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces play an {{important}} role in improving quality of life and sustainability in cities and require a careful empirical assessment. Several factors such as social, economic, ecological or planning aspects, and several functions such as utilization, production, employment, education, regulation and preservation of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces form the basis for the determination of the criteria and indicators relevant for the assessment of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces. This multi-faceted ramification of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces needs therefore, a multidimensional evaluation approach in an urban policy context. The aim of this paper is to investigate the complex and heterogeneous structure of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces from a multi-faceted assessment perspective. The paper examines <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces from the viewpoint of quantity and availability of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces, changes in green spaces, planning of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces, financing of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces and level of performance, on the basis of a comparison of 24 European cities by deploying a multi-criteria analysis for mixed quantitative and qualitative information, coined Regime Analysis.

40|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces often form urban cool islands (UCIs), {{which are}} {{important}} for human health and urban sustainability. Previous studies have emphasized the cooling effects of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces on their surrounding areas at landscape level. Less attention, however, has been directed to effects of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> space patterns on their own UCIs at patch level. In this study, we focused {{on the effects of}} spatial patterns of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> patches on their own surface UCIs. The <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces of Beijing, China, were extracted from one QuickBird image and were classified as Trees, Shrubs, Grass, Crops, River and Lake. Land surface temperatures (LSTs) were derived from four Landsat images, each in one season. The UCI was represented by the minimum LST of each <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> patch. Results showed spatial patterns of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> patches had significant effects on their UCIs in four seasons. In detail, the size, edge and connectivity of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces all affected the UCIs negatively, and the influence was stronger in warm seasons. Shape of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> space also had effects on UCIs, but the effects were stronger in cool seasons. Great differences were found between predictive values of metrics for different green types. Shape metrics were more important for indicating UCIs of River, Trees and Crops than were patch size and connectivity. However, patch size and connectivity metrics were more effective in determining UCIs of Shrubs, Grass and Lake than were shape metrics. Further, among shape metrics, only shape index was a good indicator of UCIs. The {{results of this study suggest}} that a combination of specific <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> types and pattern metrics are a prerequisite for analyzing the influence of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> patterns on UCIs and for <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> design.

However, few studies have explored the relationships between <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces and LST across different seasons at different spatial scales. In this study, using Changchun, China as a case study, landscape ecology and comparative approaches were employed quantitatively to investigate the effects of the composition and configuration of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces on the urban thermal environments. LST maps were retrieved from Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data acquired on four dates that represented four different seasons, and detailed information of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces was extracted from high resolution imagery GF- 1. Normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) and six landscape metrics at patch, class, and landscape level were used to characterize the spatial patterns of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces. The results showed that <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces did have significant cooling effects in all seasons, except for winter, but the effects varied considerably across the different seasons and green types, and seemed to depend on the NDVI and size of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces. Compared to shape metrics, the negative relationships between the LST and the area and the NDVI of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces were more significant. Both the composition and configuration of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces can affect the distribution of LST.

40|$|Over {{the last}} three decades solid {{empirical}} evidence for the positive influence of greenery on human psychological and cognitive functioning has been steadily accruing. Based on this evidence, researchers and practitioners increasingly realize the importance of <b>urban</b> <b>greening</b> as a strategic activity to promote human wellbeing. Although commercial and retail activities constitute a significant and influential component of urban contexts, a concern is that the stakeholders involved (e. g. merchants) can sometimes be reluctant to integrate vegetation in commercial districts. This can be an important stumbling block for the process of <b>urban</b> <b>greening.</b> In this paper we introduce the concept of Biophilic Store Design (BSD) as the retail design strategy to consciously tap the beneficial effects of vegetation. The central aim {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate that the reluctance of certain retail stakeholders to integrate greening practices like BSD is unjustified. Two lines of evidence in support of this claim will be discussed. On the one hand, we sketch a conceptual framework which supports the view that BSD can have restorative effects for those implied in store environments. On the other hand, we review Wolfs multi-study research program on the effects of <b>urban</b> <b>greening</b> on consumer behavior, attitudes, and perceptions. These two lines of evidence show that commercial activities and <b>urban</b> <b>greening</b> are not to be considered as antagonistic but as mutually reinforcing practices. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

This thesis therefore attempted to link biodiversity and recreational values of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces through an interdisciplinary research of trade-offs and synergies between biodiversity conservation and human recreation. The interdisciplinary research comprised a methodological review followed by three interlinked case studies in Helsingborg employing different methods and having different research questions, but conducted partly on the same sites. The review focused on biotope mapping where a biotope mapping model integrated with vegetation structure was developed as a further contribution to the methodology. In the first case study the modified biotope mapping model was tested to identify biodiversity values in an <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> space. In the second case study, different user groups' perceptions of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces were examined by self-reported identification of the eight perceived sensory dimensions and linked to the green spaces' biotope characteristics. The third case study was an in-depth and on-site exploration of the relationship between preference and biodiversity in an <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> space context adopting the Visitor-Employed Photography (VEP) method. The results suggest that - Biodiversity values in <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces can be indicated through modified biotope mapping involving vegetation structures. - People can perceive recreational values in <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces through eight sensory dimensions. Each dimension is furthermore associated with biotopes. The more diverse biotopes an <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> space encompasses, the more frequently the eight sensory dimensions could be perceived. Urban forests were more frequently perceived as nature and rich in species than open green spaces. - Preference is not positively related to high biodiversity. The VEP study revealed on-site preference for biodiversity to be highly context-specific, mainly triggered by specific features rather than the overall scenery and character of the setting. These results can be used for <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> space planning and management to maximize both biodiversity and recreational benefits in <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces in practice. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces play a {{key role}} in {{improving}} the liveability of our towns and cities. The quality and viability of cities depend largely on the design, management and maintenance of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> as well as of open and public spaces in order to fulfil their role as an important social constellation and a visual focus. Actually, <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces are seen as an important contribution to a sustainable development of cities. However, the potential of green spaces is not always realized, so that current management practices are sometimes sub-optimal. From a “policy perspective”, the results of several case studies have shown important needs and priorities for the development and management of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces. It is of strategic importance to compare and evaluate <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> space policies for highlighting the “best practices” for relevant policy recommendations and guidance for society and planning authorities to improve the quality of life in cities. The present study investigates <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> spaces from a policy evaluation perspective and analyses European cities in order to obtain strategic and policy relevant information on the key features of <b>urban</b> <b>green.</b> The study aims to compare and evaluate the current management practices in European cities on the basis of the performance of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> space policies. The data and information used for comparison and evaluation are based on extensive survey questionnaires filled out by relevant departments or experts of municipalities in European cities that aim to share their experience in innovative green space policies and strategies. A recently developed artificial intelligence method is deployed to assess and identify the most important factors that are responsible for successes and failures of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> space policies. This approach reveals the most critical policy variables. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to shed new light on urban common {{property}} systems. We deal with urban commons in relation to urban green-space management, referring to them as <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> commons. Applying a property-rights analytic perspective, we synthesize information on <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> commons from three case-study regions in Sweden, Germany, and South Africa, and elaborate on their role for biodiversity conservation in urban settings, with a focus on business sites. Cases cover both formally established types of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> commons and bottom-up emerged community-managed habitats. As our review demonstrates, the right to actively manage <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> space is a key characteristic of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> commons whether ownership to land is in the private, public, the club realm domain, or constitutes a hybrid of these. We discuss the important linkages among urban common property systems, social–ecological learning, and management of ecosystem services and biodiversity. Several benefits can be associated with <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> commons, such as a reduction of costs for ecosystem management and as designs for reconnecting city-inhabitants to the biosphere. The emergence of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> commons appears closely linked to dealing with societal crises and for reorganizing cities; hence, they play a key role in transforming cities toward more socially and ecologically benign environments. While a range of political questions circumscribe the feasibility of <b>urban</b> <b>green</b> commons, we discuss their usefulness in management of different types of urban habitats, their political justification and limitation, their potential for improved biodiversity conservation, and conditions for their emergence. We conclude by postulating some general policy advic...|$|R
