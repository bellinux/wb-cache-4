5|$|Swannell {{played as}} a forward, {{and in his}} last Test {{specifically}} at number eight. He was an unconventional and hard rugby player, known for his violent play. He would turn up for training in <b>unwashed</b> kit, and wore the same pair of breeches for every game, again <b>unwashed.</b> His poor personal hygiene and overly violent playing style, made him an unpopular character {{in the eyes of}} other players.|$|E
5|$|Carrots can {{be stored}} for several months in the {{refrigerator}} or over winter in a moist, cool place. For long term storage, <b>unwashed</b> carrots can {{be placed in a}} bucket between layers of sand, a 50/50 mix of sand and wood shavings, or in soil. A temperature range of 32 to 40°F (0 to 5°C) is best.|$|E
5|$|Matangi {{is often}} {{associated}} with pollution, inauspiciousness and the periphery of Hindu society, which is embodied in her most popular form, known as Ucchishta-Chandalini or Ucchishta-Matangini. She is described as an outcaste (Chandalini) and offered left-over or partially eaten food (Ucchishta) with <b>unwashed</b> hands or food after eating, both of which are considered to be impure in classical Hinduism.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{vaccine for}} the common cold. The primary methods of {{prevention}} are hand washing; not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with <b>unwashed</b> hands; and staying away from other sick people. Some evidence supports the use of face masks. No cure {{for the common}} cold exists, but the symptoms can be treated. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help with pain. Antibiotics should not be used. Evidence does not support a benefit from cough medicines.|$|E
5|$|A few sheep {{conditions}} are transmissible to humans. Orf (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. Cutaneous anthrax is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores {{can be transmitted}} in <b>unwashed</b> wool. More seriously, the organisms that can cause spontaneous enzootic abortion in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women. Also of concern are the prion disease scrapie and {{the virus that causes}} foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), as both can devastate flocks. The latter poses a slight risk to humans. During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} imagined Darcy to be dark despite no such {{references in}} the novel and asked Firth to dye black his light-brown hair, eyebrows and lashes; they instructed all male actors to let their hair grow before filming and shave off their moustaches. Three brunette wigs were made to cover Ehle's short, blonde hair and one wig for Alison Steadman (Mrs. Bennet) because of her thick, heavy hair. Susannah Harker's (Jane) hair was slightly lightened to contrast with Elizabeth's and was arranged in a classic Greek style to highlight the character's beauty. Mary's plainness was achieved by painting spots on Lucy Briers's face; her hair was greased to suggest an <b>unwashed</b> appearance and was arranged to emphasise the actress's protruding ears. As Kitty and Lydia were too young and wild to have their hair done by the maids, the actresses' hair was not changed much. Makeup artist Caroline Noble had always considered Mr. Collins a sweaty character with a moist upper lip; she also greased David Bamber's hair {{and gave him a}} low parting to suggest baldness.|$|E
5|$|The typical prey {{consists}} of surface organisms such as small fish, squid, crustaceans and jellyfish. The storm petrel will also eat offal and oily food, often located by smell, and will follow ships. In the Atlantic, {{more than half}} the food items are zooplankton and the fish caught include small herring and sprats; whale carcasses are scavenged where available. During digestion, the plankton is quickly converted to an oily orange liquid that owes its colour to carotenoids. Larger prey items take longer to digest. The oil, rich in vitamin A, is produced by a large gland in the stomach. The Mediterranean subspecies' diet is mainly fish, particularly Mediterranean sand eels. Petrels also catch opossum shrimps from waters close to the colony. Bluefin tuna farms are exploited on the Maltese island of Filfla; birds from the large local colony feed on the <b>unwashed</b> food fed to the farmed tuna, a mixture of fish, squid and prawns which produces a sizeable oily slick. Small numbers of insects are caught near breeding colonies, and some plant material, including angiosperm seeds and sorrel, has been found in the stomach contents. A study on Leach's storm petrel, which consumes similar items, showed that the petrels were snipping pieces off plant leaves in flight, but it could not be confirmed that this was in the course of catching insects. Nasal glands remove excess salt from seawater consumed by the petrel as a concentrated solution excreted through the nostrils.|$|E

Asanuma gets closer to the neighbor and starts imagining himself taking the role of the child's father. The day after he makes love to her, Asanuma finds that her husband has returned and Asanuma finally washes the underwear.|$|E
25|$|<b>Unwashed</b> silk chiffon may shrink up to 8% {{due to a}} {{relaxation}} of the fiber macrostructure, so silk should either be washed prior to garment construction, or dry cleaned. Dry cleaning may still shrink the chiffon up to 4%. Occasionally, this shrinkage can be reversed by a gentle steaming with a press cloth. There is almost no gradual shrinkage nor shrinkage due to molecular-level deformation.|$|E
25|$|Musashi {{contracted}} eczema in his infancy, {{and this}} adversely affected his appearance. Another story {{claims that he}} never took a bath {{because he did not}} want to be surprised unarmed. While the former claim may or may not have some basis in reality, the latter seems improbable. An <b>unwashed</b> member of the warrior caste would not have been received as a guest by such houses as Honda, Ogasawara, and Hosokawa. These and many other details are likely embellishments that were added to his legend, or misinterpretations of literature describing him.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{simplest}} methods of prevention and treatment focus on preventing infestation of body lice. Complete change of clothing, washing the infested clothing in hot water, {{and in some cases}} also treating recently used bedsheets all help to prevent typhus by removing potentially infected lice. Clothes also left unworn and <b>unwashed</b> for 7 days also cause both lice and their eggs to die, as they have no access to their human host. Another form of lice prevention requires dusting infested clothing with a powder consisting of 10% DDT, 1% malathion, or 1% permethrin, which kill lice and their eggs.|$|E
25|$|Guru Granth Sahib {{is always}} the focal point in any Gurudwara, being placed in the centre on a raised {{platform}} known as a Takht (throne), while the congregation of devotees sits {{on the floor and}} bow before the Guru as a sign of respect. Guru Granth Sahib is given the greatest respect and honour. Sikhs cover their heads and remove their shoes while in the presence of this sacred scripture, their eternal living Guru. Guru Granth Sahib is normally carried on the head and as a sign of respect, never touched with <b>unwashed</b> hands or put on the floor.|$|E
25|$|After a long, painful {{battle with}} infections, {{possibly}} {{brought on by}} his doctors' poking and probing the wound with <b>unwashed</b> hands and non-sterilized instruments, Garfield died on September 19, eleven weeks after being shot. Most modern physicians {{familiar with the case}} state that Garfield would have easily recovered from his wounds with sterile medical care, which was common in the United States ten years later, while Candice Millard argues that Garfield would have survived Guiteau's bullet wound had his doctors simply left him alone. Garfield's biographer Allan Peskin stated that medical malpractice did not contribute to Garfield's death; the inevitable infection and blood poisoning that would ensue from a deep bullet wound resulted in damage to multiple organs and spinal bone fragmentation.|$|E
25|$|When Corinna (wife) {{arrives with}} Mervyn {{it is clear}} that when we saw Nan in act 1, Jerome had {{modelled}} her on Corinna. In fact the actress who played Nan (the robot) in act 1 now plays Corinna (the wife) in act 2. Geain doesn't arrive at this point as she has gone to visit a shop first. We first see her on the video screen at the door to the flat. Because of her masculine hair and clothing Jerome initially mistakes her for a local hooligan, and she enters looking surly, <b>unwashed</b> and very unfeminine – in complete contrast to the delightful 9-year-old girl shown on screen in Act 1. This makes Jerome very upset. Nan/Zoe's child-minding programming kicks in and she takes Geain to the kitchen for a drink. When they return shortly afterwards Nan/Zoe has transformed Geain, who is now clean, feminine and wearing a night-dress. She is still uncooperative, but has already developed a degree of respect for Nan/Zoe who takes her to the bedroom to put her to bed.|$|E
25|$|In 1939 New Orleans, Charlie B. Barkin and Itchy Itchiford {{escape from}} the dog pound and return to a casino riverboat on the bayou, {{formerly}} run by Charlie and his business partner, Carface Caruthers. Refusing to share the profits with Charlie, Carface persuades him to leave town with 50% of the casino's earnings. Charlie agrees, but is later intoxicated and murdered by Carface. He is sent to Heaven, where he meets a whippet angel, who tells him that a gold watch representing his life has stopped. He steals and winds it, returning to Earth, but is told that if he dies again, he will not return to Heaven. After reuniting with Itchy, they discover that Carface has kidnapped a young orphaned girl named Anne-Marie, who {{has the ability to}} talk to animals and gain knowledge of a race's results beforehand, allowing Carface to rig the odds on the rat races and become rich. They rescue her, intending to use her abilities to get revenge on Carface, though Charlie tells her that they plan to give their winnings to the poor and help her find her parents. The next day at the race track, Charlie steals a wallet from a couple as they talk to Anne-Marie and become alarmed by her <b>unwashed</b> appearance.|$|E
25|$|Michelle gets {{involved}} with another married man, computer salesman, Danny Whiting (Saul Jephcott), who tells Michelle that his marriage is over, whilst trying to reconcile with his wife. Michelle moves in with Rachel Kominski (Jacquetta May), a lecturer who persuades Michelle to resume her studies and enroll at university. Michelle and Rachel become inseparable, and rumours about their sexuality prompt Michelle to start dating Clyde Tavernier (Steven Woodcock), a fellow single parent. Some of the Albert Square residents, including Arthur, view their interracial relationship with concern. Later that year, Clyde is falsely accused of murdering publican Eddie Royle (Michael Melia). With the police closing in, Clyde decides {{to leave with}} his son, Kofi (Marcel Smith), and Michelle decides to take Vicki and go with him. Their getaway fails and Clyde is imprisoned for 3 months, but Clyde catches Michelle in bed with fellow student Jack Woodman (James Gilbey), and ends the relationship. Jack comes to Walford, claiming he and Michelle {{are meant to be}} together. When she rejects his advances, he behaves erratically: he convinces Pauline that he is dating Michelle and steals her <b>unwashed</b> knickers, makes threatening phone calls and he injures himself to gain her sympathy. Michelle turns to Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) for help, and Jack disappears while they're visiting his parents who tell them about his mental instability. In March, Vicki is abducted from her playgroup and Jack is the prime suspect but he is cleared when the police eventually find Vicki with a woman named Audrey Whittingham (Shirley Dixon) and Michelle is reunited with her daughter. In October 1993, the truth about Vicki's paternity is made public throughout the Square, and in April 1994, Vicki finds out that Sharon is her sister.|$|E
500|$|Sidney Snell (played by Tony Slattery) is a smelly {{local and}} a {{frequent}} client of Peter who often finds ways to sue the local council. Slattery described Snell as an [...] "everyman anti-hero", with Wheeler calling him an [...] "unlikely guardian of Market Shipborough" [...] {{on account of his}} numerous attempts to stop building work. Snell develops a close friendship with the recently widowed Gloria in the first series. To emphasise his <b>unwashed</b> state, the wardrobe department rotated Snell's costume only once in the first series.|$|E
500|$|Among {{those at}} the station was Robert Todd Lincoln, who sixteen years before had watched his father die from an assassin's bullet. Garfield was taken on a {{mattress}} upstairs to a private office, where several doctors examined him, probing the wound with <b>unwashed</b> fingers. [...] At his request, Garfield was taken back to the White House, and his wife, then in New Jersey, was sent for. Blaine sent word to Vice President Arthur in New York City, who received threats against his life because of his animosity toward Garfield and Guiteau's statements.|$|E
500|$|Snodgrass's {{first-hand}} account describes Poe's {{appearance as}} [...] "repulsive", with unkempt hair, a haggard, <b>unwashed</b> face and [...] "lusterless and vacant" [...] eyes. His clothing, Snodgrass said, {{which included a}} dirty shirt but no vest and unpolished shoes, was worn and did not fit well. Dr. John Joseph Moran, who was Poe's attending physician, gives his own detailed account of Poe's appearance that day: [...] "a stained faded, old bombazine coat, pantaloons of a similar character, a pair of worn-out shoes run down at the heels, and an old straw hat". Poe was never coherent long enough to explain {{how he came to}} be in this condition, and it is believed the clothes he was wearing were not his own, not least because wearing shabby clothes was out of character for Poe.|$|E
500|$|As far as {{is known}} the book {{remained}} at Durham {{for the remainder}} of the Middle Ages, until the Dissolution, kept as a relic in three bags of red leather, normally resting in a reliquary, and there are various records of it being shown to visitors, the more distinguished of which were allowed to hang it round their neck for a while. [...] According to Reginald of Durham (d. c 1190) [...] "anyone approaching it should wash, fast and dress in an alb before touching it", and he recorded that a scribe called John who failed to do this during a visit by the Archbishop of York in 1153–54, and [...] "held it with <b>unwashed</b> hands after eating was struck down with a chill". [...] Books treated as relics are especially characteristic of Celtic Christianity; several of the surviving Irish book-shrines were worn in this way.|$|E
500|$|... {{commonly}} worn by grunge {{musicians in}} Washington were a [...] "mundane everyday style", {{in which they}} would wear the same clothes on stage that they wore at home. This Pacific Northwest [...] "slacker style" [...] or [...] "slouch look" [...] contrasted sharply with the [...] "wild" [...] mohawks, leather jackets and chains worn by punks. This everyday clothing approach was used by grunge musicians because authenticity was a key principle in the Seattle scene. The grunge look typically consisted of thrift store items and the typical outdoor clothing (most notably flannel shirts) of the region, as well as a generally unkempt appearance and long hair. For grunge singers, long hair was used [...] "as a mask to conceal the face" [...] so they can [...] "expres innermost thoughts"; Cobain is a notable example. Male grunge musicians were [...] "...unkempt......unshaven [...] with...tousled hair" [...] that was often <b>unwashed,</b> greasy and [...] "...matted [...] sheep-dog mop".|$|E
500|$|The Duke of Wellington {{arrived at}} Liverpool Road, the L's Manchester terminus, {{a little before}} 3.00pm. As the {{messengers}} sent to Parkside had warned, the crowd had become hostile; one observer described them as [...] "A slovenly, ragged set, with hair uncombed and beards unshaven, with waistcoats open, exhibiting <b>unwashed</b> skin, dirty linen, and bare necks." [...] While some present cheered, others—especially weavers—hissed the Duke and pelted his carriage with vegetables. Two tricolore flags were hoisted, and banners reading [...] "No Corn Laws" [...] and [...] "Vote by Ballot" [...] were waved. The passengers on the trains disembarked and headed to a buffet of cold meats in the L's warehouse. On disembarking from the train the RevThomas Blackburne learned {{for the first time}} that Huskisson was in his vicarage, and rushed home to Eccles by horse. Fearing the hostile crowd, Wellington refused to leave his carriage, sent for food to be brought in to him, and ordered that the locomotives be readied for return to Liverpool as soon as possible. At 4.37pm the trains began to pull out of Manchester to head back to Liverpool.|$|E
500|$|With [...] "Ray of Light", Madonna debuted her [...] "Earth Mother" [...] look, {{complete}} with long strawberry {{blond hair and}} bronzed body. Author Georges Claude Guilbert wrote in his book, Madonna as Postmodern Myth, that her [...] "straggly, expensively <b>unwashed</b> look" [...] was {{comparable to that of}} singer Alanis Morissette and to Venetian paintings. According to Madonna she went for an Italian Renaissance look, invoking work of painter Raphael and Botticelli. Guilbert found the singer's description as catering to postmodernism, in tune with the zeitgeist, and noted that {{it was just one of}} her [...] "many reinventions". The book recalled how Madonna [...] "quickly grew tired of the Botticelli-Earth Mother phase" [...] with subsequent singles being promoted with a new Asian inspired look. In the book Ex-foliations: Reading Machines and the Upgrade Path, author Terry Harpold commented about the time-lapse sequences, especially the image of a clock and its hands rotating past the hours. He felt that the clip portrays the daily life as a futile attempt for survival, enhanced by another shot showing the sonogram of a fetus in utero, and a hamster running on a wheel. Santiago Fouz-Hernández, one of the authors of Madonna's Drowned Worlds, described Madonna as esoteric in the clip, as well as [...] "skin-deep Beverly Hills spiritualism".|$|E
500|$|One of Gilbert's {{favourite}} comic themes is {{the elevation}} of an unqualified person {{to a position of}} high responsibility. In The Happy Land (1873), for example, Gilbert describes a world in which government offices are awarded to the person who has the least qualification to hold each position. In particular, the one who has never heard of a ship is appointed to the cabinet post of First Lord of the Admiralty. In Pinafore, Gilbert revisits this theme in the character of Sir Joseph, who rises to the same position by [...] "never go to sea". In later Gilbert and Sullivan operas, the characters Major-General Stanley in Pirates, and Ko-Ko in The Mikado, are similarly appointed to high office though lacking the necessary qualifications. Gilbert also pokes fun at party politics, implying that when Sir Joseph [...] "always voted at [...] party's call", he sacrificed his personal integrity. The [...] "commercial middle class" [...] (which was Gilbert's main audience) is treated as satirically as are social climbers and the great <b>unwashed.</b> In addition, the apparent age difference between Ralph and the Captain, even though they were babies nursed together, satirises the variable age of Thaddeus in The Bohemian Girl. The Times wrote, in reviewing the 1929 production, that Pinafore was quintessentially Gilbertian in that the absurdities of a [...] "paternal" [...] Captain and the [...] "ethics... of all romanticism" [...] are accepted [...] "unflinchingly" [...] and taken to their logical conclusion: [...] "It is the reference to actuality that is essential; without it, the absurdity will not stand starkly out".|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally, an Aran jumper is {{made from}} undyed cream-coloured báinín (pronounced [...] "bawneen"), a yarn made from sheep's wool, {{sometimes}} [...] "black-sheep" [...] wool. They were originally made with <b>unwashed</b> wool that still contained natural sheep lanolin, making the garment water-repellent.|$|E
2500|$|Ingestion of oocysts {{by humans}} or other warm-blooded animals {{is one of}} the common routes of infection. [...] Humans can be exposed to oocysts by, for example, {{consuming}} <b>unwashed</b> vegetables or contaminated water, or by handling the feces (litter) of an infected cat. [...] Although cats can also be infected by ingesting oocysts, they are much less sensitive to oocyst infection than are intermediate hosts.|$|E
2500|$|Some Athenians, {{especially}} those who disliked commerce, preferred a closed society {{and the rule of}} the few. They believed that the Spartan constitution was superior to their own. Some {{even went so far as}} to imitate Spartan manners by going around Athens long-haired and <b>unwashed,</b> like the Spartiates. Plato's Republic, which is set in the 5th century BC, gives credence to this claim by having Socrates opine that the Spartan or Cretan type of political regime is the favorite of [...] "the many".|$|E
2500|$|The chief {{constituent}} of valerian is a yellowish-green to brownish-yellow oil {{which is}} present in the dried root, varying from 0.5 to 2.0%, though an average yield rarely exceeds 0.8%. This variation in quantity is partly explained by location; a dry, stony soil yields a root richer in oil than one that is moist and fertile. The volatile oils that form the active ingredient are extremely pungent, somewhat reminiscent of well-matured cheese. Though some people remain partial to the earthy scent, some may find it to be unpleasant, comparing the odor to that of <b>unwashed</b> feet.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{completion}} of the cell block meant a roof over a prisoner's head, the amenities of the facility were sparse. [...] The cells measured 6 × , were constructed of soft brick, and had no plumbing or artificial lights. The building had no heating or ventilation, and, in a region which often experienced temperatures below [...] in the winter and above [...] in the summer, this made for very uncomfortable tenants. [...] To alleviate the discomfort, the administration used wood stoves to heat the building and oil lamps to light it, the smoke from which combined with the stench of bucketed human waste and <b>unwashed</b> bodies to make the environment rank.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Muncie was found <b>unwashed</b> and {{homeless}} {{by a police}} officer outside of Memorial Stadium in Berkeley. In 1989, Muncie was sentenced to 18 months in a federal prison in California after {{he pleaded guilty to}} intending to sell [...] of cocaine to a friend. He turned his life around after prison, pursuing business interests and sharing stories of his drug problems with at-risk youths. Muncie said his time in prison likely saved his life. [...] "I was behind bars, pointing fingers at everybody but myself. I finally realized that I’m in charge, that it’s me with the addiction," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|Two female mannequins {{in a scene}} {{somewhat}} like a supermarket checkout. One mannequin sits naked on a lavatory with items dangling from her head: a nurse's cap, rusty horseshoes, a deflated balloon, charred bits of wood. The other's head is enclosed in a bird cage. The scene is covered with detritus: <b>unwashed</b> bowls and spoons with porridge and salad dried on. The everyday items are from the artist's own home, as are the leftovers. Wilkes says of her work that it [...] "apprehends an end point {{in our understanding of}} things as they area point at which words become insufficient, and the naming of objects is disconnected from our experience of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 18 June 1815, Napoleon was {{defeated}} at Waterloo. Having idolised Napoleon for years, Hazlitt {{took it as}} a personal blow. The event seemed to him to mark the end of hope for the common man against the oppression of [...] "legitimate" [...] monarchy. Profoundly depressed, he took up heavy drinking and was reported to have walked around unshaven and <b>unwashed</b> for weeks. He idolised and spoiled his son, William Jr., but in most respects his household grew increasingly disordered over the following year: his marriage deteriorated, and he spent more and more time away from home. His part-time work as a drama critic provided him with an excuse to spend his evenings at the theatre. Afterwards he would then tarry with those friends who could tolerate his irascibility, the number of whom dwindled {{as a result of his}} occasionally outrageous behaviour.|$|E
2500|$|Recurrent {{humor is}} {{generated}} {{on the show}} by contrasting the 'squeaky-clean' habits of June and Ward with the 'grubby' ones of Wally and Beaver. While Ward and June stress cleanliness, bathing, and good grooming (ordering both boys to wash their faces, hands, and fingernails before dinner), both boys generally prefer being <b>unwashed</b> and dressed in dirty clothes. In the premiere episode, Wally and Beaver fake bathing by rumpling towels and tossing [...] "turtle dirt" [...] in the bathtub. In [...] "Cleaning Up Beaver", June and Ward commend Wally on his neat appearance and chide Beaver for his untidiness. When Wally calls Beaver a [...] "pig", Beaver moves into the guest room where he can be his own dirty, messy self without comment or criticism from others. Frightening shadows in the room force {{him back to his}} old bedroom and the safety of being with his brother. The two boys strike a middle ground: Beaver will be a bit tidier than he usually is and Wally will be a bit sloppier.|$|E
