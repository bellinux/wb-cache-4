5|$|Technology is {{researched}} {{at specific}} buildings, {{to which they}} are generally related; for example, religious research is done in temples and improved armor is researched in the storage pit. Technological advances come in many categories, such as military <b>upgrades</b> (better arms and armor for units), economic <b>upgrades</b> (increasing the efficiency of resource gathering), religious <b>upgrades</b> (faster conversion rates and more abilities for priests) and infrastructure <b>upgrades</b> (stronger fortifications and more resilient buildings). As basic technology research is completed, more advanced technologies may become available. Some technologies are not available to certain civilizations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Facing the {{pressure}} of increasing population, poverty and inequality during the rapid urbanization, the issue of informal urban <b>upgrading</b> has been {{paid more attention to}} in developing countries. Firstly, this paper explains the conception of informal city and points out the spacial and social character of informal city. Secondly, at the view of time sequence and <b>upgrading</b> motivity, three <b>upgrading</b> models of informal cities in developing countries are put forward and analyzed, which include the <b>upgrading</b> model of government-initiated interventions, the <b>upgrading</b> model of self-help approach, and the <b>upgrading</b> model of multiple participations. Thirdly, the enlightenment of informal urban <b>upgrading</b> in developing countries upon Chinese urban <b>upgrading</b> is put forward. At last, based on the analysis of the three <b>upgrading</b> models, a conclusion is drawn that the sustainable urban <b>upgrading</b> can’t be achieved by any single objective and sector. Keywords—Developing countries; informal city; urban upgrading; <b>upgrading</b> model. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Enterprise systems (ES) <b>upgrade</b> is {{a complex}} phenomenon, yet it is {{possible}} to reduce the complexity through understanding of the <b>upgrade</b> drivers. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the various <b>upgrade</b> drivers, in order to provide a detailed understanding of the factors driving <b>upgrade</b> decisions. Design/methodology/approach This research is grounded in a qualitative survey design. It utilises a web-based survey questionnaire and semi-structured interviews to collect data from 41 respondents representing 23 large organisations. The data were qualitatively analysed and coded to identify the various drivers and their influence on ES <b>upgrade</b> decisions. Findings The findings suggest that the <b>upgrade</b> decisions are dependent on establishing the need to <b>upgrade,</b> which is influenced by various drivers and stakeholders interests. In addition, the findings suggest that organisations would only opt to <b>upgrade</b> when benefits are aligned with the <b>upgrade</b> and when the decision makes business sense. Research limitations/implications In this paper, the authors propose that there is a relationship between the <b>upgrade</b> drivers and the <b>upgrade</b> strategy. However, qualitative studies can only formulate logical generalisations. Hence, future research could explore these associations through a quantitative study in order to provide probabilistic generalisation that offers either similar or conflicting arguments applicable to ES <b>upgrade</b> phenomenon. Originality/value This paper provides an alternative classification of <b>upgrade</b> drivers, and conceptualises an association between <b>upgrade</b> drivers and the <b>upgrade</b> strategy, which in turn facilitates minimising disruptions and <b>upgrade</b> risks...|$|R

5000|$|After {{powering}} up a player, they retain that <b>upgrade</b> throughout {{the duration of}} the game. However, if that player gets overworked during the game, they may [...] "blow up" [...] and lose their <b>upgrade.</b> When human players blow up, they return to their normal state before the <b>upgrade.</b> Conversely, when a robot <b>upgrade</b> blows up, it turns into a dead robot. A dead robot turns gray and loses all its attributes, giving it a zero in all four categories (hitting, fielding, pitching, and chance). It can still be used during the game, but it is essentially a worthless player. After blowing up, an <b>upgraded</b> player can always be re-upgraded {{as long as you have}} the money. When you <b>upgrade</b> a player to A, you can also spend the money to have them further <b>upgraded</b> to B or C, although you pay full price for the <b>upgrade</b> (you don't get a discount for having previously <b>upgraded).</b> You cannot <b>upgrade</b> a player with the same <b>upgrade</b> they already have until they lose their power.|$|R

5|$|Dishonored 2 is an action-adventure stealth {{game played}} from a first-person perspective. After playing as Empress Emily Kaldwin during the prologue, players {{may decide to}} play either as Emily or as Corvo Attano (the protagonist from the {{previous}} game). Side missions unlock alternate methods of assassination, non-lethal approaches and paths to navigate the main mission. Both characters wield swords, pistols, crossbows, a retractable blade, grenades and mines—all of which are upgradable. <b>Upgrades</b> may be purchased at black market shops found throughout the levels, and blueprints scattered across levels unlock new potential <b>upgrades.</b> Coin is required to buy these <b>upgrades,</b> which again may be found throughout a level or gained from other collectibles, like stealing paintings. Players can choose whether to play stealthily or not, and can finish the game without taking a life. Health elixirs and food consumables will restore health, while mana elixirs replenish mana.|$|E
5|$|Each planet {{offers a}} {{possible}} quest or {{challenge to the}} player. Challenges are tactical battles in which the player must fight against a variety of enemies. However, ships can only be harmed from behind or below; attacks from any other position will be countered by the ships' shields. Upon succeeding, a new chapter {{is added to the}} player's character's story, and the player is rewarded with ship <b>upgrades.</b> These <b>upgrades</b> are used to customize ships with improvements, such as increased firing speed or heavier rear armor. The <b>upgrades</b> available to the player upon finishing each encounter with an enemy can vary, so the player may not receive the same upgrade by playing the same encounter in two different adventures. Flotilla has cooperative and split-screen multiplayer modes that can be played with an additional Xbox 360 controller.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact on stock prices of a major <b>upgrade</b> to the New York Stock Exchange's trading environment. The <b>upgrade</b> {{improved}} information dissemination on the trading floor and reduced the latency in reporting trades and quotes. The portion of the <b>upgrade</b> that reduced latency for electronic orders had significant impacts on liquidity, turnover, and returns. A portfolio that is long stocks undergoing the <b>upgrade</b> in the first 20 days of the <b>upgrade</b> and short stocks receiving the <b>upgrade</b> later has a return of roughly 3 % over the period.

40|$|Few {{organizations}} {{choose to}} <b>upgrade</b> their systems despite {{the benefits of}} new features and additional functionality such as web based services offered by <b>upgrading</b> Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. The {{reason for this is}} <b>upgrading</b> an ERP system remains a complex undertaking which requires strategies to minimise disruption to business operations. High costs and risks associated with <b>upgrading</b> imply that the decision to <b>upgrade</b> is not trivial and should be undertaken for the right reasons that make business sense and have clear benefits. Conversely opting not to <b>upgrade</b> has long term implications such as using outdated ERP systems which lack continued technical support or obtaining support at a very steep price. The paper will explore factors and challenges that influence ERP <b>upgrade</b> decisions and identify key features to streamline ERP <b>upgrade.</b> The outcome identifies that decision support methodologies and techniques could {{play a significant role in}} streamlining ERP <b>upgrading</b> decision...|$|R

This modernised Su-33 was to compete with a potential Chinese indigenous version of the original Su-33, and to encourage orders from the Russian Navy. Major <b>upgrades</b> to the aircraft included more powerful (132kN, 29,800lbf) AL-31-F-M1 engines and a larger weapons carriage; <b>upgrades</b> to the radar and weapons were not possible at the time due to funding constraints. According to military author Richard Fisher, it has been speculated that further modifications to a new production batch would include a phased-array radar, thrust-vectoring nozzles, and long-range anti-ship missiles.|$|E

5|$|In July 2013, the Air Force began a fleet-wide {{technological}} upgrade of its B-52 bombers called Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) {{to modernize}} electronics, communications technology, computing, and avionics {{on the flight}} deck. CONECT <b>upgrades</b> include software and hardware such as new computer servers, modems, radios, data-links, receivers, and digital workstations for the crew. One update is the ARC-210 Warrior beyond-line-of-sight software programmable radio able to transmit voice, data, and information in-flight between B-52s and ground command and control centers, allowing the transmission and reception of data with updated intelligence, mapping, and targeting information; previous in-flight target changes required copying down coordinates. The ARC-210 allows machine-to-machine transfer of data, useful on long-endurance missions where targets may have moved {{before the arrival of}} the B-52. The aircraft will be able to receive information through Link-16. CONECT <b>upgrades</b> will cost $1.1 billion overall and take several years. Funding has been secured for 30 B-52s; the Air Force hopes for 10 CONECT <b>upgrades</b> per year, but the rate has yet to be decided.|$|E
