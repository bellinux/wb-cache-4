50|$|Administrative {{liability}} in English law {{is an area}} of law concerning the tortious liability of public bodies in English law. The existence of private law tort applying to public bodies is a result of Diceyan constitutional theory suggesting that it would be unfair if a separate system of liability existing for government and officials. Therefore a public body which acts ultra vires is liable in tort is a cause of action can be established just like any individual would be. An <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> <b>action</b> will not, per se, give rise to damages Therefore a claimant will have to fit into one of the recognised private law courses of action. These areas in which a public body can incur private {{liability in}} tort were described by Lord Browne Wilkinson in X and others (minors) v Bedfordshire County Council 1995 3 All ER 353 (HL).|$|E

40|$|The author {{analyzes}} EU’s {{response to}} the ongoing economic crisis, focusing {{on the problem of}} legislative and institutional fragmentation. She argues that the authoritarian crisis management – fueled by “crisis” discourse - subverted democratic accountability by its reliance on executive discretion and intergovernmentalism. Through an analysis of European Court of Justice’s case law as well as {{a close look at the}} exact workings and implications of European Central Bank’s <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> <b>actions,</b> she shows how Lisbon Treaty was sacrificed to the exigency of creating an Ersatz Union law more pliable to the immediate concerns of reforming the EMU. She holds that the intergovernmental instruments not only “unconstitutionally” requisitioned the involvement of EU institutions, but also established a political administration unresponsive to democratic accountability, damaging the legitimacy of the Union. The resulting subjugation of the political and social constitution to economic conditions threatens an abdication of law and undermines the integrity of the Union legal order...|$|R
40|$|This thesis focusses on the {{assessing}} {{the legality of}} the responses of the IAEA, the UN Security Council and certain member states to the Iranian nuclear crisis from 2006 to 2015. The purpose of this thesis is to highlight the fact that the Iranian situation was primarily a legal dispute, encompassing various complex legal questions which were largely side-stepped in the handling of the crisis. This thesis examines the mandates of the IAEA and Council {{to make the case that}} in numerous instances both engaged in <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> <b>actions</b> in their handling of the Iranian issue. This thesis examines the referral of the case by the IAEA to the Council and the resulting enforcement measures, their compatibility with the strictures of the Charter and the Council’s powers. Unilateral sanctions imposed by the US and EU are analysed as countermeasures and their legality as such is assessed, as are the legal issues associated with forcible counter-proliferation measures of surgical strike and cyber-attack. Reflecting on the 2016 outcome, this thesis concludes that Iranian nuclear crisis was prolonged and exacerbated by the failure to treat the situation as a legal, rather than purely political issue...|$|R

50|$|The Court of Appeal {{held that}} the {{transaction}} was not <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> and void. Simply because a transaction is entered for an improper purpose {{does not make it}} <b>ultra</b> <b>vires.</b> He emphasised the distinction between an act which is entered into for an improper purpose (which is not beyond the capacity of a company, or void) and an act which is wholly outside a company's objects (and hence <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> and void). However, it was unenforceable because British Steel, with knowledge of the irregularity, could not rely on a presumption of regularity in the company’s internal management. Since British Steel ‘constructively knew’ about the lack of authority, they could acquire no rights under the guarantee. On <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> Browne-Wilkinson LJ said the following.|$|R

50|$|Judicial {{control is}} {{exercised}} through {{the means of}} judicial review. Because delegated legislation is made by a person exercising a power conferred by an Act of Parliament (Parent or Enabling Act) for a specified purpose, rather than by Parliament exercising its sovereign law-making powers, it can be quashed by the courts if they conclude that it is <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> (literally, outside the powers conferred by the parent Act). There {{are two types of}} <b>ultra</b> <b>vires,</b> that being Substantive <b>ultra</b> <b>vires,</b> meaning the substance of the subordinate legislation has gone beyond the powers set out by the Parent Act and is therefore deemed void. - Commissioners of Customs and Excise V Cure and Deeley Ltd (1962). The second <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> is Procedural <b>ultra</b> <b>vires,</b> which means the procedure taken into making the delegated legislation has gone beyond the powers set out by the Parent Act. - Aylsebury Mushroom Case (1972). The final form of judicial control is unreasonableness. This literally means that the secondary legislation is simply so unreasonable that no reasonable person would make such a law and therefore on those grounds it is deemed void by the courts and quashed. - R(Rogers) V Swindon NHS Trust (2006).|$|R

Broad <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> applies if there is an abuse of power (e.g., Wednesbury unreasonableness or bad faith) or a failure to exercise an administrative discretion (e.g., acting at the behest of another or unlawfully applying a government policy) or application of discretionary powers in irrational and wrong way. Either doctrine may entitle a claimant to various prerogative writs, equitable remedies or statutory orders if they are satisfied.|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of company law, the term 2 ̆ 2 <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> 2 ̆ 2 is {{normally}} used to describe acts that are {{beyond the scope of}} the powers of a corporation. Rules concerning <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> acts of companies have changed in recent years in mainland China, Taiwan and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (2 ̆ 2 Hong Kong 2 ̆ 2). It appears that in all of these parts of Greater China, the legal frameworks are now rather similar to each other and seem to resemble the rules that are applied in the Macau Special Administrative Region (2 ̆ 2 Macau 2 ̆ 2). This, of course, provokes questions: what are the reasons for these seemingly synchronized legislative developments, given the different political, economic and legal systems of these areas in Greater China? In particular, can any conclusion be drawn in regard to attempts to harmonize lawmaking in the region, or do the reasons for the aforementioned changes follow a global trend? The <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> doctrine was originally developed in the common law world but has ceased to be popular in many of these jurisdictions. Consequently, it is further interesting to inquire if (1) the reasons for abandoning the doctrine are the same in the West and in the Far East, and (2) if this means anything for the significance of the <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> doctrine. This article is divided as follows. Part II will briefly introduce the historical development and function of the <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> doctrine in the Western world.
