40|$|Objective(s) : We {{aimed to}} study the effect of {{trimetazidine}} (TMZ) on urethral wound repair. Materials and Methods: A total of 52 male rats were used; 8 groups were formed: 1 -week and 3 -week control (C 1,C 3), sham (S 1, S 3), oral (OT 1, OT 3), and intraurethral TMZ (IUT 1, IUT 3) groups. Serum and urine total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidant capacity (TOC), and 8 -hydroxy-deoxy-guanosine (8 -OHdG) were studied. Hematoxyline-Eosin {{was used for the}} histopathological study. In addition, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- α), interleukin 1 α, and β levels were compared across groups by an immunohistochemical method. Results: There were significant differences between C 3 and IUT 3, OT 3 and IUT 3 with respect to serum TAC in 3 -week groups (P= 0. 013; P = 0. 001). Serum TOC levels were significantly different between C 3 and IUT 3; S 3 and OT 3; and OT 3 and IUT 3 groups (P = 0. 024; P = 0. 019; P = 0. 000, respectively). Serum 8 -OHdG levels were significantly different between C 3 and OT 3 groups (P= 0. 033). In the immunohistochemical examination, C 1 and OT 1; C 1 and IUT 1; and S 1, S 3, OT 1, OT 3, IUT 1 groups were significantly different with respect to IL- 1 β staining (P= 0. 007; P = 0. 000; P= 0. 009), while {{there was a significant difference}} between C 3 and S 3 with respect to IL- 1 β (P = 0. 000). Conclusion: TMZ increased urinary total oxidant level; while increasing serum TAC levels in the long-term. It also reduced serum TAC levels in <b>urethral</b> <b>use</b> and caused an increase in serum TOC levels with minimal effects on DNA injury and repair. No effect was detected on IL 1 α and TNF, but partially reduced the effect on IL- 1 β levels...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to report the long-term outcome of the children who underwent dilation of the <b>urethral</b> stricture <b>using</b> guide wire and sheath dilator. Materials and Methods: From 1999 to 2004, a total of 52 children with documented urethral stricture were managed by <b>urethral</b> dilation <b>using</b> guide wire. Data on the cause of urethral stricture, operation, postoperative recovery, follow-up cystoscopic appearance, and patient’s outcome were audited and analyzed. Results: The mean age of the patients was 5. 6 ± 2. 3 years (range, 2 to 18 years). The mean period of the follow-up was 4. 5 ± 2. 4 years (range, 3. 8 to 6. 5 years). Twenty-two patients (42. 3 %) did not require any further surgical treatments. However, urethral stricture in 13 patients (25. 0 %) progressed significantly, and therefore, they needed further surgical interventions. The complications included minor urinary tract infections in 3 and bladder spasm in 2 patients. No case of false passage or sepsis was encountered. Conclusion: Guide wire-assisted urethral dilation avoids the risks associated with blind dilation techniques and continues to be a safe alternative for urethral strictures in selected cases. However, in our experience, less than half of the patients became “recurrence free” after two dilation attempts. We recommend that urethral dilation be considered only in selected cases and emergency settings. </p...|$|R

40|$|We {{performed}} {{an overview of}} the surgical techniques suggested for the treatment of anterior <b>urethral</b> strictures <b>using</b> MEDLINE. In applying the MEDLINE search, we used the "MeSH" (Medical Subject Heading) and "free text" protocols. The MeSH search was conducted by combining the following terms: "urethral stricture", "flap", "graft", "oral mucosa", "urethroplasty", "urethrotomy" and "failed hypospadias". Multiple "free text" searches were performed individually applying the following terms through all fields of the records: "reconstructive urethral surgery", "end-to-end anastomosis", "one-stage", "two stage". Descriptive statistics of the articles were provided. Meta-analyses were not employed. Seventy-eight articles were determined to be germane in this review. Six main topics were identified as controversial in anterior urethra surgery: the use of oral mucosa vs penile skin; the use of free grafts vs pedicled flaps in penile urethroplasty; the use of grafts vs anastomotic repair in bulbar <b>urethral</b> strictures; the <b>use</b> of dorsal vs ventral placement of the graft in bulbar urethroplasty; the use of definitive perineal urethrostomy vs one-stage repair in complex urethral strictures; the surgical options for patients with failed hypospadias repair. Different points of view are documented and presented in the literature by various authors from different countries. The aim of this clinical overview is to survey the main controversial issues in surgical reconstruction of the anterior urethra focusing on the use of flap or graft, substitute material, type of surgery and challenging situations, such as failed hypospadias or complex urethral stricture repair...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Dutasteride {{affects the}} {{prostate}} by reducing intraprostatic dihydrotestosterone and prostate tissue vascularity. We evaluated {{the effect of}} pretreatment with dutasteride for two weeks on perioperative and postoperative bleeding during transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Materials and Methods: Eighty-three patients who had benign prostatic hyperplasia together with the criteria for eligibility for TURP were included. The dutasteride group consisted of 40 patients who were treated with dutasteride (0. 5 mg/d) for two weeks before surgery, and the control group consisted of 43 patients who did not receive dutasteride. Blood loss was evaluated in terms of reduction in serum hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels, which were measured before, immediately after, and 24 hours after surgery. We also measured the durations of indwelling <b>urethral</b> catheter <b>use,</b> continuous saline bladder irrigation, and hospitalization. Results: Lower mean blood loss was observed in the dutasteride group {{than the control group}} immediately after and 24 hours after surgery (Delta Hb = 0. 65 +/- 1. 27 g/dL vs. 1. 16 +/- 0. 73 g/dL, 1. 30 +/- 1. 00 g/dL vs. 1. 86 +/- 1. 05 g/dL respectively, p = 0. 019, p = 0. 011;. Delta Hct = 1. 89 % +/- 3. 83 % vs. 3. 47 % +/- 2. 09 %, 3. 69 % +/- 2. 95 % vs. 5. 39 % +/- 3. 23 % respectively, p = 0. 016, p = 0. 011). In addition, there were fewer days of indwelling <b>urethral</b> catheter <b>use</b> (2. 95 +/- 1. 02 d vs. 3. 92 +/- 1. 14 d, p = 0. 000), continuous saline bladder irrigation (1. 81 +/- 1. 08 d vs. 2. 36 +/- 1. 06 d, p = 0. 016), and hospitalization after TURP (3. 95 +/- 1. 09 d vs. 4. 76 +/- 1. 19 d, p = 0. 001) in the dutasteride group.

40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction Urethral {{stricture}} {{disease is}} still {{a major problem in}} men. Many procedures are available for the treatment of urethral strictures; urethral dilatation is one of the oldest. The blind dilatation of urethral strictures may be a difficult and potentially dangerous procedure. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe safe <b>urethral</b> dilatation <b>using</b> amplatz renal dilator and to report outcomes. Materials and Methods From 2010 to 2014, a total of 26 men with primary urethral strictures were managed by <b>urethral</b> dilatation <b>using</b> amplatz renal dilators. The parameters analyzed included presentation of patients, retrograde urethrography (RGU) findings, pre-and postoperative maximum flow rate (Qmax) on uroflowmetry (UF) and post-void residual urine (PVR). Patients were followed-up at 1. 6 and 12 months. The technique described in this paper enables such strictures to be safely dilated after endoscopic placement of a suitable guidewire and stylet over which amplatz renal dilators are introduced. Results The mean age of the patients was 57. 6 (35 – 72) years. The median stricture length was 0. 82 (0. 6 – 1. 5) cm. Pre-operative uroflowmetry showed Qmax of 7. 00 (4 – 12) mL/sec and ultrasonography showed PVR of 75. 00 (45 – 195) mL. Postoperatively, Qmax improved to 18. 00 (15 – 22) mL/sec (p< 0. 001) at 1 month, 17. 00 (13 – 21) mL/sec (p< 0. 001) at 6 months and 15. 00 (12 – 17) mL/sec (p< 0. 001) at 12 months. The post-operative PVR values were 22. 50 (10 – 60) mL (p< 0. 001), 30. 00 (10 – 70) mL (p< 0. 001) and 30. 00 (10 – 70) mL (p< 0. 001) at 1. 6 12 months, respectively. The median procedure time was 15. 00 (12 – 22) minutes. None of the patients had a recurrence during a 12 -month period of follow-up. Conclusion Urethral dilatation with amplatz renal dilators avoids the risks associated with blind dilatation techniques. This tecnique is a safe, easy, well-tolerated and cost-effective alternative for treatment of urethral strictures...|$|R
40|$|Congenital {{anomalies}} {{that involve}} the distal segment of urogenital sinus (giving rise to female urethra and vagina) {{may lead to}} abnormal urethral development ranging from absent to markedly deficient urethra.

The response to the effect of the stent was assessed using symptom scores, peak flow rate (Qmax), residual urine volume (RUV), stent degradation, infection and outcome. During the treatment, there were not any inflammations found. The mechanical properties of the stent are almost the same as those of the PLLA stent without BaSO 4. Improvements in patient symptom score, mean Qmax and RUV were significant at the 18 month follow-up. The infection was not observed. The stent was taken out easily through urethral forceps.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{refinement}} to our original technique in MtF gender reassignment surgery. Our {{goal was to}} construct a neoclitoris, which is wet and covered with urethral neoprepuce. Since 1995 more than 300 transgender MtF patients have been operated at our institution. Our refinement {{has been applied to}} 12 cases and showed both excellent functional and cosmetic results during midterm follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During 2010 several sex reassignment surgeries have been performed using our new technique that includes: bilateral orchiectomy, removal of corpora cavernosa of the penis, formation of the neourethra with neomeatus, neovaginoplasty by inversion of penoscrotal skin flaps, construction of the neoclitoris with preservation of the neurovascular bundle and exterior vulva formation. The refinement consists in creating a neoclitoris embedded in <b>urethral</b> mucosa <b>using</b> <b>urethral</b> flaps. These flaps are in continuity with the previously spatulated urethra. The urethral plate is further incised distally in a Y fashion. The urethral flaps are sutured around the neoclitoris to form a neo-urethroclitoris covered by urethral neoprepuce, which resembles a real female clitoris. The neoclitoris is positioned in the anatomical position of the male suspensory ligament of the penis that is also the natural anatomical position of the female clitoris. RESULTS: With this method we are able to construct a clitoris with a normal sensitivity embedded in urethral mucosa that remains wet and hairless. It can be easily stimulated during sexual intercourse, as most of the patients reported great satisfaction and ability to reach orgasm. DISCUSSION: We want to emphasize how both the cosmetic results and functionality of the neovagina and neoclitoris are important in this type of surgery for {{the quality of life of}} our patients. We are still far from a perfect surgical solution, but we are further improving our technique and follow our aims step by step...|$|R

Methods: Prepubertal male albino rats were divided into 2 groups: 20 rats in the BTX-A group received BTX-A injection treatment during surgery and 10 rats in the control group received 0. 9 % saline solution injection. The penile skin was incised circumferentially and degloved. To make the urethral injury at a location ap-proximately 15 mm proximal to the external meatus, the urethra was cut transversally with scissors, from the 2 -o’clock to the 10 -o’clock position and then sutured by a single suture at the 6 -o’clock position.

Patients and Methods: We treated 40 patients with re-current bulbar and penile urethral strictures during a pe-riod of 4 years. Mean age was 40 years. All patients underwent single stage <b>urethral</b> reconstruction <b>using</b> non-tubularized dorsal onlay buccal mucosa graft. The length of stricture dealt with was {{in the range of}} 2. 5 cm to 12 cm. Follow-up was done at 3 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and then yearhv by uroflowmetry and if required by retrograde urethrogram. Results: Outcome was favourable in 38 patients (95 %). 1 patient (2. 5 %) required VIU. I patient (2. 5 %) died due to pulmonary embolism in immediate postoperative pe-riod. Conclusions: Buccal mucosa is easy to harvest. It has thin and well- vascularized lamina propria with efficient imbibitions. Free graft placed dorsally over the tunica gains the mechanical support of the corpora and obviates urethrocele or diverticula formation.

Materials and Methods From August 2010 to August 2013, 20 patients underwent BMG urethroplasty. The cause of stricture was Lichen sclerosis in 12 cases (60 %), Instrumentation in 5 cases (25 %), and unknown in 3 cases (15 %). Strictures were approached through a perineal skin incision and penis was invaginated into it to access the entire urethra. All the grafts were placed dorsolaterally, preserving the bulbospongiosus muscle, central tendon of perineum and one-sided attachement of corpus spongiosum. Procedure {{was considered to be}} failure if the patient required instrumentation postoperatively. Results Mean stricture length was 8. 5 cm (range 4 to 12 cm). Mean follow-up was 22. 7 months (range 12 to 36 months). Overall success rate was 85 %. There were 3 failures (meatal stenosis in 1, proximal stricture in 1 and whole length recurrent stricture in 1). Other complications included wound infection, urethrocutaneous fistula, brownish discharge per urethra and scrotal oedema.

The scaffolds were then seeded with hAMSCs prior to implantation in New Zealand male rabbits that had 2. 0 cm-long defects in the urethras. The rabbits were randomly divided into three groups. In group A, hAMSCs were grown on PLLA/PEG scaffolds for two days and then implanted to the urethral defects. In group B, only the PLLA/PEG scaffolds were used to rebuild the rabbit urethral defect. In group C, the urethral defect was reconstructed <b>using</b> a regular <b>urethral</b> reparation technique. The repair efficacy was compared among the three groups by examining the urethral morphology, tissue reconstruction, luminal patency, and complication incidence (including calculus formation, urinary fistula, and <b>urethral</b> stricture) <b>using</b> histological evaluation and urethral radiography methods. Findings from {{this study indicate that}} hAMSCs-loaded PLLA/PEG scaffolds resulted in the best urethral defect repair in rabbits, which predicts the promising application of a tissue engineering approach for urethral repair...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{determined}} and compared <b>urethral</b> pressure measurements <b>using</b> air charged and microtip catheters in a prospective, single-blind, randomized trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of 64 women referred for urodynamic investigation underwent sequential <b>urethral</b> pressure measurements <b>using</b> an air charged and a microtip catheter in randomized order. Patients were blinded {{to the type}} and sequence of catheter used. Agreement between the 2 catheter systems was assessed using the Bland and Altman 95 % limits of agreement method. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients of air charged and microtip catheters for maximum urethral closure pressure at rest were 0. 97 and 0. 93, and for functional profile length they were 0. 9 and 0. 78, respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficients and Lin's concordance coefficients of air charged and microtip catheters were r = 0. 82 and rho = 0. 79 for maximum urethral closure pressure at rest, and r = 0. 73 and rho = 0. 7 for functional profile length, respectively. When applying the Bland and Altman method, air charged catheters gave higher readings than microtip catheters for maximum urethral closure pressure at rest (mean difference 7. 5 cm H(2) O) and functional profile length (mean difference 1. 8 mm). There were wide 95 % limits of agreement for differences in maximum urethral closure pressure at rest (- 24. 1 to 39 cm H(2) O) and functional profile length (- 7. 7 to 11. 3 mm). CONCLUSIONS: For urethral pressure measurement the air charged catheter {{is at least as}} reliable as the microtip catheter and it generally gives higher readings. However, air charged and microtip catheters cannot be used interchangeably for clinical purposes because of insufficient agreement. Hence, clinicians should be aware that air charged and microtip catheters may yield completely different results, and these differences should be acknowledged during clinical decision making...|$|R
40|$|A {{practical}} protocol {{using the}} {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) was designed for detecting Chlamydia trachomatis in clinical samples. DNA was extracted from material collected on <b>urethral</b> swabs and <b>used</b> as substrate for the PCR. The target was a 600 basepair DNA segment of the multicopy plasmid that is common to all strains of the bacterium. Negative samples were checked for loss of DNA or presence of polymerase inhibitors by a second PCR, targeted to a conserved segment of the human genome. The whole procedure was tested on 216 men with non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU). All patients were independently assessed by tissue culture isolation (60 positive samples) and a commercial immunoenzymatic assay. The PCR protocol, while sufficiently simple for routine application, was reliable and, for the diagnosis of urethritis, at least as good as tissue culture isolation...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Hypospadias {{represents}} {{the most frequent}} penile anomaly. The most challenging part of hypospadias surgery is urethral reconstruction. Many various tissues are used (local skin flaps, bladder mucosa grafts, buccal mucosa grafts etc.) for {{the reconstruction of the}} neourethra. Objective. Our aim was to evaluate advantages and disadvantages of combined buccal mucosa graft and penile skin flap in urethral reconstruction in severe hypospadias repair. Methods. Between December 2005 and August 2009, 48 patients with severe hypospadias, aged from nine months to 12 years (mean age 23 months) underwent surgery. Thirty-four (71 %) had penoscrotal and 14 (29 %) scrotal hypospadias. Ventral penile curvature was present in all cases, and was corrected by incision of the short urethral plate. Urethroplasty was performed using a buccal mucosa graft combined with dorsal penile skin flap. Results. Mean follow-up was 22 months (range from 9 months to 3 years). Satisfactory functional and aesthetic results were achieved in 40 (83 %) patients. Fistula was noted in six cases and was solved by minor revision. Urethral stenosis in two cases was resolved by simple dilatation. Conclusion. <b>Urethral</b> reconstruction <b>using</b> the buccal mucosa graft and dorsal penile skin flap in severe hypospadias repair could be the method of choice. Using this technique, single stage urethral reconstruction is possible with satisfactory esthetical and functional results...|$|R
40|$|Urethral strictures and {{anomalies}} {{remain a}} challenging urological problem. Reconstructive plastic surgery {{has been shown}} to be the most effective way to treat them. There are two main types of urethroplasty: anastomosis (anastomotic urethroplasty) and expansion of the <b>urethral</b> lumen <b>using</b> of flaps and grafts (substitution urethroplasty). Currently the ideal material for substitution urethroplasty does not exist. Tissue engineering of the urethra seems to be one of the most promising approaches to address this problem. Various tissues-engineering techniques were proposed for substitution urethroplasty. In this study, tissue-engineering design was based on the decellularized cadaveric arterial wall. The study results demonstrated the feasibility of creating stable tissue-engineered structures with autologous cultured epithelial cells of the buccal mucosa and decellularized matrix from human cadaveric arterial wall (DMCAW). There was a complete engraftment of tissue-engineering design based on DMCAW and buccal mucosa cells, used for substitution urethroplasty in a patient with the bulbar urethral stricture. Postoperatively (within 4 months after surgery) no complications and/or adverse events were observed. However, in the late postoperative period (12 months) there was recurrence of urethral stricture in the middle of the tissue-engineering design and the native urethra that warranted another surgery. Tissue-engineering design based on DMCAW and autologous buccal mucosa is safe as a material for substitution urethroplasty. Further research is required to ascertain the effectiveness of the method. 7 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Techniques {{to treat}} {{urethral}} stricture and hypospadias are restricted, as substitution of the unhealthy urethra with tissue from other origins (skin, bladder or buccal mucosa) has some limitations. Therefore, {{alternative sources of}} tissue for <b>use</b> in <b>urethral</b> reconstructions are considered, such as ex vivo engineered constructs. To review recent literature on tissue engineering for human urethral reconstruction. A search {{was made in the}} PubMed and Embase databases restricted to the last 25 years and the English language. A total of 45 articles were selected describing the use of tissue engineering in urethral reconstruction. The results are discussed in four groups: autologous cell cultures, matrices/scaffolds, cell-seeded scaffolds, and clinical results of <b>urethral</b> reconstructions <b>using</b> these materials. Different progenitor cells were used, isolated from either urine or adipose tissue, but slightly better results were obtained with in vitro expansion of urothelial cells from bladder washings, tissue biopsies from the bladder (urothelium) or the oral cavity (buccal mucosa). Compared with a synthetic scaffold, a biological scaffold has the advantage of bioactive extracellular matrix proteins on its surface. When applied clinically, a non-seeded matrix only seems suited for use as an onlay graft. When a tubularized substitution is the aim, a cell-seeded construct seems more beneficial. Considerable experience is available with tissue engineering of urethral tissue in vitro, produced with cells of different origin. Clinical and in vivo experiments show promising results...|$|R
40|$|Laparoscopic {{adenomectomy}} is a feasible {{and effective}} surgical procedure. We have progressively simplified the procedure using barbed sutures and a technique we call “knotless” laparoscopic adenomectomy.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To compare, in {{the same}} children, urine culture results from bag- versus catheter-obtained {{specimens}} with catheter culture as the reference. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 192 non-toilet-trained children < 3 years of age from 2 emergency departments were recruited for this prospective cross-sectional study. All had positive urinalysis results from bag-obtained specimens that were systematically checked with a catheter-obtained specimen before treatment. Results of comparison of urine cultures obtained with these 2 collecting methods are presented. RESULTS: A total of 7. 5 % of bag-obtained specimen positive cultures had false-positive results. Twenty-nine percent of bag-obtained specimen cultures with negative results were false negative. Altogether, bag-obtained specimens led to either a misdiagnosis or an impossible diagnosis in 40 % of cases versus 5. 7 % when <b>urethral</b> catheterization was <b>used.</b> CONCLUSION: Every bag-obtained positive-result urinalysis should be confirmed with a more reliable method before therapy...|$|R
