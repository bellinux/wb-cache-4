2500|$|Sonar (originally {{an acronym}} for SOund Navigation And Ranging) is a {{technique}} that uses sound propagation (usually underwater, as in submarine navigation) to navigate, communicate with or detect objects on or {{under the surface of}} the water, such as other vessels.

Sonar may be used as a means of acoustic location and of measurement of the echo characteristics of [...] "targets" [...] in the water. Acoustic location in air was used before the introduction of radar. Sonar may also be used in air for robot navigation, and SODAR (an upward looking in-air sonar) is used for atmospheric investigations. The term sonar is also used for the equipment used to generate and receive the sound. The acoustic frequencies used in sonar systems vary from very low (infrasonic) to extremely high (ultrasonic). The study of underwater sound is known as <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustics</b> or hydroacoustics.|$|E
40|$|Because {{the forming}} {{mechanism}} of <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> signal is complex, {{it is difficult}} to establish the accurate predicting model.

Three types of ship radiated noise are taken as real <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> signal. First of all, a basic model framework is chosen. Secondly, each possible model is done with genetic coding. Thirdly, model evaluation standard is established. Fourthly, the operation of genetic algorithm such as crossover, reproduction, and mutation is designed.

30|$|Recently, {{underwater}} {{communication network}} has attracted the attention, {{which can be}} used in underwater environment monitoring and submarine resource exploration. The underwater communication network transmits data using the <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> channel [5]. However, there are often multiple different <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> systems in the same water area, which may cause the interference to each other. In order to improve the spectrum utilization, CR has been introduced in the underwater communication network, called as cognitive sonar communication networks (CSCN) [6]. CSCN can use the sonar nodes to detect the presence of the other <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> systems in the surrounding water environment and transmit data on the premise of detecting the idle <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> channel. The <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> environment in the ocean is very complex, and usually, multiple acoustic systems coexist in the same water area, such as artificial echolocation systems, monitoring systems, and the nature acoustic systems of marine mammals [7]. The spectrum sharing of artificial acoustic network system and natural acoustic system will affect the transmission efficiency and the survival of marine mammals. The CSCN can realize the coexistence of a variety of artificial <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> systems in the protection of marine animals [8].
