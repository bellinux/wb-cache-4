50|$|In {{conjunction}} with its Self-help Center, ILD {{has launched a}} blog on its website to keep merchants and consumers informed of its business activities. ILD has played {{an active role in}} leading the Bill to Phone industry with the establishment of guidelines for ecommerce transactions on a telephone bill. ILD’s blog http://www.ildteleservicesblog.com provides tips, alerts, and other information that helps merchants and consumers alike make more informed decisions, including ways to avoid cramming, advice from the FCC, and articles on what consumers can do to protect themselves against the threat of <b>unauthorized</b> <b>transaction</b> on their telephone bill. Though ILD processes over 120 million transactions each year for buyers and merchants—over a half of a billion dollars in purchases—only a small fraction result in disputes and chargebacks, much like credit cards. When there are disputes, ILD investigates these with its merchants and makes sure that credits are applied back to the phone bill, just like credit card company standards. ILD continually monitors complaint levels against the merchant who the bills through us, and if it finds a merchant in violation of ILD policies, it has and will terminate their billing agreement.|$|E

The account holders that are {{discussed in this article}} are not limited to individual consumers. This article also examines how an <b>unauthorized</b> <b>transaction</b> can be prevented and what this suggests about who should bear the loss of such a transaction. In doing so, this article looks at two moments at which an unauthorized payment transaction might be prevented: before the first <b>unauthorized</b> <b>transaction,</b> and after the first <b>unauthorized</b> <b>transaction.</b> This article examines five of the most common payment systemschecks, debit cards, ACH debits, wire transfers, and credit cards-and their general rules for allocating losses prior to and after execution of a payment transaction. The final section of this article considers recent developments in society and technology, notably the problems of Internet security and identity theft. This article asks whether the divergent approaches taken to the problem of unauthorized payment transactions should be unified.

40|$|International audienceContactless {{technology}} is a well explored area used in many different fields. However, the lack of security in the physical layer has recently delayed its use in many applications like payments. The permissiveness of this technology leads to threats such as the activation of a contactless card out of its operating range or the violation of the communication privacy between a reader and a transponder. Among the possible attacks, the relay attack is considered as the most dangerous. This attack creates <b>unauthorized</b> <b>transactions</b> between two contactless devices. For now, the current cryptographic algorithms {{are not able to}} circumvent it. In this paper, we develop two new designs of relays with introduced delays lower than 2 μs. By doing this, we demonstrate the requirements of countermeasures based on delay assessment. Finally, we propose a new protocol resistant to mafia and terrorist frauds and present experimental results to prove its reliability. Based on the HF physical layer properties, this solution authenticates the two communicating devices and uses correlation to measure delays. This new countermeasure, in accordance with contactless standards, detects relays with 300 ns accuracy which is enough to detect most of relay attacks...|$|R

40|$|Credit {{and debit}} cards, rather than actual money, {{have become the}} {{universal}} payment means. With these cards, it has become possible to buy expensive items easily without an additional complex authentication procedure being conducted. However, card transaction features are targeted by criminals seeking to use a lost or stolen card {{and looking for a}} chance to replicate it. Accidents, whether caused by the negligence of users or not, that lead to a transaction being performed by a criminal rather than the authorized card user should be prevented. Therefore, card companies are providing their clients with a variety of policies and standards to cover this eventuality. Card companies must therefore be able to distinguish between the rightful user and illegal users according to these standards in order to minimize damage resulting from <b>unauthorized</b> <b>transactions.</b> However, {{there is a limit to}} applying the same fixed standards to all card users, since the transaction patterns of people differ and even individuals' transaction patterns may change frequently due to changes income and consumption preference. Therefore, when only a specific threshold is applied, it is difficult to distinguish a fraudulent card transaction from a legitimate one. In this paper, we present methods for learning the individual patterns of a card user's transaction amount and the region in which he or she uses the card, for a given period, and for determining whether the specified transaction is allowable in accordance with these learned user transaction patterns. Then, we classify legitimate transactions and fraudulent transactions by setting thresholds based on the learned individual patterns...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Soft-products are {{intangible}} {{products such}} as software, music, video and phone cards whose delivery can be entirely completed over electronic means like the Internet; by entirely we mean that both the delivery and the consumption can be performed remotely and electronically over the Internet {{as opposed to a}} conventional face-to-face interaction. This particularity can be exploited by honest sellers and buyers to create a highly dynamic market; unfortunately, it can be exploited by dishonest individuals as well to commit a wide variety of frauds. In this paper, we argue that currently, most fraudsters exploit the vulnerability of the identity authentication methods that are used in most Internet shopping transactions and we propose a mechanism to address the problem. Our proposal is called trusted delivery and relies on the use of a trusted delivery party whose role is to uniquely identify and authenticate online customers, prevent <b>unauthorized</b> credit card <b>transactions,</b> and help in resolving potential disputes between the buyer and the seller...|$|R
