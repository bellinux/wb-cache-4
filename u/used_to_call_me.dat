My dad <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> after he'd had a few drinks and I wouldn't know what to say. I was {{speechless}} and I just feared that I would lose him and I wouldn't be there." ...|$|E

Not that I was heartbroken at that state of affairs, but it brought home to me the way some of those guys react." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2009, the British tabloid, the News of the World, {{revealed}} a video made by Harry {{three years earlier}} in which he referred to a Pakistani fellow officer cadet as [...] "our little Paki friend" [...] and called a soldier wearing a cloth on his head a [...] "raghead". These terms were described by then-Leader of the Opposition David Cameron as [...] "unacceptable", and by The Daily Telegraph as [...] "racist", with a British Muslim youth organisation calling Harry a [...] "thug". Clarence House immediately issued an apology from Harry, who stated that no malice was intended in his remarks. Former British MP and Royal Marine, Rod Richards, said that such nicknames were common amongst military comrades, stating [...] "in the Armed Forces people often <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Taffy. Others were called Yankie, Oz or Kiwi or whatever. I consider Paki as an abbreviation for Pakistani. I don't think on this occasion {{it was intended to}} be offensive." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{served a}} diligent {{seven years to}} it; to a master who grudged every hour to me that tended not to his profit, even of those times of leisure and diversion, which the {{refractoriness}} of my fellow-servants obliged him to allow them, and were usually allowed by other masters to their apprentices. I stole from the hours of rest and relaxation, my reading times for improvement of my mind; and, being engaged in correspondence with a gentleman, greatly my superior in degree, and of ample fortune, who, had he lived, intended high things for me; these were all the opportunities I had in my apprenticeship to carry it on. But this little incident I may mention; I took care that even my candle was of my own purchasing, that I might not, in the most trifling instance, make my master a sufferer (and who <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> the pillar of his house) and not to disable myself by watching or sitting-up, to perform my duty {{to him in the}} day time. - Samuel Richardson on his time with John Wilde.|$|R

2500|$|At this point, several {{witnesses}} {{later said}} they heard Harris and Klebold comment {{that they no}} longer found a thrill in shooting their victims. Klebold was quoted as saying, [...] "Maybe we should start knifing people, that might be more fun." [...] (Both youths were equipped with knives.) They moved away from the table and went toward the library's main counter. Harris threw a Molotov cocktail toward the southwestern end of the library, but it failed to explode. Harris went around {{the east side of the}} counter and Klebold joined him from the west; they converged close to where Todd had moved after having been wounded. Harris and Klebold mocked Todd, who was wearing a white hat. When the shooters demanded to see his face, Todd partly lifted his hat so his face would remain obscured. When Klebold asked Todd to give him one reason why he should not kill him, Todd said: [...] "I don't want trouble." [...] Klebold said, [...] "You [...] <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> a fag. Who's a fag now?!" [...] The shooters continued to taunt Todd and debated killing him, but they eventually walked away.|$|E

60|$|I {{lived with}} this strange old man for six weeks. I kept his books, {{and did what}} little I could to make myself useful: {{carrying}} about boots and shoes, as if I had never borne his Majesty's commission. He gave me no money, but he fed and lodged me comfortably. The men and boys <b>used</b> <b>to</b> laugh, and <b>call</b> <b>me</b> General, and Lord Cornwallis, {{and all sorts of}} nicknames; and old Stiffelkind made a thousand new ones for me.|$|R

The German Staff play tennis and the Austrians all go in for polo. Here comes Ziduski. He's most fearfully popular with the ladies here--does {{us a lot of}} harm, they say. He's a great sticker for etiquette. He <b>used</b> <b>to</b> nod and <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Phil. Now you watch. He'll bow from his waist, as though he had corsets on.

60|$|Being now in part {{removed from}} my old station, I {{seemed to be}} in a fair way of {{retiring}} from my old acquaintances, and consequently from the vile, abominable trade I had driven so long; so that the door seemed to be, as it were, particularly open to my reformation, if I had any mind to it in earnest; but, for all that, some of my old friends, as I had <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> them, inquired <b>me</b> out, and came to visit me at Kensington, and that more frequently than I wished they would do; but it being once known where I was, there was no avoiding it, unless I would have downright refused and affronted them; and I was not yet in earnest enough with my resolutions to go that length.|$|R
