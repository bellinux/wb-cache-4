At bedtime, Granpa tells Emily the story of The Three Knights, of which was imagined on a bed covers. Though as he reads, he begins to slow <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> begins to drop off. So he end it with his own version, just as Emily was finally going to sleep.|$|E
5|$|Within weeks Jan {{was sent}} from the {{familiar}} surroundings of Klipfontein to a boarding house at Riebeek West, {{to take his}} brother's place {{at the school of}} Mr TC Stoffberg. As had been the case with his brother, his parents had already mapped out his future; like his brother Jan was destined for a future in the Dutch Reformed Church, to be ordained as a predikant at the conclusion of his studies. This vocation, though imposed upon him by his parents, was by no means regarded as an imposition by Jan, growing <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had in an environment where adherence to the Church and piety of deeds counted for a good deal. This upbringing had turned twelve-year-old Jan into a deeply religious, serious-minded boy. Now, attending school for the first time, he faced a number of obstacles. Foremost amongst these was his rudimentary grasp of English, {{at a time when it}} was the main medium of instruction and crucial for any Afrikaner who wished to play a role in wider Cape society. Thanks to his mother's efforts. in this as well as in other subjects, he was better prepared than most children in similar circumstances, but nevertheless he was to start his schooling alongside children many years younger than himself with many years of study separating him from his contemporaries.|$|E
25|$|His career stalled as his {{professional}} relationship with Brian Clough deteriorated; Clough, it would appear, was {{disturbed by the}} rumours of Justin Fashanu's visits to gay nightclubs and bars. His goals and then confidence dried <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> failed {{to fit in with}} the playing and lifestyle demands of Clough, especially after Clough had discovered his homosexuality and barred him from training with the side.|$|E

25|$|On 18 August 1806 Lieutenant M'Culloch used Galateas barge {{to pursue}} a {{schooner}} several miles up a river near Puerto Cabello, Venezuela. The schooner resisted the boarding party until she lost her commandeer and a crew member, at which time she surrendered. She {{proved to be a}} Spanish privateer with three long 6 and 4-pounders, some swivel guns, and musketoons. M'Culloch blew her <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could not safely bring her out. He did return with the prisoners. Galatea suffered one man wounded in the affair.|$|E
25|$|Miller {{followed}} his Olympic {{success with the}} mediocre season, but still managed to finish Top 3 in three occasions. He was third at the city event in Munich, second to Didier Cuche at Kitzbuehel's downhill and third in super-G at Hinterstoder. He started World Championships in Garmisch-Partenkirchen with typical Bode-like fashion at super-G race. He was leading the field despite losing a pole midway through the course, however he lost his balance {{coming out of a}} bend at the bottom, slowed down and stood <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> crossed the finish line on 12th position.|$|E

25|$|Soon after Pickett and Fitzhugh Lee {{left for}} lunch, Colonel Munford saw the Union attack shaping <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{prepared}} {{to have his}} cavalry division defend the left flank against the attack. Munford sent several couriers to look for Pickett or Fitzhugh Lee to tell them of the impending attack {{but they could not}} be found. Captain Henry Lee of Fitzhugh Lee's staff also could not find them. Munford had his division dismount, and deployed it on the left of Ransom's refused line. Each Confederate unit commander prepared for the attack as best he could, not always in co-operation with each other.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the second}} and third planes were setting up for their attack. Tatum drove one of them off with gunfire, but the other pilot {{continued}} on toward the ship until a hail of gunfire caused him to lose control of his aircraft. He banked sharply to the right, passed by Tatums port side, and splashed about 100yards astern. Within seconds, his cautious comrade renewed his attack. He dove on the fast transport, barely missing the port wing of her bridge, and Tatums antiaircraft fire followed him <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> climbed, did a wing-over, and prepared to come in again. His third and final attack carried him across the ship's fantail and into the water about 50feet from her starboard quarter.|$|E
25|$|On 5 July 2014, {{he played}} for the Rest of the World XI against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's, {{as he had been}} left out of India's ODI team. Under Shane Warne's captaincy, he struck almost a-run-a-ball century to rescue his team who had been {{struggling}} at 59 for 3. His 100 came <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> hit Sachin Tendulkar for a boundary. Rest of the World finished on 293 for 7 after 50 overs, but MCC {{went on to win the}} match by 7 wickets. At the 2014–15 Ranji Trophy that followed the selection, Singh scored three centuries and finished with 671 runs in 7 matches with an average of 55.91. In September 2015, Yuvraj was named Vice-Captain of the Punjab Cricket Team.|$|E

25|$|However, {{aside from}} {{playing in a}} {{practice}} match, Azhar {{did not get a}} chance to participate in the World Cup and Pakistan's early exit from the tournament meant that he was once again, in line for being axed from the national squad. Following his exclusion, Azhar returned to playing county cricket in UK. Over the years, due to his constant exclusion from the Pakistani squad {{and the fact that he}} has crossed the 30-year-old mark, it seems that Mahmood is not as interested in returning to the Pakistani line <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> once was. His weight gain, mediocre performances in ODIs, combined with the tough competition for the all rounder slot in the Pakistani line up meant that his chances for making a return to the national squad were very limited. He has previously signed with the defunct Indian Cricket League (ICL) and had been released from his central contract.|$|E
25|$|However, Krause {{also made}} many picks {{that did not}} help the team. In 1986, Krause planned on {{selecting}} a tall forward named Brad Sellers in the NBA Draft. Sellers, Krause reasoned, was too good a pick to pass <b>up,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> handled the ball very well for a big man, and also had a solid outside jumper. Jordan, on the other hand, pushed management to take a two-way guard from Duke named Johnny Dawkins. It looked as though Krause would take Dawkins even {{as late as the}} morning of the draft; the coaches and players had {{made it clear that they}} wanted him and not Sellers, and Krause did not particularly have a problem with Dawkins' game. The Bulls' head coach at the time, Doug Collins, even told Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski the night before the draft that the team would pick Dawkins. However, Krause ignored everyone and picked Sellers anyway, and spent the summer trying to sell him to Jordan. Jordan went after Sellers mercilessly in practice, and Sellers was traded after three seasons. He played six total seasons in the NBA, averaging 6.3 points per game. Dawkins played for nine seasons in the NBA and averaged 11.1 points per game, though he did suffer from various injuries throughout his career.|$|E
25|$|Tony is then {{shocked when}} he discovers he has {{testicular}} cancer and tells Darren although refuses to tell Diane. Cindy later finds out about Tony's cancer. Sinead then {{gives birth to}} her baby Katy which Diane initially adopts although Sinead then wants the baby and moves in with drug-dealer Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson). Sinead then starts drug-dealing and is reported to social services. Tony accuses Diane of reporting Sinead and is furious with her. He then moves in with Cindy. Diane later finds out about Tony's cancer, however, and Tony and Diane then re-unite with Tony moving back in with Diane. In October 2013, Tony and Diane decide {{to go to the}} seaside the day that Tony will get the news about whether his cancer has cleared or not. Tony and Diane discover that they met when they were children at the same seaside they are at now. Diane suddenly goes in to labor and she is rushed to the hospital. Tony's phone frequently rings as he is about to be told the news about his cancer, although he refuses to pick <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> wants to see Diane give birth to their children first. Diane gives birth to a boy named Anthony (the name Diane knew Tony as when they met as children) and Dee Dee (the name Tony knew Diane as). After this, Tony picks up his phone and is thrilled when he is told that his cancer has been cleared.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the {{progress}} of the relief force had been slowed by several factors including flooding from the heavy rain, Viet Cong action, poor equipment, limited communications and an ambiguous command relationship between the armour and infantry. Although normally having a strength of 13 APCs, 3 Troop had been reduced to just seven, with the remainder undergoing maintenance, while many of those available suffered from mechanical problems and obsolete radios. As a consequence they were augmented by three vehicles from 2 Troop, although these lacked gun shields, leaving the crew commander exposed. Mounted in the carriers, 100 men from A Company 6 RAR departed Nui Dat under command of Mollison, with orders to relieve the pressure on D Company by attacking from the south and then to reinforce them and secure the area to allow the evacuation of the wounded. However, with there relatively few gaps in the Nui Dat perimeter wide enough for the APCs, Roberts was forced to take a circuitous route south-east through the base. On arrival he found the exit had moved due to road works being carried out by the engineers, and this resulted in further delay until an alternative was located. At 17:55, after finally clearing the wire, Roberts was ordered to send two APCs back for Townsend and to wait until he came <b>up,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> intended to accompany the carriers rather than move by helicopter. Detaching two APCs, Roberts ignored {{the second part of the}} order and the remainder of the troop proceeded, leaving Nui Dat at 18:00.|$|E

The formal royal household established around Edward was, at first, under Sir William Sidney, and later Sir Richard Page, stepfather of Edward Seymour's wife, Anne Stanhope. Henry demanded exacting standards of security and cleanliness in his son's household, stressing that Edward was [...] "this whole realm's most precious jewel". Visitors described the prince, who was lavishly provided with toys and comforts, including his own troupe of minstrels, as a contented child.|$|E

[...] Danko told Dylan biographer Howard Sounes, [...] "Bob and Robbie, they would come by every day, five to seven days a week, for seven to eight months." [...] Hudson added, [...] "It amazed me, Bob's writing ability. How he would come in, {{sit down at the}} typewriter, and write a song.
