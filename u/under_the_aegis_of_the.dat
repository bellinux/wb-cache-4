5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, Patchway came <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>aegis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western Region of British Railways. In 1949, there were 11 trains towards South Wales and 13 towards Bristol each weekday, with three trains {{per day in}} each direction on Sundays.

Traffic levels fell - the station was closed to goods traffic on 5 July 1965, and subsequently had all staff withdrawn on 14 October 1968. The goods loop was taken up and the station buildings demolished, replaced by small brick shelters. The structure of the footbridge remained, but the roof was removed. The goods yard was repurposed as vehicle storage.|$|E
5|$|In March 1933, {{less than}} three months after the Nazis seized power, Himmler set up the first {{official}} concentration camp at Dachau. Hitler had stated {{that he did not want}} it to be just another prison or detention camp. Himmler appointed Theodor Eicke, a convicted felon and ardent Nazi, to run the camp in June 1933. Eicke devised a system that was used as a model for future camps throughout Germany. Its features included isolation of victims from the outside world, elaborate roll calls and work details, the use of force and executions to exact obedience, and a strict disciplinary code for the guards. Uniforms were issued for prisoners and guards alike; the guards' uniforms had a special Totenkopf (death's head) insignia on their collars. By the end of 1934, Himmler took control of the camps <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>aegis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SS, creating a separate division, the SS-Totenkopfverbände.|$|E
5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, Pill came <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>aegis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western Region of British Railways. Passenger services had reduced by 1949 to 13 trains per day on weekdays and seven on Sundays. In 1963 the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services {{along the line}} as a cost-saving measure, and so goods services at Pill were ended on 10 June 1963; with the station closing completely on 7 September 1964. In {{the final year of}} operation, there were only six trains on weekdays and none on Sundays. Freight trains continued to pass through the station, but their number decreased over time, and the line fell out of regular use after 30 March 1981. The line however was kept intact by British Rail, with occasional freight trains, and in 2002 a single track was relaid to allow rail access to Royal Portbury Dock, which brought regular freight traffic. At this time remnants of both platforms could be seen and the station buildings were in commercial use.|$|E

5|$|In 1903, {{the station}} {{employed}} 11 men, but {{the post of}} station master was abolished on 27 August 1909 as a cost-cutting measure, with responsibility passing to Clifton Down. There were six staff by 1938. In 1923, grouping resulted in the Midland Railway being absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), and the line continued in a joint arrangement between the Great Western and the LMS. Services to Fishponds ended on 31 March 1941. When the railways were nationalised in 1948, when it came <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>aegis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western Region of British Railways.

Staff were withdrawn completely on 17 July 1967, a fate shared by most of the other stations on the Severn Beach Line. The southern running line was lifted on 19 October 1970, and the adjacent platform abandoned and its shelter demolished. The ticket office and footbridge were also demolished, with a replacement entrance opened through the South Road garages.|$|E
5|$|On 26 September 1957, Abu Nuwar, Rimawi and al-Hiyari {{were sentenced}} to 15 years {{imprisonment}} in absentia. During his exile from Jordan, Abu Nuwar initially resided in Damascus, along with other Jordanian dissidents, including al-Hiyari and Rimawi. However, in 1958, Abu Nuwar moved to Egypt following that country's union with Syria forming the United Arab Republic (UAR) under Nasser's presidency (Syria seceded in 1961). Thenceforth, Abu Nuwar lived much of {{the remainder of his}} exile in Cairo. In 1958, <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>aegis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UAR and with assistance from the head of Syrian intelligence, Abd al-Hamid al-Sarraj, the Jordanian dissidents in exile formed the Jordanian Revolutionary Council. It consisted of Jordanian Baathists, left-leaning politicians and dissident army officers, including Abu Nuwar, al-Hiyari and Abdullah al-Tal, a friend of Abu Nuwar who had been exiled by Hussein before him. The group attempted to recruit a university students in Jordan to form the vanguard of the nationalist movement in the country, funded the smuggling of weapons to Palestinian dissidents in the West Bank and the refugee camps around Amman, financially assisted Jordanian officers and politicians dismissed by Hussein, and organized assassination attempts against leading royalist politicians, including al-Rifai, Talhouni and Hazza al-Majali. There were disputes between al-Tal and Abu Nuwar over leadership of the group.|$|E
5|$|Until {{after the}} Thirty Years' War, the territories of Brandenburg-Prussia were {{politically}} independent from each other, connected {{only by the}} common feudal superior. Frederick William, who envisioned {{the transformation of the}} personal union into a real union, started to centralize the Brandenburg-Prussian government with an attempt to establish the Geheimer Rat as a central authority for all territories in 1651, but this project proved to be unfeasible. Instead, the elector continued to appoint a governor (Kurfürstlicher Rat) for each territory, who in most cases {{was a member of the}} Geheimer Rat. The most powerful institution in the territories remained the governments of the estates (Landständische Regierung, named Oberratsstube in Prussia and Geheime Landesregierung in Mark and Cleves), which were the highest government agencies regarding jurisdiction, finances and administration. The elector attempted to balance the estates' governments by creating Amtskammer chambers to administer and coordinate the elector's domains, tax income and privileges. Such chambers were introduced in Brandenburg in 1652, in Cleves and Mark in 1653, in Pomerania in 1654, in Prussia in 1661 and in Magdeburg in 1680. Also in 1680, the Kreditwerk came <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>aegis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elector.|$|E

5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, Clifton Bridge came <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>aegis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western Region of British Railways. Services had reduced by 1949 to 13 trains per day on weekdays and seven on Sundays, and passenger numbers fell. The station became an unstaffed halt from 29 October 1962, and in 1963, the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line. Passenger services at Clifton Bridge were ended on 7 September 1964, with goods services ending {{the next year}} on 5 July 1965. In {{the final year of}} passenger operation, there were only six trains on weekdays and none on Sundays. One of the carriage sidings had been taken out of service in 1964, and the others followed in 1966. The line through the site was reduced to single track in 1965, and the signal box was closed on 4 November 1966. The station buildings were mostly demolished, and the site became the headquarters of the Avon and Somerset Constabulary Mounted Police and Dog Section. Part of the western platform remained in situ, as did the retaining wall of the eastern platform shelter. The station footbridge became part of a footpath. Freight trains continued to pass through the station, but their number decreased over time, with the line falling out of regular use from 30 March 1981. The route however was kept intact by British Rail, with occasional freight trains, and in 2002 a single track was relaid to allow rail access to Royal Portbury Dock.|$|E
5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, services at Shirehampton came <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>aegis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western Region of British Railways. Staff levels decreased by 1958 to two clerks, two leading porters, one porter, and a stationmaster {{who was also}} responsible for Sea Mills railway station. Service levels had decreased slightly by 1955 to 28 towards Avonmouth and 29 towards Bristol, but the services were at regular intervals. Passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 {{as the result of}} a fare increase, and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted, which lost more passengers. A year later in 1963, the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line, but ultimately only those beyond Severn Beach or via Henbury were withdrawn. Goods services from the station ended on 29 November 1965, and from 17 July 1967 all staffing was withdrawn from stations along the line, including Shirehampton, with tickets issued by the train guard. An 800-ton oil storage tank was built in the station yard in 1967, with deliveries continuing until the mid-eighties. By 2005 the yard had been redeveloped and was occupied by a commercial vehicle hire company. The general reduction in passenger traffic, as well as the transfer of Avonmouth goods traffic to the Henbury Loop Line, allowed the removal of the second track from 19 October 1970, with all services using the original, northern platform. The signal box was taken out of service at the same time, and the buildings on the remaining platform sold off before being destroyed by a fire in the 1990s. The station master's house is now a private dwelling, with the garden containing a small brick building with a chimney surviving from the station buildings. By 1974, service had reduced to 19 trains per day in each direction, with no Sunday services beyond Avonmouth.|$|E
