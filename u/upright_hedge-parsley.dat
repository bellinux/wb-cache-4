50|$|Torilis japonica, the erect hedgeparsley, <b>upright</b> <b>hedge-parsley</b> or Japanese hedge parsley, is a {{plant species}} in the genus Torilis. Japanese Hedgeparsley is {{considered}} both an annual and biennial plant in the carrot family depending on the biogeographical location. This means Japanese Hedgeparsley can complete its life cycle in either one or two growing seasons depending on habitat. Japanese Hedgeparsley is typically found in areas with disturbed soils, pastures, margins, open woodland, near waste sites, or right-of-way habitats. It can withstand a variety of habitats, thriving in partial and full shaded areas, but also withstanding habitats with full sunlight penetration. It is considered an aggressive invasive species in North America; invading {{a wide range of}} habitats due to its environmental tolerance and tendency to outcompete native vegetation. This species is considered a threat in several areas that causes problems relating to overall environmental health and stability. Aside from its environmental implications, T. japonica has potential to fight several cancers through a terpene it produces called Torilin, extracted from its fruits.|$|E
