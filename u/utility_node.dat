30|$|The Bayesian Network model {{structure}} is also {{dependent on the}} type of nodes involved in it. Three commonly used BN nodes are the Nature node, <b>Utility</b> <b>node</b> and Decision node (Ticehurst et al. 2007). The nature node describes possible states of a variable and the probability of each state. This type of node could be qualitative or quantitative (discrete or continuous). A <b>utility</b> <b>node</b> is a continuous variable describing the desirability of the consequences of a set of outcomes. The decision node represents a controllable variable providing choice to the decision maker (Robertson 2004).|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} use the BN for decision-making, we {{extended}} it to an influence diagram. We added the decision node System Action, representing all actions the display could choose to react on context changes and a <b>Utility</b> <b>node</b> that encodes the utilities of all these actions to maintain the user’s trust. As an example, let us assume a user wishes to display data on a public display while other people are present. Such a situation could be described by {{the values of the}} BN’s nodes Social Context and Privacy of Content. These have been determined by sensors or application data and are thus known by the system. The system may now consider three options to cope with the user’s request: (1) transferring all data to the public display no matter whether they are private or not, (2) show only the information marked as non-private or (3) asking the user for a confirmation of one of these actions. Considering the example, option (1) may result in serious privacy concerns, option (2) may confuse the users if there is no plausible explanation for the adaptation, and option (3) could be less comfortable to use in a dynamic setting, such as the prototype settings described in this paper. Furthermore, if the system decides in favor of option (1) or (2), the users might perceive the system as less controllable. The arcs between the decision node and the nodes for the five dimensions of trust represent such influences. To choose the adaptation that is most useful for the system in a specific situation, the <b>Utility</b> <b>node</b> computes the utility of all possible actions and their consequences and returns the action with the highest utility. Since the goal of our work is to maintain and maximize user trust, the <b>Utility</b> <b>node</b> is attached to a node representing the User Trust and measures the utility of each single decision in terms of the resulting user trust - a combination of Initial Trust and Interaction-Based Trust.|$|E
40|$|Summary: Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) {{involves}} {{the selection of}} the best actions from a set of alternatives, each of which is evaluated against multiple, and often conflicting, criteria. Most of the existing MCDM methods only focus on decisions under certainty. The criteria were evaluated separately as if they were independent of each other. Complex, often uncertain interactions between criteria, and between criteria and other factors are not modeled in a coherent and systematic manner. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a decision framework based on Bayesian networks (BN) and influence diagram (ID) to structure and manage MCDM problems with explicit modeling of uncertain interactions among entities of interest. In this framework, a decision problem is represented by an ID where each decision node represents the set of alternatives for a decision, a <b>utility</b> <b>node</b> represents the set of objectives (decision maker’s preferences), decision criteria and internal or external factors that may affect the criteria are represented by chance nodes. Interdependencies among these nodes are qualitatively modeled by the links in the diagram and quantitatively by conditional probability tables (CPT) associated with each of the chance nodes and the <b>utility</b> <b>node.</b> The joint probability distribution, which is compactly captured by the network structure and CPT, encodes the domain expert’s knowledge of interdependency between variables.

40|$|A Bayesian network {{methodology}} {{is developed}} for performing infrastructure seismic risk assessment and providing decision support {{with an emphasis}} on immediate post-earthquake applications. The methodology consists of four major components: (1) a seismic demand model of ground motion intensity as a spatially distributed Gaussian random field accounting for multiple seismic sources with uncertain characteristics and including finite fault rupture and directivity effects; (2) a model of the performance of point-site and distributed components under seismic loading; (3) models of system performance as a function of component states; and (4) the extension of the Bayesian network to include decision and <b>utility</b> <b>nodes</b> to aid post-earthquake decision-making. A Bayesian network is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their probabilistic dependencies. The variables may represent demand or capacity values, or the states of components and systems. Bayesian networks are graphical and intuitive, facilitate information updating, can be used for identification of critical components within a system, and can be extended by decision and <b>utility</b> <b>nodes</b> to solve decision problems. The facility for information updating renders the Bayesian network an ideal tool for infrastructure seismic risk assessment and decision support, particularly in near-real time applications immediately following a destructive earthquake. Evidence on one or more variables (e. g. observed component capacities, demands, or damage states) can be entered into the Bayesian network and this information propagates throughout the network to provide an up-to-date probabilistic characterization of the performance of the infrastructure system under the uncertain and evolving state of information that is characteristic of the post-event period. Like most computational methods, Bayesian networks have limitations. In particular, calculations in Bayesian networks can be highly demanding of computer memory. The present study develops methodologies to minimize computational demands by optimizing network topology and, when necessary, making trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency. The study begins with a brief introduction to Bayesian networks. Next, each of the aforementioned components of the methodology is described. The seismic demand model provides distributions of ground motion intensity at discrete points in the geographic domain of a spatially distributed infrastructure system. This model can be used to perform and go beyond conventional probabilistic seismic hazard assessment. In particular, the model provides a full random field characterization of the ground motion intensity, thus allowing assessment of seismic risk for spatially distributed systems. Equally important, the model enables updating of the distribution of intensity at any selected site upon observation of the intensity at other sites. The modeling of random fields via Bayesian network results in a densely connected topology that renders probabilistic inference computationally demanding and possibly intractable. To address this problem, several approaches for approximating the correlation structure of variables drawn from a random field are developed, which amount to selectively removing links and nodes in the Bayesian network. It is found that a method based on numerical optimization achieves the best trade-off of accuracy versus efficiency. Bayesian network formulations are presented for modeling component performance as a function of seismic demand using fragility functions. The framework accounts for potential sources of correlation in component response. Models for point-site and distributed components are presented. The latter is based on an assumption that damages along a component occur according to a non-homogenous Poisson process. Five Bayesian network formulations for modeling system performance as a function of component states are developed. One approach uses a naïve topology, two formulations are based on an intuitive interpretation of system performance, and two approaches utilize minimal link and cut sets. The last two formulations are then adapted and refined with the goal of minimizing computational demands by arranging nodes in chain-like structures that reduce the size of conditional probability tables and, consequently, required computation time and memory. The Bayesian network is extended by decision and <b>utility</b> <b>nodes</b> to create a new graphical construct known as an influence diagram. This diagram aids decision-making by specifying decision alternatives that maximize expected utility given all available evidence. The extension of the framework to include decision and <b>utility</b> <b>nodes</b> is demonstrated by application to a post-earthquake decision scenario involving inspection and shutdown decisions. A limited memory influence diagram is constructed to model this decision problem. A heuristic based on a value of information criterion is described for prioritizing component inspections following an earthquake. Two example applications demonstrate the Bayesian network methodology for infrastructure seismic risk assessment and decision support. The second example employs a preliminary and hypothetical model of the proposed California high speed rail system...|$|R

In particular, {{we focus on the}} influence diagram as a tool for reasoning and supporting decision-makers under conditions of risk and uncertainty. This powerful modelling tool can help to bridge multiple specialist domains and provide a common framework for supporting decision-makers in different agencies. An influence diagram is also referred to as a decision network and can be considered as an extension of a Bayesian network. Like a Bayesian network, it contains chance nodes which represent random variables and deterministic nodes which represent deterministic functions of input variables. However, in addition, an influence diagram contains decision nodes which represent decisions under local control and <b>utility</b> <b>nodes</b> which can represent a variety of costs and benefits. These might be measured in several dimensions including casualties and monetary units. Advantages of Bayesian networks and influence diagrams over more traditional risk and safety modelling approaches such as event trees and fault trees are discussed - in particular, the ease with which they represent dependencies between many factors and the different types of reasoning supported at the same time, e. g. predictive reasoning and diagnostic reasoning. An illustrative, generic influence diagram is presented of a situation corresponding to a CBRNE attack. We then consider how this generic model can be applied to a more specific scenario such as an attack at a sporting event. A variety of potential uses of the model are identified and discussed, along with problems which are likely to be encountered in model development. We argue that this modelling approach provides a useful framework to support cost-effectiveness studies and high-level trade-offs between alternative possible security measures and other resources impacting on response and recovery operations.
