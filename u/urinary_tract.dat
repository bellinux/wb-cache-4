5|$|A <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> {{infection}} (UTI) is {{an infection}} that affects {{part of the}} <b>urinary</b> <b>tract.</b> When it affects the lower <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> it {{is known as a}} bladder infection (cystitis) and when it affects the upper <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> it is known as kidney infection (pyelonephritis). Symptoms from a lower <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> include pain with urination, frequent urination, and feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty bladder. Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and flank pain usually in addition to the symptoms of a lower UTI. Rarely the urine may appear bloody. In the very old and the very young, symptoms may be vague or non-specific.|$|E
5|$|About 150 {{million people}} {{developed}} a <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> infection each year. They {{are more common}} in women than men. In women, {{they are the most}} common form of bacterial infection. Up to 10% of women have a <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> infection in a given year and half of women having at least one infection at some point in their lives. They occur most frequently between the ages of 16 and 35years. Recurrences are common. <b>Urinary</b> <b>tract</b> infections have been described since ancient times with the first documented description in the Ebers Papyrus dated to c. 1550 BC.|$|E
5|$|Uropathogenic E. coli {{from the}} gut {{is the cause}} of 80–85% of community-acquired <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> infections, with Staphylococcus saprophyticus being the cause in 5–10%. Rarely they may be due to viral or fungal infections. Healthcare-associated <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> infections (mostly related to urinary catheterization) involve a much broader range of {{pathogens}} including: E. coli (27%), Klebsiella (11%), Pseudomonas (11%), the fungal pathogen Candida albicans (9%), and Enterococcus (7%) among others. <b>Urinary</b> <b>tract</b> infections due to Staphylococcus aureus typically occur secondary to blood-borne infections. Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium can infect the urethra but not the bladder. These infections are usually classified as a urethritis rather than <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> infection.|$|E

5|$|Chronic {{prostatitis}} in {{the forms}} of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome and chronic bacterial prostatitis (not acute bacterial prostatitis or asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis) may cause recurrent <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> infections in males. Risk of infections increases as males age. While bacteria is commonly present in the urine of older males this {{does not appear to}} affect the risk of <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> infections.|$|E
5|$|<b>Urinary</b> <b>tract</b> infections {{may affect}} 10% of people during childhood. Among {{children}} <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> infections {{are the most}} common in uncircumcised males less than three months of age, followed by females less than one year. Estimates of frequency among children however vary widely. In a group of children with a fever, ranging in age between birth and two years, two to 20% were diagnosed with a UTI.|$|E
5|$|Women {{are more}} prone to UTIs than men because, in females, the urethra is much shorter and closer to the anus. As a woman's {{estrogen}} levels decrease with menopause, her risk of <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> infections increases due to the loss of protective vaginal flora. Additionally, vaginal atrophy that can sometimes occur after menopause is associated with recurrent <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> infections.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{measures}} {{have not been}} confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of underwear used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating, or whether a person typically bathes or showers. There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, tampon use, and douching. In those with frequent <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm {{as a method of}} contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods. In those with benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder emptying which might decrease <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> infections in this group.|$|E

There has been substantiated the necessity for the priority usage of percutaneuos nephrostomy as an accessible, minimally invasive, with minimal number of complications and most importantly the low level of fatal outcomes (2. 7 %) of method of treatment for patients with full obstruction in the upper <b>urinary</b> <b>tracts</b> and renal failure...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} goal is {{to study}} functional condition of upper and lower <b>urinary</b> <b>tracts</b> at fetus with obstructive uropathy and development of differential diagnostic and prognostic criteria of transition of functional disorders to organic. The diagnosis of prenatal and verified postnatal obstructive uropathy at 42 fetuses has been made by prenatal ultrasonic cystometry. Process of filling and evacuation of bladder has been under study. Obtained data have been compared {{with the results of}} dynamic measurement of kidney sizes in a standard projection. According to the results only at 19, 1 % of cases statistically significant urodynamic differences have not been revealed in comparison with control group. Diagnostic accuracy of organic form of urodynamic obstructions is 84 %, of functional in 64, 7 % of observations and in 52, 9 % of cases the infection of <b>urinary</b> <b>tracts</b> with incomplete evacuation of bladder has been diagnosed. The degree of kidney and ureter expansion is not a differential diagnostic criterion of organic or functional urodynamic obstructions.

5|$|Other {{potential}} {{causes of}} {{signs and symptoms}} that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis {{that need to be}} ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> infections, and diabetes mellitus. Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered. The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).|$|E
5|$|People with SCI are at {{especially}} {{high risk for}} respiratory and cardiovascular problems, so hospital staff must be watchful to avoid them. Respiratory problems (especially pneumonia) are {{the leading cause of}} death in people with SCI, followed by infections, usually of pressure sores, <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> infections and respiratory infections. Pneumonia can be accompanied by shortness of breath, fever, and anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Persons with {{spinal cord}} injury are at {{increased}} risk for <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> infection in part because of chronic use of catheter, and in part because of voiding dysfunction. It is {{the most common cause of}} infection in this population, as well as the most common cause of hospitalization. Additionally, use of cranberry juice or cranberry supplement appears to be ineffective in prevention and treatment in this population.|$|E

5|$|The {{evidence}} that preventive antibiotics decrease <b>urinary</b> <b>tract</b> infections in children is poor.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{significant}} prevalence of chronic pyelonephritis, a life-time diagnosis {{has been established in}} only 15 – 30 % of patients. This is related to the asymptomatic and unclear clinical expression of the disease. In a significant number of patients, chronic pyelonephritis develops due to the presence of factors, which disrupt the passage of urine in the upper <b>urinary</b> <b>tracts</b> (Kidney stones and ureterolithiasis, constriction/narrowing of the upper <b>urinary</b> <b>tracts,</b> chronic urine retention in the urinary bladder etc.). In a third (1 / 3) of chronic pyelonephritic patients, the disease develops as a sub-acute non-specific inflammation of the parenchyma of the kidneys as well as the pelvicalyceal system (renal collecting system), and as a rule, starting from childhood age. In most cases of such patients, the disease is detected many years later after it started. When you are citing the document, use the following link [URL]...|$|R
