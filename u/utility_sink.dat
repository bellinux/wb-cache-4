50|$|Sewer gas is {{typically}} restricted from entering buildings through plumbing traps {{that create a}} water seal at potential points of entry. In addition, plumbing vents allow sewer gases to be exhausted outdoors. Infrequently used plumbing fixtures may allow sewer gas to enter a home due to evaporation {{of water in the}} trap, especially in dry weather. The result is the most common means of sewer gas entering buildings and can be solved easily by using the fixtures regularly or adding water to their drains. One of the most common traps to dry out are floor drains such as those typically placed near home furnaces and water heaters. Infrequently used <b>utility</b> <b>sinks,</b> tubs, showers, and restrooms also are common culprits. Trap primers are available that automatically add water to remote or little used traps such as these. Blocked plumbing vents, typically at the roof, also can cause water seals to fail via siphoning of the water.|$|R

Hygiene standards and easy washability are important features. The main focus was to make different types of accessories look similar and compact and to make them organize bathroom <b>utilities</b> near the <b>sink.</b> Variability of usage in the bathrooms of all types is possible due to plastic materials of different colours.

In this paper, formulate the problem of data transport in sensor networks as an optimization problem whose objective function is to maximize {{the amount of information}} (<b>utility)</b> collected at <b>sinks</b> (subscribers), subject to the flow, energy and channel bandwidth constraints. Also, based on a Markov model extended from [3], we derive the link delay and the node capacity in both the single and multi-hop environments, and figure them in the problem formulation. We study three special cases under the problem formulation. In particular, we consider the energy-aware flow control problem, derive an energy aware flow control solution, and investigate via ns- 2 simulation its performance. The simulation results show that the proposed energy-aware flow control solution can achieve high utility and low delay without congesting the network. 1...|$|R
40|$|Although woody {{ecosystems}} {{provide a}} key carbon sink {{to compensate for}} current and future greenhouse gas emissions, the potential <b>utility</b> of such <b>sinks</b> within agroecosystems {{has not yet been}} fully investigated. We quantified shelterbelt carbon variability, within above- and below-ground pools, for two contrasting farms: a conventional dairy farm and an organic mixed-cropping farm. Shelterbelts comprised deciduous, evergreen and mixed-native species occurring on silt loams, as well as adjacent paddock soils for comparison. Considering all above- and below-ground components, woody shelterbelts contained up to fifteen times more carbon (> 600 t C ha- 1) than sampled paddock soils (c. 45 t C ha- 1). Carbon quantities within organic farm shelterbelt soils were 2. 5 times higher than dairy farm soils, suggesting a potential land use effect. Soil carbon comprised about 10 % of total ecosystem carbon within shelterbelts. This study indicates that farm shelterbelts can serve a role as relevant carbon sinks within New Zealand agroecosystems...|$|R

30|$|While LEDs {{can provide}} {{superior}} optical performances at low energy consumptions, they pose significant thermal challenges due to inherit solid-state device technology based on light-generating active layers. Interest in passive cooling of high power LED lamps is increasing {{with the high}} luminosity demand though their bulky size and weight. Metal based heat sinks are widely used passive cooling components {{for the last few}} decades since the cooling of electronics started to become a major challenge for engineers. Besides the simplicity of fabrication without the requirement of a high-tech manufacturing facility, mature industrial <b>utilities</b> keep heat <b>sink</b> production low priced on this long-experienced field. This was also driven by the electronics industry while the performance has been increasing, size and cost has been shrinking. Heat sink requirements are changing by the cooling needs of different electronics with their various size, weight and operational standards. Heat sinks used in LED lamps are not only cooling the system but also help to assemble electronics and optical components. Complex task of a heat sink design includes also the aesthetic side like thermal, optical and mechanical aspects to address the user’s expectations to replace conventional lighting technologies.|$|R

40|$|The {{horizontal}} transmission of Clostridium difficile {{in the hospital}} environment is difficult to establish. Current methods to detect C. difficile spores on surfaces are not quantitative, lack sensitivity, and are protracted. We propose a novel rapid method to detect and quantify C. difficile contamination on surfaces. Sponge swabbing was compared to contact plate sampling to assess the in vitro recovery of C. difficile ribotype 027 contamination (100, 101, or 102 CFU of spores) from test surfaces (a bed rail, a stainless steel sheet, or a polypropylene work surface). Sponge swab contents were concentrated by vacuum filtration, and the filter membrane was plated onto selective agar. The efficacy of each technique for the recovery of C. difficile from sites in the clinical environment that are touched at a high frequency was evaluated. Contact plates recovered 19 to 32 % of the total contam-ination on test surfaces, whereas sponge swabs recovered 76 to 94 % of the total contamination, and contact plates failed to detect C. difficile contamination below a detection limit of 10 CFU/ 25 cm 2 (0. 4 CFU/cm 2). In use, contact plates failed to detect C. diffi-cile contamination (0 / 96 contact plates; 4 case wards), while sponge swabs recovered C. difficile from 29 % (87 / 301) of the sur-faces tested in the clinical environment. Approximately 74 % (36 / 49) of {{the area in the}} vicinity of the patient was contaminated (1. 34 6. 88 CFU/cm 2 C. difficile spores). Reservoirs of C. difficile extended to beyond the areas near the patient: a dirty <b>utility</b> room <b>sink</b> (2. 26 5. 90 CFU/cm 2), toilet floor (1. 87 2. 40 CFU/cm 2), and chair arm (1. 33 4. 69 CFU/cm 2). C. difficile was pres-ent on floors in 90 % of case wards. This study highlights that sampling with a contact plate may fail to detect C. difficile con-tamination and result in false-negative reporting. Our sponge sampling technique permitted the rapid and quantitative mea...|$|R
40|$|Distinct from {{wireless}} ad hoc networks, wireless sensor {{networks are}} data-centric, application-oriented, collaborative, and resource-constrained in nature. Especially, the limited resources on energy, bandwidth and computation capability radically change the considerations of system design. In this thesis we propose a comprehensive framework of data-centric information processing and dissemination to realize the general mission for sensor networks, to extract useful information from the environment to users. Two main research issues are investigated in this thesis: (T 1) coordination of sensors to generate valuable information from the sensed data and (T 2) efficient dissemination methods to deliver the information of the best quality from sensors to subscribers. As to the first issue, we propose a self-organized, dynamic clustering approach for the target tracking system. Coordination between sensors is triggered {{by the events of}} interests and a cluster consisting of a leader and several sensors is formed dynamically. Through the probabilistic leader volunteering procedure and sensors replying method based on the quality of data, the proposed dynamic clustering algorithm effectively eliminates contention among sensors and renders more accurate estimates of target locations. Regarding the second issue, data dissemination consists of the problems of routing and transport layers. The problem of data transport in this thesis is formulated as a utility-based optimization problem, with the objective of maximizing the amount of information (<b>utility)</b> collected at <b>sinks</b> (subscribers), subject to both the channel bandwidth and energy constraints. Both the centralized and distributed approaches are devised to solve the optimization problem. To validate the design and to empirically study the performance of the proposed works, we implement a subset of the proposed works on the Motes testbed, including both the acoustic tracking system and the utility-based data transport components...|$|R
40|$|The U 1 H Shaft Project is {{a design}} build {{subcontract}} {{to supply the}} U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) a 1, 045 ft. deep, 20 ft. diameter, concrete lined shaft for unspecified purposes. The subcontract awarded to Atkinson Construction by Bechtel Nevada to design and construct the shaft for the DOE has been split into phases with portions of the work being released as dictated by available funding. The first portion released included the design for the shaft, permanent hoist, headframe, and collar arrangement. The second release consisted of constructing the shaft collar {{to a depth of}} 110 ft., the service entry, utility trenches, and installation of the temporary sinking plant. The temporary sinking plant included the installation of the sinking headframe, the sinking hoist, two deck winches, the shaft form, the sinking work deck, and temporary <b>utilities</b> required to <b>sink</b> the shaft. Both the design and collar construction were completed on schedule. The third release consisted of excavating and lining the shaft to the station depth of approximately 950 feet. Work is currently proceeding on this production sinking phase. At a depth of approximately 600 feet, Atkinson has surpassed production expectation and is more than 3 months ahead of schedule. Atkinson has employed the use of a Bobcat 331 excavator as the primary means of excavation. the shaft is being excavated entirely in an alluvial deposit with varying degrees of calcium carbonate cementation. Several more work packages are expected to be released in the near future. The remaining work packages include, construction of the shaft station a depth of 975 ft. and construction of the shaft sump to a depth of 1, 045 ft., installation of the loading pocket and station steel and equipment, installation of the shaft steel and guides, installation of the shaft utilities, and installation of the permanent headframe, hoist, collar utilities, and facilities...|$|R
