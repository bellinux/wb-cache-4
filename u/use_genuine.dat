The signature is divided into zones using both the Cartesian and polar coordinate systems and two different histogram features are calculated for each zone: histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and histogram of local binary patterns (LBP). The classification is performed using Support Vector Machines (SVMs), where two different approaches for training are investigated, namely global and user-dependent SVMs. User-dependent SVMs, trained separately for each user, learn to differentiate a userâ€™s signature from others, whereas a single global SVM trained with difference vectors of query and reference signaturesâ€™ features of all users, learns how to weight dissimilarities. The global SVM classifier is trained <b>using</b> <b>genuine</b> and forgery signatures of subjects that are excluded from the test set, while userdependent SVMs are separately trained for each subject <b>using</b> <b>genuine</b> and random forgeries.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} a wavelet-based estimator for the estimation of the Hurst parameter used in characterizing self-similar network traffic. We <b>use</b> <b>genuine</b> traffic traces and simulation tools to investigate the impact of shortrange dependence on the accuracy of the estimated parameter. We briefly address the implication of our findings on traffic engineering. Our main conclusion is that this wavelet-based estimator can be used to analyze aggregated traffic data. Nevertheless, the estimator proves to be unsuitable for the medium- and high-bursty video traffic because of the traffic's complex correlation structure. 1 Introduction Recent studies based on high quality traffic measurements in various packet networks have shown that traffic processes exhibit self-similarity, i. e., long-range dependence (LRD) [2, 7, 9]. It is commonly accepted that the definition of LRD is the slow power-law decrease of the autocorrelation function of a wide-sensestationary process [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} {{activities in the}} area of network traffic have demonstrated that traffic patterns in modern networks are statistically different from patterns generated by traditional traffic models. These new traffic patterns are long-range dependent. Researchers have shown that long-range dependency has considerable impacts on queueing performance, and that it is becoming a predominant factor in solving a number of packet traffic engineering problems. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate traffic patterns in wireless data networks. By performing measurements, simulations, and analysis, our results demonstrate that wireless data traffic exhibits long-range dependent behavior, and, therefore, is statistically different from patterns generated by traditional traffic models. To evaluate the performance of wireless Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) networks, we use Opnet tool to simulate the Telus (formerly BCTel) CDPD network.

40|$|Automatic {{biometric}} static {{signature verification}} performs {{a comparison between}} signature images (or preformed templates) to verify authenticity. Although widely recognised that performance enhancement can be achieved when using dynamic features, which use temporal/ constructional information, alongside static features, this scenario requires the capture of signatures using specialist sample equipment such a tablet device. The vast majority of (legacy) signatures {{across a range of}} important domains, including banking, legal and forensic applications, are in a static format. In this paper we use the Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) image registration technique in a novel application to static signature image matching. We <b>use</b> <b>genuine</b> and skilled forgery signatures from the GPDS 960 dataset as test data and across a range of enrolment and SURF point distance configurations.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} cognitive content biases in cultural transmission. The concept of cognitive content biases suggests that humans preferentially attend to, recall and transmit certain types of information over others, and that this bias influences the transmission and evolution of cultural artefacts. A number of studies are presented which primarily <b>use</b> <b>genuine</b> urban legends as material. In using â€˜real worldâ€™ material such as urban legends these studies expand our knowledge of how content biases operate and {{shed light on the}} cultural success of these legends. Methodology included qualitative analyses, experiments using participants in linear transmission chains and computational phylogenetic techniques. The studies demonstrate that content biases are an effective force in cultural transmission but that different biases may not necessarily operate in exactly the same manner. It is argued that the cultural success of urban legends can be explained by their exploitation of cognitive content biases. The studies also demonstrate the efficacy of using â€˜real-worldâ€™ material such as urban legends in the examination of the mechanisms of cultural transmission and evolution...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Industrial economicsStochastic {{models of}} {{commodity}} prices play an integral {{role in the}} risk management of companies exposed to commodity price risk. By applying price models, one can obtain expected values for the future prices of the commodity, and also {{a measure of the}} uncertainty related to the future price. These figures are crucial for risk management, for example in assessing the need for price hedging. In this thesis, we propose a model for the price development of two correlated products. The model can be used for forecasting future prices for two correlated products simultaneously, and hence it also allows us to simulate the price spread between the products. The model can be a useful tool for companies seeking to hedge price spread risk, or for investors seeking to speculate on the price spread. Providing a real-life example from the oil market, we will <b>use</b> <b>genuine</b> data from Brent and WTI futures trading. This thesis utilizes the Schwartz and Smith (2000) model as a basis for developing the model for two correlated products. Also, a three-factor model is proposed in order to describe observed price data more precisely...|$|E
