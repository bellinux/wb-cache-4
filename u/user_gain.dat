By default, processes {{started by}} a regular <b>user</b> <b>gain</b> a Medium IL and elevated processes have High IL. By introducing integrity levels, MIC allows classes of applications to be isolated, enabling scenarios like sandboxing potentially-vulnerable applications (such as Internet-facing applications). Processes with Low IL are called low-integrity processes, which have less access than processes with higher ILs where the Access control enforcement is in Windows.|$|E

5000|$|Microsoft Starting with Windows Vista and Server 2008 Windows {{incorporates}} Mandatory Integrity Control, {{which adds}} Integrity Levels (IL) to processes {{running in a}} login session. MIC restricts the access permissions of applications that are running under the same user account and which may be less trustworthy. Five integrity levels are defined: Low, Medium, High, System, and Trusted Installer. Processes started by a regular <b>user</b> <b>gain</b> a Medium IL; elevated processes have High IL. While processes inherit the integrity level of the process that spawned it, the integrity level can be customized on a per-process basis: e.g. IE7 and downloaded executables run with Low IL. Windows controls access to objects based on ILs, {{as well as for}} defining the boundary for window messages via User Interface Privilege Isolation. Named objects, including files, registry keys or other processes and threads, have an entry in the ACL governing access to them that defines the minimum IL of the process that can use the object. MIC enforces that a process can write to or delete an object only when its IL is equal to or higher than the object’s IL. Furthermore, to prevent access to sensitive data in memory, processes can’t open processes with a higher IL for read access.|$|E

40|$|Present mobile {{satellite}} communication systems use large antennas to provide multiple high-gain beams. Each beam covers a fixed geographic cell on the earth. Spatial frequency reuse {{is provided by}} synthesising beams with low-power levels over all cells operating at the same frequency. The performance needs for future systems are steadily increasing, leading to higher-gain requirements, which are met by using larger antennas with narrower beams. So the antenna pointing errors become a significant loss factor. An alternative approach is to abandon the use of fixed beams and dynamically synthesise the beams to optimise the antenna performance in real time. This both increases <b>user</b> <b>gain</b> and lowers cofrequency interference whilst also reducing the effects of pointing errors. Simulations, using the Inmarsat 4 antenna architecture as a test example, show that the spatial isolation performance can be significantly improved by using Dynamic Beam Synthesis...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a new way}} to {{use computers}} in determining geographic regionalizations for the purposes of creating descriptive maps. A program for computer aided regionalization is described.

An adaptation of the frame-rectangle symbol, called a "multiple-frame" symbol, is used to communicate the attribute values of areas and the statistical properties of regions. The chief advantages of this approach are that it is flexible, it increases the user's awareness of the data, and it assists in the labeling of regions.

30|$|Note {{that while}} service {{providers}} of centralized OSNs typically {{have access to}} personal data that is generated in user-related activities, this section discusses only data that originates from the service usage. Drawing on user activities identified in Figure 3, several service provider-related activities can be identified. In the following, data emerging from these activities is classified into three separate data types. To assess the privacy impact of service provider-related data types in general, it is valuable to recall that privacy is a social concept. In more detail, privacy is breached if other people that {{have a relationship with}} the <b>user</b> <b>gain</b> access to this data. For service providers, in contrast, such a relationship does commonly not exist. Moreover, data is typically processed by machines and algorithms without human interaction. Nevertheless, in the longer run, the data types which are subsequently discussed may lead to social privacy implications. For instance, if such data becomes publicly available (e.g., through data breaches), people that do have a relation with the user can use this data to gain more knowledge and thereby invade his privacy. Consequently, protection is necessary and therefore discussed for each of the service provider-related data types.|$|E

A broad description is provided which traces the generation of MBA commands by the Communications Configuration Program (CCP) through the transmission of the command data to the spacecraft and its subsequent command verification by means of telemetry data using portions of the real-time Telemetry and Command Program (TCP). A detailed description is provided of the related portions of the TCP and the CCP which are utilized to analyze requirements and generate control information for the two nineteen beam transmit MBA's and the sixty-one beam receive MBA. CCP is the key element which provides the operator the capability to merge the requirements of the user community and the MBA characteristics to provide an optimal <b>user</b> <b>gain</b> distribution. Block diagrams are employed to depict the data flow through the DSCS system and the interaction of the operator with the software. Samples of the graphic display capability of the CCP software are included to demonstrate the flexibility afforded the operator as an analysis tool for operations planning. Comparison of actual range measured antenna patterns with CCP generated patterns demonstrates the overall accuracy of simulating the receive and transmit MBA's.

40|$|Economic {{analysis}} has long {{suggested that there}} are two distinct categories of cases in which the fair use defense, which permits the unauthorized reproduction and other use of copyrighted materials, should apply: first, when the transaction cost of negotiating with the copyright owner for permission to use exceeds the private value of the use to the would-be user; and second, when the individual use is thought to generate some positive externality, such that the net social value of the use exceeds the value to the copyright owner of preventing the use, which in turn may exceed the value of the use to the individual user. Considerable anecdotal evidence, however, suggests that would-be users are often deterred from engaging in conduct that likely would fall within the ambit of fair use, due in part to concerns over incurring attorneys 2 ̆ 7 fees and also to the uncertainty and unpredictability of fair use doctrine itself. This article presents a model of the private costs and benefits faced by would-be users of copyrighted materials in precisely those settings in which economic analysis suggests that the fair use doctrine should apply. The model demonstrates how, under current law, this balance of private costs and benefits may cause some users to forgo legitimate fair uses, particularly when those users are risk-averse. It also suggests that, in cases in which fair use is justified by the presence of positive externalities flowing from the individual user 2 ̆ 7 s use, the asymmetry between individual <b>user</b> <b>gain</b> and copyright owner loss may result in systematic copyright overenforcement; put another way, the fair use doctrine suffers from an 2 ̆ 2 appropriability 2 ̆ 2 problem similar to that which is often cited as a justification for copyright protection itself.

40|$|People are documenting {{themselves}} and/or {{are being}} documented digitally. Large {{amounts of data}} are being generated and aggregated. This creates both challenges and opportunities. The sheer amount, complexity and (intentional) obscurity of data hinder people from understanding it. This in turn creates obstacles for people to become independent individuals and competent citizens. We, as researchers and practitioners, aspire to make tools that help people explore and understand the data collected about themselves, and help them make more informed decisions. In Online Social Networks (OSNs), {{because of the difficulty}} in managing many online friends, users often experience the privacy problem ``context collision'', where their posts are seen by undesired audiences. This may not only lead to awkwardness or embarrassment, users are also disempowered in their online identity construction. We addressed this problem by investigating ``friend-grouping'' strategies, comparing community detection algorithms and developing an exploratory ego-network visualization tool, named FreeBu. Also, as required by privacy-as-practice and critical data literacy, it is equally important to help a <b>user</b> <b>gain</b> insight into the behavior of user groups that are beyond ego-networks. More specifically, we investigated how Facebook users with different characteristics express sentiments, and how the texts posted on Facebook with different privacy settings exhibit different sentiments. On the one hand, we drew the links between our hypothesis testing and existing sociological research. On the other hand, we proposed and implemented algorithms that extract subgroup comparisons for the purpose of exploratory data analysis. Furthermore, as individuals' activities are recorded and collected by companies, governments or other organizations, discriminatory decisions could be made against them. We looked into the field of Discrimination-aware Data Mining (DaDM). More specifically, we leveraged existing DaDM techniques, proposed meta-level measures and developed an exploratory visualization tool, named D-Explorer, that can help people explore and better understand discriminatory patterns. Finally, we compared and summarized state-of-the-art Javascript data-visualization libraries in terms of application domains, abstraction levels, visualization tasks and design patterns. We further translated visualization taxonomies to library design requirements, in order to comprehensively capture different aspects of data-visualization development. We also proposed improvements for future data-visualization library design. In sum, this thesis took an interdisciplinary approach towards OSN privacy and aggregate data literacy. We iteratively designed and implemented two exploratory visualization tools. During this process, we leveraged the knowledge from the fields of information visualization, software engineering, human computer interaction, data mining and microsociology. status: publishe...|$|E
