5|$|A tantric {{interpretation}} sees Shiva as {{consciousness and}} Kali as power or energy. Consciousness and energy are dependent <b>upon</b> <b>each</b> other, since Shiva depends on Shakti, or energy, {{in order to}} fulfill his role in creation, preservation, and destruction. In this view, without Shakti, Shiva is a corpse — unable to act.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the widely}} held {{view that the}} authors of the Synoptic Gospels drew <b>upon</b> <b>each</b> other (the {{so-called}} synoptic problem), other scholars take it as significant that the virgin birth is attested by two separate gospels, Matthew and Luke.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Dunst co-starred in {{the fantasy}} {{adventure}} film Jumanji, {{loosely based on}} Chris Van Allsburg's 1981 book of the same name. The story is about a supernatural and ominous board game which makes animals and other jungle hazards appear <b>upon</b> <b>each</b> roll of the dice. She {{was part of an}} ensemble cast that included Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt and David Alan Grier. The movie grossed $262million worldwide. That year, and again in 2002, she was named one of People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People.|$|E

In October 2017, Boone said {{that there will be}} sequels to The New Mutants starting with a second film that would feature Warlock and Xi'an Manh / Karma, joining the team. He added that each film will explore a different style within the horror movie genre.|$|E
5|$|Olid {{sought to}} prevent Las Casas from disembarking, and hastily {{sent a message}} to recall Briones. The two Spanish fleets soon opened fire <b>upon</b> <b>each</b> other while Olid {{attempted}} to negotiate a truce in order to delay Las Casas offshore until Briones returned. Las Casas secretly sent messages to Briones, attempting to buy his support against Olid. Briones, looking out for his own interests, delayed his return. At this point, Las Casas' fleet was caught in a sudden storm and wrecked upon the Honduran coast, killing some of Las Casas' men. The survivors were captured by Olid.|$|E
5|$|Ørsted did {{not fully}} {{understand}} his discovery, but he observed the effect was reciprocal: a current exerts a force on a magnet, and a magnetic field exerts a force on a current. The phenomenon was further investigated by Ampère, who discovered that two parallel current-carrying wires exerted a force <b>upon</b> <b>each</b> other: two wires conducting currents {{in the same direction}} are attracted to each other, while wires containing currents in opposite directions are forced apart. The interaction is mediated by the magnetic field each current produces and forms the basis for the international definition of the ampere.|$|E

5|$|As simple {{ultra vires}} {{concerns}} the exact powers conferred upon government ministers and statutory bodies, statutory interpretation {{is arguably the}} most important exercise the courts need to engage in to determine the scope of powers laid out in the statute. Hence, the cases decided are fact-specific and depend <b>upon</b> <b>each</b> court's interpretation of the relevant statute, making success of the judicial review somewhat unpredictable. The UK case of Attorney General v. Fulham Corporation (1921), illustrates this concept. The defendant was a statutory body establishing washhouses and baths for residents who could not afford their own washing facilities. When it subsequently established a laundry service, the defendant was declared to have acted ultra vires since its statutory purpose was not to carry on a business. Even though the business was carried out at a substantial loss, the statute in question did not give the defendant such a power to do so. Accordingly, the plaintiff was entitled to succeed.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing or {{congestion}} charges is {{a system}} of surcharging users of public goods that are subject to congestion through excess demand such as higher peak charges for use of bus services, electricity, metros, railways, telephones, and road pricing to reduce traffic congestion; airlines and shipping companies may be charged higher fees for slots at airports and through canals at busy times. This pricing strategy regulates demand, {{making it possible to}} manage congestion without increasing supply. Market economics theory, which encompasses the congestion pricing concept, postulates that users will be forced to pay for the negative externalities they create, making them conscious of the costs they impose <b>upon</b> <b>each</b> other when consuming during the peak demand, and more aware of their impact on the environment.|$|E
5|$|Fundamental {{physical}} constants {{are often}} highly dependent <b>upon</b> <b>each</b> other. This {{implies that the}} best value of a fundamental physical constant, one with the least uncertainty, often can be determined by directly measuring other fundamental physical constants, from which the value can be calculated. The uncertainty in these constants is then determined from {{the uncertainty of the}} others by the propagation of uncertainty. Constants whose value is fixed, for determining the units in which they are expressed, don't have an uncertainty associated with them, so they do not account for any extra uncertainty {{in the value of the}} calculated constant. One of the reasons the SI unit system will be changed is that determination of values can often be greatly improved if expressed in these new units. This is due to the dependence of these values on physical constants.|$|E

5|$|In Flow, {{the player}} guides a small, multi-segmented worm- or snake-like {{creature}} through an aquatic environment. There are no menus or guidelines; the game begins immediately. The game world, which is viewed from a top-down perspective, consists of two-dimensional planes stacked vertically <b>upon</b> <b>each</b> other. A blurred {{version of the}} layer below appears {{in the background of}} each plane. Planes contain organisms of varying sizes; the player's creature automatically attempts to consume them when they are nearby. The majority of these creatures are non-confrontational, and are composed of cells that increase the number of segments in the player's creature when eaten. All planes, except for the highest and lowest, contain two specially colored organisms that move the player's creature up or down one plane when touched.|$|E
5|$|In {{the history}} of the Gold Glove Award, there have been eleven double-play combinations, or pairs of middle infielders, that have won awards in the same year. Shortstops and second basemen depend <b>upon</b> <b>each</b> other for the {{majority}} of double plays. The most common type of double play occurs with a runner on first base and a ground ball hit towards the middle of the infield. The player fielding the ball (generally the shortstop or second baseman) throws to the fielder covering second base, who steps on the base before the runner from first arrives to force that runner out, and then throws the ball to the first baseman to force out the batter for the second out. Mark Belanger won four Gold Gloves with the Baltimore Orioles alongside winning partner Bobby Grich, and Joe Morgan paired with Dave Concepción for four combination wins with the Cincinnati Reds. The most recent teammates to accomplish the feat are Brandon Crawford and Joe Panik, who won with the San Francisco Giants in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Like Caroline herself (who {{was created}} Baroness Vaughan upon {{the birth of}} their first son), the two boys were granted {{courtesy}} titles, but no official royal decrees were ever issued by Leopold, the Belgian government, or any other foreign state, causing them to be merely honorary. Because of their parents' legally invalid marriage, their two sons were still deemed illegitimate. <b>Upon</b> <b>each</b> of their births, they had been registered in France under Caroline's name; no mention of Leopold or another potential father was made. Despite these facts, there were fears in Belgium that Leopold would recognize his eldest son as heir to the throne. Had Leopold married in a legal civil ceremony, the boy could have indeed inherited the throne, because all classes were equal under the Belgian constitution, and thus their marriage would not have been considered morganatic. In 1910, the two boys were adopted by Antoine Durrieux, whom Caroline married soon after Leopold's death.|$|E

5|$|Players will {{be granted}} {{experience}} points <b>upon</b> <b>each</b> match. After they have collected sufficient experience points, players can level up, by which new armor, skins, weapons, and power-ups would be unlocked for players to use. Both the player character and weapon can be customized extensively by applying new skins and colors onto them. In addition, players can receive hack modules while playing the game, which are special abilities {{that can only}} be used once after they are collected. There are six types of modules. Scout reveals the locations of all enemies to the player for a limited time after respawning, while Vital Signs shows all enemies' health. Retribution allows players to track their last killer by showing their health and location, while Power Seeker guides players to the power weapon pickup in the game. The Resupply Timer, meanwhile, shows the respawn time of the power-up items. Players can also perform taunts in the game's multiplayer.|$|E
5|$|Team {{effectiveness}} (also {{referred to}} as group effectiveness) is the capacity a team has to accomplish the goals or objectives administered by an authorized personnel or the organization. A team {{is a collection of}} individuals who are interdependent in their tasks, share responsibility for outcomes, and view themselves as a unit embedded in an institutional or organizational system which operates within the established boundaries of that system. Teams and groups have established a synonymous relationship within the confines of processes and research relating to their effectiveness (i.e. group cohesiveness, teamwork) while still maintaining their independence as two separate units, as groups and their members are independent of each other's role, skill, knowledge or purpose versus teams and their members, who are interdependent <b>upon</b> <b>each</b> other's role, skill, knowledge and purpose.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese army {{left its}} {{fortress}} at Elvas on 12 July and arrived outside Badajoz the following day. A company of cuirassiers under dom Luiz de Menezes and some cavalry troops commanded by dom André de Albuquerque were confronted near a {{bridge over the}} Guadiana river by a Spanish cavalry party led by the Duke of Osuna. Both units retreated after inflicting serious losses <b>upon</b> <b>each</b> other in a bloody fight, the Spanish seeking protection behind {{the walls of the}} town. Mendes de Vasconcelos arrived shortly thereafter with the main Portuguese army, with its artillery, and a large number of supply wagons brought from Elvas. Seeing the strength of the Portuguese army, the Duke of San German hastily sent a message calling on Philip IV for help.|$|E

5|$|The {{pictures}} {{are not in}} strictly chronological order. If they are perceived as three groups, then the pictures {{in each of the}} three units inform <b>upon</b> <b>each</b> other, in the same way as was usual in Medieval paintings and stained glass. The three sections of Creation, Downfall, and Fate of Humanity appear in reverse order, when read from the entrance of the chapel. However, each individual scene is painted to be viewed when looking toward the altar. This is not easily apparent when viewing a reproduced image of the ceiling but becomes clear when the viewer looks upward at the vault. Paoletti and Radke suggest that this reversed progression symbolises a return to a state of grace. However, the three sections are generally described in the order of Biblical chronology.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{of these shows}} developed them using a variant on the CTW model, a flexible model of production based upon {{the experiences of the}} creators and {{producers of}} the U.S. show. The model consisted of the combination of producers and researchers working together on the show, the development of a unique curriculum, and extensive test screening of the shows. The shows came to be called co-productions, and they contained original sets, characters, and curriculum goals. Different co-productions were produced, depending <b>upon</b> <b>each</b> country's needs and resources. They included both dubbed versions of the American show and versions created, developed, and produced in each country that reflected their needs, educational priorities, and culture. For example, the first HIV-positive Muppet, Kami, from the South African co-production Takalani Sesame, was created in 2003 to address the epidemic of AIDS in South Africa, and was met with controversy in the U.S.. By 2006, there were 20co-productions in countries all over the world. In 2001, there were more than 120million viewers of all international versions of Sesame Street, and by the US show's 40thanniversary in 2009, they were seen in more than 140countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{reign of}} Edward III {{coincided with the}} {{so-called}} Babylonian Captivity of the papacy at Avignon. During the wars with France, opposition emerged in England against perceived injustices by a papacy largely controlled by the French crown. Papal taxation of the English Church was suspected to be financing the nation's enemies, while the practice of provisions – the Pope providing benefices for clerics – caused resentment in the English population. The statutes of Provisors and Praemunire, of 1350 and 1353 respectively, aimed to amend this by banning papal benefices, as well as limiting {{the power of the}} papal court over English subjects. The statutes did not sever the ties between the king and the Pope, who were equally dependent <b>upon</b> <b>each</b> other.|$|E
