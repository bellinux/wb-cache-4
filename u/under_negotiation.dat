5|$|These {{areas have}} or {{will have a}} {{different}} mandate than their terrestrial counterparts. They are designed for sustainable use, although they usually also contain areas designed to protect ecological integrity. The government {{has announced plans to}} add five marine parks to the system as part of the Marine Conservation Areas Act. The first to be announced was Lake Superior in 2007; it was officially established in 2015. Other areas <b>under</b> <b>negotiation</b> are the southern Strait of Georgia and Gwaii Haanas in British Columbia, and there are discussions to study the feasibility of an area on the southern coast of Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|No {{work was}} done to the ship over the {{following}} two years. On 18 January 1904, Ottoman negotiators began {{a new round of}} talks with Krupp, demanding a reduction in the cost of the modernization from 282,000lira to 65,000lira; this amount does not cover the preparatory work that had been initially carried out, let alone the reconstruction. In return, the Ottoman government would order a pair of torpedo cruisers—the —from Germaniawerft. With the armament contract still <b>under</b> <b>negotiation,</b> Krupp was forced to concede, despite the significant financial loss the reconstruction deal represented. By April, the armament contract was signed, and so work began slowly on Asar-i Tevfik. Work was completed by late 1906. The reconstructed ship departed Kiel on 19 November, and arrived in Constantinople on 4 January 1907.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Soviet proposal, Macmillan met with Eisenhower at Camp David {{to devise a}} response. The Anglo-American counterproposal agreed to ban small {{underground}} tests (those under magnitude 4.75) on a temporary basis (a duration of roughly 1 year, versus the Soviet proposal of 4–5 years), but this could only happen after verifiable tests had been banned and a seismic research group (the Seismic Research Program Advisory Group) convened. The Soviet Union responded positively to the counterproposal and the research group convened on 11 May 1960. The Soviet Union also offered to keep an underground ban out of the treaty <b>under</b> <b>negotiation.</b> In May 1960, there were high hopes that an agreement would be reached at an upcoming summit of Eisenhower, Khrushchev, Macmillan, and Charles de Gaulle of France in Paris.|$|E

5|$|The four N3 battleships {{were never}} ordered because the Washington Naval Treaty, an arms {{limitation}} treaty <b>under</b> <b>negotiation</b> at the time, forbade construction of any ship larger than 35,000 tons. Many of {{the aspects of}} their design ultimately were incorporated into the two s, and they are often described as being a cut-down N3. Indeed, the Nelsons received the design designation 'O3', marking them as next in the design sequence, although they used the guns intended for the G3 battlecruisers for cost reasons and {{to comply with the}} Treaty's 16-inch limitation on main armament. Though far from receiving names, the four vessels of the N3 design have since been associated, albeit speculatively, with the names of the four patron saints of Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales, those being HMS St. Andrew, HMS St. George, HMS St. Patrick and HMS St. David respectively.|$|E
25|$|Doha Round {{talks are}} {{overseen by the}} Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC), whose chair is the WTO’s director-general, {{currently}} Roberto Azevêdo.

25|$|As {{the protests}} continued, protesters in El Alto, a {{sprawling}} indigenous city of 750,000 {{people on the}} periphery of La Paz, proceeded to block key access routes to the capital causing severe fuel and food shortages. They also demanded the resignation of Sánchez de Lozada and his ministers, Yerko Kukoc, Minister of Government, and Carlos Sánchez de Berzaín, Minister of Defense, who were held responsible for the Warisata massacre. Protesters also voiced their opposition to the Free Trade Area of the Americas agreement that was at the time <b>under</b> <b>negotiation</b> by the US and Latin American countries (since the November 2005 Mar del Plata Summit of the Americas, it has been put on stand-by).|$|E

25|$|Turkey's {{accession}} talks {{have since been}} stalled {{by a number of}} domestic and external problems. Both Austria and France have said they would hold a referendum on Turkey's accession. In the case of France, a change in its Constitution was made to impose such a referendum, but later another constitutional change has enabled the parliament (if a large majority of its members agrees) to prevent such a referendum. The issue of Cyprus continues to be a major obstacle to negotiations. European officials have commented on the slowdown in Turkish reforms which, combined with the Cyprus problem, led the EU’s Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn in March 2007 to warn of an impending ‘train crash’ in the negotiations. Due to these setbacks, negotiations again came to a halt in December 2006, with the EU freezing talks in 8 of the 35 key areas <b>under</b> <b>negotiation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The ministers {{emphasised}} {{the need}} to unite {{on the issue of}} Doha round of negotiations. This is supported by increased consultations, by IBSA delegations, in order to strengthen Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA), as well as the establishment of the NAMA-11 whose two main principles are supporting flexibilities for developing countries and balance between NAMA and other areas <b>under</b> <b>negotiation.</b> The Ministers took note of the broader objectives of the European Union proposed Registration, Evaluation and Authorization and restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Legislation, in respect of the protection of human health and the environment. They expressed their concern for the consequences REACH may have on the developing economies of the South. Such consequences will negatively affect the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals in these countries. The ministers urged the EU to give due consideration to these consequences and also ensure that REACH does not become a Technical Barrier to Trade (TBT).|$|E
500|$|President Smetona held a {{government}} meeting {{late on the}} night of March 18, to decide whether to accept the ultimatum. Lithuania clearly lacked international support and the demand was rather tame. A refusal would have cast Lithuania in an unfavorable light as an unreasonable disputant that had irrationally rejected peaceful diplomatic relations for eighteen years. Lithuanian diplomats were divided on the issue, while popular opinion was strongly against accepting the ultimatum. Various campaigns for the Lithuanian liberation of Vilnius had attracted massive participation. [...] "Mourning of Vilnius Day" [...] (October 9, when Żeligowski invaded Lithuania and captured Vilnius), had become an annual event, and the largest social organization in interwar Lithuania was the League for the Liberation of Vilnius (Vilniaus vadavimo sąjunga, or VVS), with some 25,000 members. Passionate feelings about Vilnius were expressed in a popular slogan [...] "Mes be Vilniaus nenurimsim" [...] (we will not rest without Vilnius), part of a poem by Petras Vaičiūnas. While Paul Hymans' regional peace plans at the League of Nations were <b>under</b> <b>negotiation,</b> Lithuanian Prime Minister Ernestas Galvanauskas barely survived an assassination attempt. A government decision to open over 80 Polish schools in Lithuania was a probable factor in the 1926 Lithuanian coup d'état. Any government making concessions to Poland at that time risked an ouster.|$|E

The growing de-facto economic integration combined with a lack of common economic institutions has led Asian countries to adopt pro-FTAs trade policies.|$|R
