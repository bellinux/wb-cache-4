5|$|Charles {{suffered}} a sudden apoplectic {{fit on the}} morning of 2 February 1685, and died aged 54 at 11:45am four days later at Whitehall Palace. The suddenness of his illness and death led to suspicion of poison in the minds of many, including one of the royal doctors; however, a more modern medical analysis has held that the symptoms of his final illness {{are similar to those of}} <b>uraemia</b> (a clinical syndrome due to kidney dysfunction). In the days between his collapse and his death, Charles endured a variety of torturous treatments including bloodletting, purging and cupping in hopes of effecting a recovery.|$|E
5|$|On May 14, 1914, Bradley {{announced}} his intent {{to retire from}} politics upon the completion of his term, owing to the decline of his general health. Hurrying to board a streetcar following his announcement, Bradley suffered a serious fall, sustaining two broken fingers, head trauma, and internal injuries. After briefly attempting {{to return to his}} duties, he became bedfast, and died on May 23, 1914. His official cause of death was listed as <b>uraemia.</b> Upon Bradley's death, both houses of Congress passed resolutions expressing their sympathy, and promptly adjourned out of respect. His body was returned to Frankfort for burial, but in accordance with the wishes of Bradley and his family, did not lie in state. He was buried in the state cemetery in Frankfort.|$|E
25|$|Clover's {{health was}} fragile {{throughout}} his life. He died of <b>uraemia</b> aged 57. He {{is buried in}} Brompton Cemetery, London. His grave is only 200 yards away from that of fellow anaesthetics pioneer, John Snow.|$|E
25|$|The bladder may rupture if overfilled and not emptied. This {{can occur}} {{in the case of}} binge {{drinkers}} having consumed very large quantities, but are not aware, due to stupor, of the need to urinate. This condition is very rare in women, but it does occur. Symptoms include localized pain and <b>uraemia</b> (poisoning due to reabsorbed waste). The recovery rate is high, with most fatalities due to septic blood poisoning. A person is more likely to urinate while passed out before the bladder ruptures, as alcohol relaxes the muscles that normally control their bladder.|$|E
25|$|By November 1972, Rajagopalachari's health {{had begun}} to decline and on 17 December the same year, a week after his 94th birthday, he was {{admitted}} to the Government Hospital, Madras suffering from <b>uraemia,</b> dehydration and a urinary infection. In the hospital, he was visited by Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, V. R. Nedunchezhiyan, V. V. Giri, Periyar and other state and national leaders. Rajagopalachari's condition deteriorated in the following days as he frequently lost consciousness and he died at 5:44pm on 25 December 1972 at the age of 94. His son, C. R. Narasimhan, was at his bedside {{at the time of his}} death reading him verses from a Hindu holy book.|$|E

50|$|John Norton died at {{a private}} {{hospital}} in Melbourne of <b>Uraemia</b> and kidney failure on 9 April 1916. He had been seriously ill for some months and {{had been in a}} coma for a week before his death. His wife, son and daughter were at his bedside when he died.|$|E
5000|$|Bladder rupture (rupture of bladder, [...] ) {{may occur}} if the bladder is overfilled and not emptied. This {{can occur in}} the case of binge {{drinkers}} who have consumed large quantities of fluids, but are not conscious of the need to urinate due to stupor.

50|$|Haemolytic-uremic {{syndrome}} or HUS is haemolytic anaemia, acute {{kidney failure}} (<b>uraemia),</b> and thrombocytopenia. HUS is caused by E. coli bloody diarrhea and specific strains of shiga toxin. The bacteria in HUS cause damage to the endothelium which results in platelet activation and formation of microthrombi. Red cells get trapped in the fibrin strands of the microthrombi and become sheared {{by the force of}} blood flow leading to schistocyte formation.|$|E

Australian Fleet arriving at Sydney Heads' and a portrait of Rear-Admiral George Patey are at Buckingham Palace.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms {{can vary}} from person to person. Someone in early stage kidney disease may not feel sick or notice {{symptoms}} as they occur. When kidneys fail to filter properly, waste accumulates in the blood and the body, a condition called azotemia. Very low levels of azotaemia may produce few, if any, symptoms. If the disease progresses, symptoms become noticeable (if the failure is of sufficient degree to cause symptoms). Kidney failure accompanied by noticeable symptoms is termed <b>uraemia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{autumn of}} 1887, {{progressive}} renal failure brought his medical activities to an end. He developed leg oedema, crippling headaches and transient memory loss. Sometimes {{he stopped in}} the middle of a sentence and was unable to continue. He died of <b>uraemia</b> on 20 July 1888, five days before his 41st birthday. He is buried in the British Cemetery of Funchal on Madeira, a place he had chosen, describing it as a “true graveyard, isolated and quiet, a good place to rest.” ...|$|E

50|$|After his {{successful}} appeal, Wallace {{returned to his}} job in insurance but public opinion in the areas where he lived and worked was strongly of the view {{that he had been}} guilty and had 'got away with it'. Many of his previous customers shunned him; he was subjected to hate mail and physical threats and had to take a clerical job at his employer's head office. At the same time, he moved to a bungalow in Bromborough. Still employed by 'The Pru', he died aged 54 from <b>uraemia</b> and pyelonephritis in 1933 at the Clatterbridge Hospital.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cause of}} prurigo nodularis is unknown, {{although}} other conditions may induce PN. PN {{has been linked}} to Becker's nevus, linear IgA disease, an autoimmune condition, liver disease [...] and T cells. Systemic pruritus {{has been linked to}} cholestasis, thyroid disease, polycythaemia rubra vera, <b>uraemia,</b> Hodgkins disease, HIV and other immunodeficiency diseases. Internal malignancies, liver failure, renal failure, and psychiatric illnesses have been considered to induce PN, although more recent research has refuted a psychiatric cause for PN. Patients report an ongoing battle to distinguish themselves from those with psychiatric disorders such as delusions of parasitosis and other psychiatric conditions.|$|E

5000|$|Prendergast {{moved to}} Eastbourne, {{where he lived}} at Meads House. By 1946 he was senile and {{developed}} a bladder infection, {{for which he was}} treated by society doctor and suspected serial killer Dr John Bodkin Adams. Adams would visit twice a day and prescribed morphine. On the morning of 14 May 1946, Prendergast slipped into a coma and died at 7.30 p.m. that evening. Adams certified the death as a) <b>uraemia</b> and b) chronic nephritis. His nurse, Anne Masters, later told police, [...] "I am quite convinced that the injections of morphia hastened Sir Prendergast's sic death". Adams was tried for the murder of Edith Alice Morrell in 1957 but acquitted, though police suspected him of a total of 163 murders.|$|E
50|$|In 1922 he {{published}} the re-written primer, basta:nnɯ suruk bicik. In the same year, the Yakut language {{was introduced in}} schools of Yakut ASSR. In 1923, the new Yakut font was made in Petrograd. Another primer, suruk bicik and a book for reading Aaghar Kinige were published. This primer was {{much better than the}} others and consisted of five parts: fiction, history, geography, medicine and folklore. In 1923-24 the primer was spread all over Yakutia and likbezy (special schools for illiterates) started their work. As new presses appeared in the republic, it became possible for the local leaders to print their own newspapers and the first of these, kɯ:m, was published in 1923. Until 1930, when Yakut was switched to Jaꞑalif, more than 200 books were published in the Novgorodov alphabet, including 30 schoolbooks. A new alphabet gave a major impulse to the development of Yakut culture.In 1922 Novgorodov graduated the university and along with M. K. Ammosov represented Yakutia in Narkomnats (Peoples' Committee for Nationalities). He participated in the commission for delimitation of Yakutia's borders. Also Novgorodov was a deputy of IX Congress of the Soviets, elected by Yakutsk Governorate Congress of the Revolutionary Committee. Semyon Novgorodov died of <b>uraemia</b> in the prime of his life at February 28, 1924.|$|E
40|$|The humoral {{immune status}} of {{patients}} with <b>uraemia</b> is controversial. In the present experiments a carefully defined animal model, in which a chronic state of moderate and severe <b>uraemia</b> was induced, {{has been used to}} resolve conflicting views. The capacity of the <b>uraemia</b> host to respond to immunogenic stimulation was assessed by challenging uraemic animals with bacterial, viral, T cell-dependent and T cell-independent antigens. The experiments have shown that the immune responsiveness of animals with chronic severe <b>uraemia,</b> immunized with sheep red blood cells, Escherichia coli 075, keyhole limpet haemocyanin and phi X 174 bacteriophage is comparable to those found in sham-operated and control groups. The results strongly suggest that <b>uraemia</b> per se does not affect the ability of the host to respond {{to a wide range of}} antigenic stimuli. This conclusion is important in that it provides a basis for assessing further the immune status of the uraemic host. If uraemic patients do have an immune deficit, one possible explanation is that <b>uraemia</b> potentiates the immunosuppressive activity of some drugs used in the clinical management of these patients...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Glycohaemoglobin {{in human}} blood can be {{determined}} by several methods. We investigated three methods used in daily practice, viz. affinity chromatography, HPLC and electrophoresis * We examined the influence of <b>uraemia</b> in diabetic and non-diabetic patients on the results obtained with HPLC and electrophoresis and com-pared these with the results obtained with affinity chromatography. Our current method (electrophoresis) proved to be very sensitive to <b>uraemia</b> giving falsely elevated levels of HbAj. HPLC was not disturbed by <b>uraemia...</b>|$|E
40|$|Levels of {{the factor}} VIII complex {{were found to be}} raised in {{patients}} with chronic renal failure and further raised by regular dialysis. Increased fibrinogen concentrations were also found. These results suggest the existence of a prothrombotic state in <b>uraemia</b> that is exacerbated by haemodialysis. Ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination, however, was depressed in <b>uraemia</b> and worsened by dialysis. This defect may be transferred to normal platelets from dialysed uraemic plasma, suggesting the existence of an inhibitor of the interaction between factor VIII and platelet glycoprotein. These results may help to explain the anomaly of a prolonged bleeding time together with accelerated atherogenesis that is found in patients with <b>uraemia</b> receiving dialysis...|$|E
40|$|Rat {{experiments}} {{indicate that}} chemical antagonism to DNA synthesis {{may account for}} the decrease in liver cell replication and lymphocyte responsiveness encountered in liver disease and <b>uraemia.</b> Investigations of the incorporation of [3 H]thymidine into DNA following CCl 4 induced liver injury indicate that <b>uraemia</b> decreases DNA synthesis in hepatocytes, mesenchymal cells and lymphocytes. Under the conditions of these experiments <b>uraemia</b> had no effect on the severity of the hepatic necrosis and CCl 4 did not significantly change the level of serum urea in nephrectomized animals. Dialysis or heating of uraemic plasma at 56 ° for 30 minutes abolished its suppressant effect on hepatic DNA synthetic capacity...|$|E
40|$|Aims <b>Uraemia</b> is {{a strong}} risk factor for {{cardiovascular}} disease. Osteopontin (OPN) is highly expressed in aortas of uraemic apolipoprotein E knockout (E KO) mice. OPN affects key atherogenic processes, i. e. inflammation and phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). We explored the role of OPN on vascular pathology in uraemic mice. Methods and results <b>Uraemia</b> was induced by 5 / 6 nephrectomy in E KO and in OPN and E double KO mice (E/OPN KO). In E KO mice, <b>uraemia</b> increased the relative surface plaque area in the aortic arch (from 28 + 2 % [n 15], to 37 + 3 % [n 20] of the aortic arch area, P, 0. 05). A positive correlation was observed between plasma OPN and aortic atherosclerosis in uraemic E KO mice (r 2 0. 48, P 0. 001).

40|$|Serial {{tuberculin}} skin {{tests with}} 0 · 1 – 100 TU of PPD {{were performed on}} 209 patients with chronic renal disease. Skin test reactivity decreased with the severity of <b>uraemia.</b> Lymphocytes from {{three out of four}} skin test negative patients showed a high PPD-induced blast response in vitro.

40|$|In 45 {{patients}} with chronic <b>uraemia</b> the basal acid output {{was the same as}} in 22 controls. Maximal acid output in uraemic patients was less than in the controls but not significantly so. In <b>uraemia</b> the maximal acid output was directly related to the duration of <b>uraemia</b> and inversely related to both haemoglobin level and age; it was not related to the height of the blood urea. Neutralization of gastric acid by ammonia probably occurred in the basal juice, but not when acid secretion was maximally stimulated. The presence of secondary hyperparathyroidism was associated with a 50 % increase in the maximal acid output, but the increase may have been due to the younger age of this group...|$|E
40|$|Kidney {{involvement}} by Non-Hodgkin&#x 2032;s lymphoma {{is very common}} microscopically but rarely a cause of <b>uraemia</b> even when the parenchymatous involvement is considerable.

This {{is a case where}} the patient presented to the ophthalmic O. P. D. with blurring of vision and admitted with full blown <b>uraemia.</b> He could not be saved and at autopsy, a gastrointestinal lymphoma was found in the caecum. His <b>uraemia</b> was due to massive parenchymatous involvement of the kidney, there being no ureteral obstruction, hypercalcaemia, urate or immunologically mediated nephropathy.
