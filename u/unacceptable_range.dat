40|$|Experimental {{tests have}} been {{completed}} which recorded the ability of two combination steady state and high response time varying Pitot probe designs to accurately measure steady stagnation pressure at a single location in a flow field. Tests were conducted of double-barreled and coannular Prati probes in a 3. 5 ” diameter free jet probe calibration facility from Mach 0. 1 to 0. 9. Geometric symmetry and pitch (- 40 to + 40 degrees) and yaw (0 to + 40 degrees) angle actuation were used to fully evaluate the probes. These tests revealed that the double-barreled configuration induced error in its steady state measurement at zero incidence that increased consistently with jet Mach number to 1. 1 % at Mach 0. 9. For all Mach numbers, the double-barreled probe nulled at a pitch angle of approximately 7 degrees and provided inconsistent measurements when yawed. The double-barreled probe provided adequate measurements via both its steady state and high response tubes (within +/- 0. 15 % accuracy) over <b>unacceptable</b> <b>ranges</b> of biased pitch and inconsistent yaw angles which varied with Mach number. By comparison, the coannular probe provided accurate measurements (at zero incidence) for all jet Mach numbers as well as over a flow angularity range which varied from +/- 25. 8 degrees at Mach 0. 3 to +/- 14. 2 degrees at Mach 0. 9. Based on these results, the Prati probe is established as the preferred design. Further experimental tests are recommended to document the frequency response characteristics of the Prati probe.

40|$|Background: The Integrated Logistics System (ILS), {{a system}} for {{reporting}} about use of drugs and related medical supplies and for requesting resupply, designed {{to move beyond the}} previous supply system by integrating the drugs and supplies for numerous vertical programs. Unsatisfactory performance of ILS fail to fulfill the six right of logistic system of ensuring that the right medicines, in the right quantities, in the right condition are delivered to the right place, at the right time for the right cost. However the performance of ILS in Singida region, Tanzania is unknown. Objective: To assess the performance of integrated logistic system in health facilities in Singida region, Tanzania Methods: The study was a cross sectional survey using logistic indicator assessment tools, developed by JSI DELIVER PROJECT for assessing the performance of logistic system in health facilities. It was conducted between April and May 2013. For this study a total of 55 health facilities were included of which 15 health centers were selected by convenient and 40 dispensaries selected randomly. The central zone Medical Stores Department (MSD – Dodoma) was included as the sole government agency for medicines and medical supplies in public health facilities and makes a samples size of 56 Results: Stockout duration was observed to be high for oxytocin injection, artemether/lumefantrine tablets and amoxycillin capsules and low for dizepam injection in all districts. The average supply gap ranged from 28. 9 % in Singida Municipal to 45. 6 % in Singida District. The average order fulfillment rate ranged from 54. 4 % in Singida District to 71. 1 % in Singida Municipal. Over supply of tracer medicines was found in Singida Municipal and delivery of unordered was observed in Singida Municipal, Iramba and Manyoni Districts. The average delivery time of medicines consignment in districts ranged from 16. 5 to 48 hours in Singida Municipal and Singida district respectively and it was found to be independent on the distance from the zonal MSD. Availability of LMIS register ranged from 85. 5 % for injection and 98. 2 % for patient registers, filling accuracy ranged from 68. 1 % for injection to 93 % for dispensing registers. Majority of health facilities in Singida Municipal adhered to prescribed storage standards while in Manyoni district 60 % health facilities scored in <b>unacceptable</b> <b>range</b> storage condition. Generally 27 % of health facilities visited had good storage conditions, 29 % scored in acceptable range vi and 44 % scored in <b>unacceptable</b> <b>range</b> as per JSI DELIVER/WHO 2003 storage standard.

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{demonstrate}} that manual prostate segmentation in transrectal ultrasound {{images can be}} replaced with semiautomatic segmentation. Methods and MaterialsSemiautomatic segmentation using a tapered ellipsoid model was applied to transrectal ultrasound images. Region-based volumetric evaluation was performed between original and physician-reviewed semiautomatic contours. For dosimetric assessment, treatment plans generated on semiautomatic contours were overlaid on physician-reviewed semiautomatic contours and dose parameters were computed. To establish a threshold for the acceptable amount of dosimetric degradation below which the adoption of semiautomatic planning is <b>unacceptable,</b> the <b>range</b> of variability in dosimetric quality attributed to manual variability was obtained and {{compared with that of}} semiautomatic contours. ResultsAn average volume error (1 —Dice similarity coefficient) of less than 7 % between semiautomatic and manual volumes (140 cases) was obtained. The difference between the mean V 100 of plans created for semiautomatic contours then overlaid on physician-reviewed semiautomatic contours and the original V 100 values, that is, before overlaying on the physician-reviewed contours (41 cases) was lower than 5 %. An average total duration of 2 – 4 min, which includes algorithm initialization, 11. 67 ± 3. 57 s algorithm time, and contour modification is required per case. This algorithm is being used at the British Columbia Cancer Agency and to this date has been applied for the treatment of more than 600 patients. ConclusionsIn terms of volumetric and dosimetric accuracy, the proposed algorithm is a suitable replacement for manual segmentation in the context of our planning technique. The benefits are shorter segmentation times; greater consistency; less reliance on user experience; and smooth, symmetric contours...|$|R
40|$|Background: Lead is an {{inert metal}} and is {{resistant}} to corrosion. It also increases tensile strength of many common materials in daily use. Lead was {{used during the}} Roman period to transport water (hence the name plumbing/plumber is common terminology even in the present day). Lead enters the biological system through the air, water, and dust. Fine particles of lead, having diameter less than 5 nm are directly absorbed by lungs. Inorganic lead is absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract, and organic lead is absorbed by the skin. Lead {{has long been known}} to be a toxic heavy metal and exposure is associated with many deleterious health effects. Still, lead remains a popular ingredient in products ranging from paint to batteries. The lead content in any given material is estimated using various methods. The least cumbersome method is found to be X-Ray Fluorescence technique (XRF). A portable XRF device was used in the present study. Aim: The main aim of this study to investigate whether lead is present in various commonly used plumbing materials. Material and Methods: All types of branded and commonly used pipes were gathered from a market in Bangalore and tested using the XRF machine. In order to evaluate to what extent lead from the pipes could leach into water, seven pipes were randomly selected and filled with Aquafina water (having undetectable level of lead) for a 24 hour period. This water was tested at an NABL accredited laboratory in Bangalore, India for lead content. Result: It was determined that lead was present in many of the samples, at an <b>unacceptable</b> levels <b>ranging</b> from, well above the globally accepted level of 0. 01 mg/L proof that lead was able to leach from the samples into water. Conclusions: As lead in drinking water represents a direct pathway for human exposure, the authors recommend that significant measures be taken to prevent use of lead in the plumbing industry for prevention of it’s deleterious effects. Authors have also recommended non expensive solution to prevent the lead from water getting in to biological or environmental system...|$|R
40|$|There {{seems to}} be a minimal core that every theory wishing to {{accommodate}} the intuition that the future is open must contain: a denial of physical determinism (i. e. the thesis that what future states the universe will be in is implied by what states it has been in), and a denial of strong fatalism (i. e. the thesis that, at every time, what will subsequently be the case is metaphysically necessary). 1 Those two requirements are often associated with the idea of an objective temporal flow and the non-reality of the future. However, at least certain ways to frame the “openness” intuition do not rely on any of these. Branching Time Theory (BTT) is one such: it is compatible with the denial that time flow is objective and it is couched in a language with a (prima facie) commitment to an eternalist ontology. BTT, though, urges us to resist certain intuitions about the determinacy of future claims, which arguably do not lead either to physical determinism or to fatalism. Against BTT, supporters of the Thin Red Line Theory (TRL) argue that their position avoids determinism and fatalism, while also representing {{the fact that there is}} a future which is “special ” because it is the one that will be the case. But starting with Belnap and Green 1994, some have objected to the tenability of TRL, mainly on metaphysical grounds. In particular, those argue that “positing a thin red line amounts to giving up objective indeterminism, ” 2 and that “has <b>unacceptable</b> consequences, <b>ranging</b> from a mistreatment of actuality to an inability to talk coherently about what would have happened had what is going to happen not taken place. ” 3 In this paper, we wish to reframe the 1 Hence, strong fatalism implies physical determinism, while the latter does not imply the former, thus being compatible with the world having been otherwise, assuming that the initial condition of the world could have been otherwise.

Weak fatalism, instead, does not imply, nor is implied, by physical determinism...|$|R
40|$|Ground {{movements}} during deep excavations and tunnelling, {{especially in}} urban areas, may potentially have {{major impact on}} adjacent buildings, structures and utilities. This impact on buildings and structures needs to be assessed by considering the horizontal and vertical displacements induced by deep excavations to determine the necessary mitigation measures. One major factor affecting the degree of severity the impact due to deep excavation may have on the buildings and structures {{is the type of}} foundation systems. While methodology in determining the damage category for the buildings on shallow foundation has been quite well established, the methodology for assessing the impact on the pile foundation is not straightforward due to the geometry and complexity of soil structure interaction. Often simplified two-dimensional (2 D) or comprehensive three-dimensional (3 D) finite element analyses would be carried out for the stage excavation to predict the displacement and stresses in the piles. Suitable protective and preventive measures would need to be designed and implemented for the existing buildings/structures if the damage category falls within the <b>unacceptable</b> <b>range.</b> This paper discusses the analysis and methodology to assess the effect on the pile foundation of a high-rise building due to the deep excavation of the Down Town Line Stage 3 (DTL 3) Tampines West (TPW) Station.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the extent of Prince George's Community College faculty knowledge of the legal issues, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, The Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, and recent court decisions, related to the provision of classroom accommodations for students with disabilities at the postsecondary level. The focus of the study was to determine if a difference existed between the knowledge of full-time and part-time faculty. Part-time faculty comprise over 50 % of the instructional staffs at most community colleges and are considered an integral part of their institutions, yet they are offered little opportunity for professional development. The variables of gender, department affiliation, teaching at more than one institution, number of years of teaching experience, number of students taught with a disability, and number of individuals known with a disability also were reviewed. Data were collected through a questionnaire distributed to 158 faculty members at the college. Twenty-nine packets were returned as undeliverable. Of the 129 deliverable packets, 57 were returned for a response rate of 44. 2 %. Results from the analysis of data indicated that faculty have very limited knowledge of the legal issues concerning students with disabilities. Only 26. 9 % of respondents scored at an acceptable level of knowledge. Additional analysis suggested no relationship existed between faculty knowledge and gender, faculty status (full-time and part-time), department affiliation, teaching at more than one institution, number of years of teaching experience, or number of individuals known with a disability.

40|$|Background: Juvenile-onset {{systemic}} {{lupus erythematosus}} (JSLE) is a rare, severe multisystem autoimmune disease affecting the kidney (Lupus Nephritis, LN) in up to 80 % of children. Numerous individual urinary biomarkers have previously been investigated. No individual biomarker has achieved ‘excellence’ in differentiating active from inactive LN. Aims: (1) To assess performance of traditional clinical biomarkers for LN monitoring and prediction of LN outcomes. (2) To select biomarkers warranting assessment in a ‘LN biomarker panel’; to cross-sectionally assess if combining novel/traditional biomarkers improves active LN identification. (3) To validate the optimal UK LN biomarkers within independent, ethnically distinct JSLE cohorts. (4) To longitudinally assess if urine biomarkers predict LN flare/remission. (5) To streamline methods for LN urine biomarker panel quantification. Methods: Clinical data and urine samples from UK, United States (US) and South African (SA) JSLE patients were utilised within cross-sectional and longitudinal studies assessing combinations of novel urine/traditional clinical biomarkers. A custom LN biomarker panel multiplex assay was developed/validated in collaboration with Merck Millipore. Results: 37 % of UK patients displayed active LN as an initial presenting feature, with a further 17 % developing LN after a median of 2. 04 years [IQR 0. 8 - 3. 7]. ACR score (> 5) and C 3 levels (< 0. 9 g/L) at baseline were significant predictors of subsequent LN development. 39 % of patients recovered from proteinuria following an LN flare during the study period, within a median of 17 months (IQR 4 - 49) with the remaining 61 % continuing to have proteinuria after a median of 22 months (IQR 12 - 41). Younger patients (< 14 yrs), those with a lower eGFR (< 80 mls/min) and haematological involvement at LN onset, displayed a longer time to proteinuria recovery. ESR, C 3, WCC, neutrophils, lymphocytes and IgG contributed significantly to an optimal non-renal traditional biomarker model for active LN identification (AUC 0. 72). Novel urine biomarkers were selected for assessment by detailed literature review. Cross-sectional fitting a binary logistic regression models with data from 61 UK patients, the optimal biomarker combination included AGP+CP+LPGDS+TF (AUC 0. 920). Inclusion of traditional biomarkers within the model did not improve the AUC further. The novel biomarker panel displayed equivalent ability for identifying active LN in 30 US and 23 SA patients (AUC of 0. 991 and 1. 00 respectively). Within the longitudinal study, including 244 observations from 80 UK/US/SA patients, a Markov Multi-State model identified AGP to be predictive flare, and CP of remission (model AIC = 135). By entering individual AGP/CP patient values into the model, 3, 6, 9 and 12 month probabilities of disease state transition are provided. The multiplex assay demonstrated acceptable cross reactivity between multiplexed antibodies, satisfactory spike recovery, intra/inter-assay precision. Linearity of dilution was <b>unacceptable,</b> therefore rigorous <b>range</b> finding in 106 UK/US/SA samples identified the optimal dilutions required for each biomarker. Combining multiplex biomarker values for AGP+CP+LPGDS+TF within a binary logistic regression model, equivalent ability for identification of active LN was seen (multiplex AUC = 0. 998, ELISA AUC = 0. 952). Conclusions: This thesis has demonstrated and validated an ‘excellent’ urinary biomarker panel for active LN identification in three ethnically distinct JSLE cohorts. Different constituents of the biomarker panel are best at predicting LN flare/remission. A custom urine biomarker panel multiplex assay has been developed, demonstrating improved ability for active LN identification over existing ELISAs. Future clinical studies prospectively measuring the urine biomarker panel by multiplex are warranted, facilitating refinement of the Markov Multi-State Model and assessing if biomarker-led monitoring can actually improve renal outcomes for children with LN...|$|R
