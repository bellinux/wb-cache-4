However, the practical or specific <b>utility</b> <b>requirement</b> for patentability may be more difficult to satisfy for chemical compound inventions, because of the level of uncertainty when working with these compounds.

Basic research output, that has no immediate appli-cation except for as a step to further research, may not be patentable be-cause it does not fulfill the <b>utility</b> <b>requirement</b> of patentability. Patentabil-ity of basic research differs from the questions analyzed in the past sequen-tial innovation framework, in that basic research has no market value in itself and patentability of the first-stage invention, rather than that of the second-stage invention, is an issue. There is never immediate gain for the innovator (or static loss to society) of obtaining a patent and the gain is purely from appropriating future success of the application technology. We extend Denicolo (2000) model to identify conditions in which allowing basic research to be patented is socially desirable. ...|$|R

Practically, heat integration between two different time intervals requires indirect integration through intermediate fluid.

The proposed methodology overcomes limitations of existing methodologies and guarantees the optimality as it is proved to be optimum using rigorous mathematical arguments. This methodology is applicable to any fixed-scheduled batch process. Applicability of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through illustrative examples. In one of the illustrative examples, a reduction of 18. 7 % and 16. 4 % (in comparison to time slice model) is observed in hot and cold <b>utility</b> <b>requirements,</b> respectively.

30|$|Different from {{previous}} works, we apply linear pricing {{to improve the}} energy-efficiency of an IFC with noncooperative selfish links to enable distributed implementation. Our objectives also include global stability and fairness. Compared to the work in [3], we do not assume that the channel states are chosen such that a unique global stable Nash equilibrium (NE) exists. Instead, we constrain the prices such that uniqueness and global stability follows. We derive the largest set of prices in which both {{the uniqueness of the}} NE and concurrent transmission are guaranteed, which is then utilized as a constraint in the optimization problem. The contribution is the derivation of the optimal pricing for transmit power minimization under minimum <b>utility</b> <b>requirements</b> and spectrum sharing constraints. If the <b>utility</b> <b>requirements</b> are feasible (Section 4.4), we derive a closed-form expression for the optimal prices (Proposition 6). Another relevant case is to minimize transmit powers such that rate requirements and global stability as well as fairness are achieved. These optimal power allocation and prices are presented in Section 5.3 and feasibility is checked in Proposition 8.|$|E
