5|$|Anne's {{drug use}} {{results in the}} loss of many of her inhibitions, and the film shows her actions under the influence, {{including}} scenes implying sexual promiscuity. As the film progresses, she is fired from her job and begins selling drugs for Markey. Her brother hangs himself when he learns of her new job, and she is arrested and given a tour of the various psychiatric wards and jails in which drug users end up. Finally, after 50 days in jail, she is released, cleaned <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> cooperate with the authorities regarding Markey.|$|E
25|$|All US {{productions}} (including Broadway and its revival) were visually {{identical in}} scale and design {{but the third}} national tour was notable for its portability without sacrificing the Broadway-caliber experience. Thanks to innovative touring techniques borrowed from the pop/rock concert industry, the 4.5million dollar production was adaptable to smaller and larger venues and traveled complete in all of 8 semi tractor trailers. It was set <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> go in less than 24 hours and broken down and packed up in about 16 hours. This allowed it to reach many cities and venues in its acclaimed, original Broadway form.|$|E
25|$|Paddle down: A type of stance by the goaltender {{when the}} play {{is coming from the}} corner {{to the front of the}} net and the puck carrier is {{carrying}} the puck in front of the net looking to score. Here the goaltender puts the stick down on the ground, parallel to the ice, with the leg farthest from the post down and the other <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> push. This works well against angled rushes or wrap arounds where the skater would normally out–skate the goalie. The skater does have the top part of the net to shoot at, but it is difficult to lift the puck over the goalie from up close. The paddle down stance is also effective against low passes from behind the net to players looking to score from the slot.|$|E

60|$|She was <b>up</b> betimes <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> receive {{her early}} {{visitors}} {{with an air}} of triumph, which silenced every jeer and convinced the most skeptical that she had something sensational to tell at last.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hi, fellows!" [...] was the {{unexpected}} {{cry from the}} lower end of the campus. [...] "Here come the freshies and the sophs back! Line <b>up</b> <b>and</b> be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> receive them!" ...|$|R
25|$|Another trope of operas is the deus ex machina, {{in which}} the protagonist is saved {{at the last minute}} by divine intervention. This is a useful {{technique}} to quickly wrap up a story and make a happy ending, and has been used in drama many times. In Mahagonny, though there are no supernatural occurrences for most of the opera, there is in fact a deus ex machina; God himself comes to Mahagonny right before Jimmy is executed. The typical opera would have God solving all the problems {{just in time for the}} end of the opera, but Mahagonnys god does not. He does not even acknowledge that Jimmy is tied <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be killed, but at least tries to fix the moral problems in Mahagonny. He tries to convince them to give up their degraded way of life, but the residents all refuse the offer. God then tells them literally to go to hell, but the people are not even offended; they proclaim that they already are in hell so that is no punishment. After fixing nothing, God then lets Jimmy have his say. Jimmy realizes that money did not buy him happiness or freedom, and he has learned his lesson. However, God does not spare him even then, and Jimmy is executed off-stage.|$|E
500|$|So {{much time}} had been spent on [...] "screwdriver work" [...] that Eno {{thought it would be}} best to start from scratch. His idea was to [...] "stage an accident" [...] and have the song's tapes erased. He said that this was not to force {{abandonment}} of the song, but rather that it would be more effective to start again with a fresh performance. At one point, Eno had the tapes cued <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be recorded over, but this erasure never took place; according to engineer Flood, fellow engineer Pat McCarthy returned to the control room and upon seeing Eno ready to erase the tapes, dropped the tray of tea he was carrying and physically restrained Eno.|$|E
2500|$|Polling {{showed a}} tight {{race in the}} days leading up to the New Hampshire primary. All of the {{candidates}} barnstormed in New Hampshire during the four days after the Iowa caucuses, targeting undecided and independent voters in the state. The day before the election, polls conducted by CNN/WMUR, Rasmussen Reports and USA Today/Gallup showed Obama jumping ahead by 9, 10, and 13 points respectively. Despite the apparent surge of momentum, Clinton defeated Obama by a margin of 39.1 percent to 36.5 percent in the New Hampshire primary on January 8, 2008. Obama told supporters that he was [...] "still fired <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> go", echoing a theme of his campaign.|$|E

60|$|I drew myself <b>up</b> <b>and</b> made <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> wither this untruthful brawler with my best {{election}} scorn, when, of a sudden, I {{remembered the}} Red-headed Man, and {{passed on to}} the consideration of foreign affairs.|$|R

5000|$|Back home, Bink is put to bed by his family. As {{his parents}} discuss having his picture {{taken by a}} normal {{photographer}} in the morning, he wakes <b>up</b> <b>and</b> gets <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> read another book, this one entitled [...] "Baby's Trip to China".|$|R
60|$|John {{had just}} {{sat down in}} the porch in his clean Sunday smock with the baby on his knee, and Rusha {{clinging}} about him waiting till Stead had cleaned himself <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> read to them from the mother's books.|$|R
60|$|The shrill note of a steam-whistle {{was heard}} at this moment, its {{piercing}} sound rising {{high above the}} shriek of the gale and the roaring of the sea. It was a signal from the steam-tug appointed to attend on the lifeboat, and told that steam was <b>up</b> <b>and</b> all <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> put to sea.|$|R
60|$|He {{was almost}} on the {{antelope}} {{when he heard}} a warning whirr close at his side, and glancing hastily in that direction, saw the reptile but a few feet away, coiled <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> attack.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall tell mother, you know, Miss Mag," [...] said Tom, {{as soon as}} Lucy was <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> walk away. It was not Tom's {{practice}} to [...] "tell," [...] but here justice clearly demanded that Maggie should be visited with the utmost punishment.|$|E
60|$|She {{brought it}} to him and made him eat something; then, as {{he shut his eyes}} wearily, she went away to the piano and, having no heart to sing, played softly till he seemed asleep. But at the stroke of six he was <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be off again.|$|E
60|$|The old steward was, however, <b>up</b> <b>and</b> alert, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> {{offer the}} stirrup- cup, {{and the horses}} were waiting in the court; but what they had by no means {{expected}} or desired was that Duke Murdoch himself, in his long furred gown, came slowly across the hall to bid his young kinsman Kennedy farewell.|$|R
6000|$|As I stood <b>up,</b> booted <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> descend, {{there came}} a gentle tap at my door, and, in answer to my [...] "Enter," [...] there stood before me a very dainty and foppish figure.

5000|$|Miller {{said of the}} album, [...] "This is a party record, man. It's {{about getting}} <b>up</b> <b>and</b> getting <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> dance. It's like the {{fraternity}} party gigs I used to play in college. I went through and picked all my favorite tunes that I really, really loved. I wanted to make this record forever; it started off as {{just kind of a}} goof, and then it got real serious." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't mention it.

60|$|It {{was at a}} {{very early}} hour, therefore, that the boys were <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> {{continue}} the chase. As a matter of course, after having gone to bed supperless, they were ready for a hearty breakfast, and, since they would {{have plenty of time to}} eat it before sunrise, they at once made preparations for breaking their fast.|$|E
60|$|As {{they rode}} along the half-hidden trail, he {{questioned}} Dan Baxter {{more closely than}} ever, {{and as a result}} learned as much as he cared to know.

What he had possessed, he had spent in gambling and other forms of fast living.|$|E
50|$|With four authors, {{there are}} {{specific}} roles with each author. First, Holmes, who {{acts as the}} editor sends in the preliminary script and outline to Cary, Baldry, or Sutherland, depending on who writes the book. Then, the author develops Holmes' ideas into a single book which is sent back to Holmes for one last check over and edit. After she finishes, the author fixes it <b>up</b> <b>and</b> gets <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> publish it.|$|R

People who turn <b>up</b> <b>and</b> are <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> fight for something, like our young players are, I like. It's the X Factor Academy!" [...] Arsène Wenger, February 2007 ...|$|R
60|$|Before {{this war}} began {{speculative}} writers {{had argued that}} infantry drill in close formation had now no fighting value whatever, {{that it was no}} doubt extremely necessary for the handling, packing, forwarding and distribution of men, but that the ideal infantry fighter was now a highly individualised and self-reliant man put into a pit with a machine gun, and supported by a string of other men bringing him <b>up</b> supplies <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> assist him in any forward rush that might be necessary.|$|R
60|$|Cloaks were lent to the boys, {{and they}} were taken at once to the Residency, and along {{passages}} thronged with sleepers were conducted to Colonel Inglis' room.

6000|$|Early {{the next}} morning, a gentleman came to wait upon Mr. Lovel, who was <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> receive him.

6000|$|... "That's all right!" [...] was {{the cool}} answer. [...] "I expect the game's <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> I'm quite <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> buy them of you. By the way, partner, you helped your boss {{to pull me}} out, didn't you? As I said before, I'm not great on swimming." ...|$|R
50|$|A man {{learns that}} his last enemy has died. He gives <b>up</b> living, <b>and</b> is <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> die.

50|$|In 1795, at {{the time}} of his {{engagement}} to Duchess Louise Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Gustav IV Adolf fell in love with her. He offered her to end his engagement, abdicate and elope with her to Bohemia. He also had a document of abdication set <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> make use of it. She declined, and encouraged him on his trip to Russia in 1796, where he was to be engaged to the Grand Duchess Alexandra Pavlovna of Russia; the following year, he married Frederica of Baden.|$|R
