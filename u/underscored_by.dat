Unlike a melodramatic villain such as J. R.

5|$|The renewed {{interest}} in residential schools in the early 1800s {{has been linked to}} the decline in military hostility faced by British settlers, particularly after the War of 1812. With the threat of invasion by American forces minimized, Indigenous communities were no longer viewed as allies but as barriers to permanent settlement. This perspective was further <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> the transfer of affairs with Indigenous communities from military officials, familiar with and sympathetic to their customs and way of life, to civilian representatives concerned only with permanent colonial settlement.|$|E
5|$|During the Triassic {{period of}} some 251–199.6Ma, the Indian subcontinent {{was part of}} a vast supercontinent known as Pangaea. Despite its {{position}} within a high-latitude belt at 55–75°S—latitudes now occupied by parts of the Antarctic Peninsula, as opposed to India's current position between 5 and 35°N—India likely experienced a humid temperate climate with warm and frost-free weather, though with well-defined seasons. India later merged into the southern supercontinent Gondwana, a process beginning some 550–500Ma. During the Late Paleozoic, Gondwana extended from a point at or near the South Pole to near the equator, where the Indian craton (stable continental crust) was positioned, resulting in a mild climate favourable to hosting high-biomass ecosystems. This is <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> India's vast coal reserves—much of it from the late Paleozoic sedimentary sequence—the fourth-largest reserves in the world. During the Mesozoic, the world, including India, was considerably warmer than today. With the coming of the Carboniferous, global cooling stoked extensive glaciation, which spread northwards from South Africa towards India; this cool period lasted well into the Permian.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{overwhelming}} British victory in the climactic battle, the campaign has sometimes been considered a strategic success for France. Historian Edward Ingram noted that if Nelson had successfully intercepted Bonaparte at sea as ordered, the ensuing battle could have annihilated both the French fleet and the transports. As it was, Bonaparte was free to continue {{the war in the}} Middle East and later to return to Europe personally unscathed. The potential of a successful engagement at sea to change the course of history is <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> the list of French army officers carried aboard the convoy who later formed the core of the generals and marshals under Emperor Napoleon. In addition to Bonaparte himself, Louis-Alexandre Berthier, Auguste de Marmont, Jean Lannes, Joachim Murat, Louis Desaix, Jean Reynier, Antoine-François Andréossy, Jean-Andoche Junot, Louis-Nicolas Davout and Dumas were all passengers on the cramped Mediterranean crossing.|$|E
5|$|Killer Instinct Gold is a 1996 {{fighting}} {{video game}} {{based on the}} arcade game Killer Instinct2. The game was developed by Rare and released by Nintendo for the Nintendo64 video game console. As in other series entries, players control characters who fight on a 2D plane set against a 3D background. Players press buttons to punch and kick their opponent in chains of successive hits, known as combos. Large combo successions lead to stronger attacks and brutal, stylistic finisher moves <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> an announcer. Charactersincluding a gargoyle, a ninja, and a femme fatalefight in settings such as a jungle and a spaceship. Killer Instinct Gold includes the arcade release's characters, combos, and 3D, pre-rendered environments, but excludes its full-motion video sequences and some voiceovers due to restrictions of the cartridge media format. The Gold release adds a training mode, new camera views, and improved audiovisuals.|$|E

40|$|The newly {{introduced}} Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), which {{relies on}} a single largest dimension of tumor {{rather than on the}} product of perpendicular diameters World Health Organisation (WHO) is intended to simplify the assessment of tumor response. PURPOSE: Is to evaluate the performance and validity of the RECIST compared to the WHO criteria. DESIGN: Thirty-four consecutive patients with bidimensionally measurable malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) were evaluated prospectively. RESULTS: In 27 % (9 / 34) a discrepancy was found between the WHO and RECIST response evaluation 9 % (3 / 34) concerned best responses and 18 % (6 / 34) objective confirmed responses. In 24 % (8 / 34) disease progression was missed by RECIST. The percentage of patients in whom one or more discordance's between WHO and RECIST were detected was 47, 88 % due to <b>underscoring</b> <b>by</b> RECIST. In a subgroup of 24 MPM patients with bidimensionally measurable pleural lesions only, the discrepancy rate was 29 %, always due to <b>underscoring</b> <b>by</b> RECIST. However, when in the same subgroup the modified RECIST response evaluation was used the discrepancy rate was 21 % and in all cases due to <b>underscoring</b> <b>by</b> WHO. CONCLUSION: For MPM bidimensional WHO response evaluation cannot automatically be replaced by RECIST because MPM has a non-spherical growth pattern. Our recommendation is to use the WHO criteria for bidimensional measurable lesions, RECIST for unidimensional measurable lesions and a modified RECIST response evaluation, in which the short axis perpendicular to the chest wall is used, for thickened pleural rind disease, according to the method used in the recently completed pemetrexed (Alimta) trial for MPM...|$|R

The importance of this direct link between the helicase and the leading-strand polymerase is <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> results in cultured human cells, where Mrc1/Claspin is required for efficient replication fork progression. These results suggest that efficient DNA replication also requires the coupling of helicases and leading-strand synthesis...|$|E

5000|$|Moses was {{published}} in the New Directions anthology Five Young American Poets in 1940, his first book, alongside John Berryman, Randall Jarrell, Mary Barnard and George Marion O'Donnell. His poetry was received rather coolly by reviewers who talk of [...] "limp regularity of the lines... little striving to concentrate by means of metaphor, to <b>underscore</b> <b>by</b> a change of cadence, or to thrust home by climax..." [...] and [...] "baffling... unrelieved particularity in verse... He does not generalize, or generalizes barely, or generalizes badly... But since most young poets generalize too easily... his bias is exceptional and something should come of it." ...|$|R

25|$|In {{the second}} series of DSDS 2003–2004, co-hosts Hunziker and Spengemann and all four jury members reprised their engagements in the show. Following {{the success of}} the first installment, the second season was aired to a higher profile during 2003 fall schedule, {{including}} an increased number of episodes, budgets and charges for commercial spots. In contrast to the first season, however, the second soon found its main audience but never reached the overwhelming hype and demand which the first season had captured. This fact was <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> decreasing phone votes and ratings, which were released after the show's final.|$|E

The 1998 Concorde differed far greater from the Dodge Intrepid and the new 1999 Chrysler 300M (successor to the Eagle Vision), than did the first generation models. With the exception of the doors and roof, the Concorde shared little sheetmetal with the Intrepid and 300M. The new Concorde's front end was <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> a striking full-width grille, relocated to the front bumper to give the impression of a bottom breather. Sweeping curves and a more rounded front end also helped set the Concorde apart from the Intrepid and 300M.|$|E
25|$|Their {{presence}} severely {{exacerbated the}} differences among American Quakers, differences that had been <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> the 1819 split between the Unitarians and Congregationalists. The influence of Anna Braithwaite was especially strong. She visited the United States between 1823 and 1827 and published her Letters and observations relating to the controversy respecting the doctrines of Elias Hicks in 1824 in which she depicted Hicks as a radical eccentric. Hicks felt obliged to respond {{and in the same}} year published a letter to his ally in Philadelphia Meeting, Dr. Edwin Atlee, in The Misrepresentations of Anna Braithwaite. This in turn was replied to by Braithwaite in A Letter from Anna Braithwaite to Elias Hicks, On the Nature of his Doctrines in 1825. Neither party was persuaded by this exchange.|$|E

25|$|A {{daughter}} (July 1717). The Duchess {{had retired}} at the Château de la Muette {{to hide the}} term of her pregnancy. The putative father Sicaire Antonin Armand Auguste Nicolas d'Aydie, Chevalier de Rion, became Berry's lover sometime in 1716 or 1717. In his additions to the diary of Dangeau on 21 July 1719, Saint-Simon mentions that the Duchess had managed to hide a first pregnancy by Rion, bringing forth a girl. She was not so fortunate the second time when she almost died in labour at the Luxembourg and provoked a public scandal, as <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> Saint-Simon who then writes a short description of Berry's 1719 childbirth which has become the most-well known episode of her scandalous biography. According to Duclos, this child subsequently became a nun at the Abbey of Pontoise.|$|E
25|$|The lyrics for the band's {{songs were}} often pleas for peace, love, and {{understanding}} among people. These calls against prejudice and self-hate were <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> the band's on-stage appearance. Caucasians Gregg Errico and Jerry Martini {{were members of}} the band at a time when integrated performance bands were virtually unknown; integration had only recently become enforced by law. Females Cynthia Robinson and Rosie Stone played instruments onstage, rather than just providing vocals or serving as visual accompaniment for the male members. The band's gospel-styled singing endeared them to black audiences; their rock music elements and wild costuming—including Sly's large Afro and tight leather outfits, Rose's blond wig, and the other members' loud psychedelic clothing—caught the attention of mainstream audiences, and helped the group enjoy success as a pop act.|$|E
25|$|In {{economic}} terms {{the division of}} the Three Kingdoms reflected a reality that long endured. Even during the Northern Song dynasty, 700 years after the Three Kingdoms period, it was possible to think of China as being composed of three great regional markets. (The status of the northwest was slightly ambivalent, as it had links with the northern region and Sichuan). These geographical divisions are <b>underscored</b> <b>by</b> the fact that the main communication routes between the three main regions were all man-made: the Grand Canal linking north and south, the hauling-way through the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River linking southern China with Sichuan and the gallery roads joining Sichuan with the northwest. The break into three separate entities was quite natural and even anticipated by such political foresight as that of Zhuge Liang (see Longzhong Plan).|$|E
