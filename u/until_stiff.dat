50|$|New Boots and Panties!! is {{the debut}} album by Ian Dury, {{released}} in the UK on Stiff Records on 30 September 1977. Usually {{thought of as the}} first album by Ian Dury and the Blockheads (his backing band from 1977 to 1982), the album is credited solely to Dury as the Blockheads were not officially formed <b>until</b> <b>Stiff's</b> 'Live Stiffs' package tour the month after its release, and two members of the Blockheads do not play on the album. Although it is often cited {{as one of the first}} classic UK punk albums, the record covers a diverse range of musical styles reflecting Dury's influences and background in pub rock, taking in funk, disco, British music hall and early rock and roll, courtesy of Dury's musical hero Gene Vincent. Dury's lyrics also eschew the anti-establishment stance associated with punk music, preferring cheeky love songs or character stories based on the working-class people of the East End and Essex Estuary areas where he grew up. The songs are frequently ribald and profane, but also contain humour and affection for his characters.|$|R

For Beat <b>Until</b> <b>Stiff,</b> TQ had taken over as full-time lead singer for the band (though Sluggo sings on the tune [...] "Taskmaster" [...] and hidden track [...] "Sea of Trash"), and his vocals that range from a growl to a scream begin to characterize the bands sound.

[...] But with the songs [...] "Beat Until Stiff" [...] and [...] "Gotta Go" [...] some slower tempos and heavier guitars are introduced, giving the album a proto-grunge feel. The trademark trumpet and saxophone solos are still present throughout. Kris Fell, in the Boston Phoenix said that the [...] "lyrics on Beat <b>Until</b> <b>Stiff</b> are blunt, almost photographic representation of the grotesque..."

50|$|To avoid {{needing to}} do an {{expensive}} implicit solution {{of a system of}} ODEs, many real-time cloth simulators (notably PhysX, Havok Cloth, and Maya nCloth) use position based dynamics (PBD), an approach based on constraint relaxation. The mass-spring model is converted into a system of constraints, which demands that the distance between the connected nodes be equal to the initial distance. This system is solved sequentially and iteratively, by directly moving nodes to satisfy each constraint, <b>until</b> sufficiently <b>stiff</b> cloth is obtained. This is similar to a Gauss-Seidel solution of the implicit matrix system for the mass-spring model. Care must be taken though to solve the constraints in the same sequence each timestep, to avoid spurious oscillations, {{and to make sure that}} the constraints do not violate linear and angular momentum conservation. Additional position constraints can be applied, for example to keep the nodes within desired regions of space (sufficiently close to an animated model for example), or to maintain the body's overall shape via shape matching.|$|R

50|$|Instead of the {{traditional}} cake ingredient butter or paste (such as shortening), vegetable oil is used; but this is difficult to beat enough air into.

50|$|There are {{indications}} that frozen grapes were used to make wine in Roman times. Pliny the Elder (AD 23 - 79) wrote that certain grape varieties were not harvested before the first frost had occurred. The poet Martial recommended that grapes should be left on the vine until November or <b>until</b> they were <b>stiff</b> with frost. Details as to the winemaking and description of these wines are unknown. It cannot be completely ruled out that the descriptions refer to dried grape wines, a common style of wine in Roman times, where the raisin-like grapes were harvested late enough for the first frost to have fallen. In either case, the method seems later to have been forgotten. Wine from Chiomonte in the Val di Susa was popular in Roman times and this town still today produces one of Italy's few ice wines.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the unusually}} high speeds {{at which the}} Supermarine Spitfire could dive, this problem of aileron {{reversal}} became apparent when it was wished to increase the lateral maneuverability (rate of roll) by increasing the aileron area. The aircraft had a wing designed originally for an aileron reversal airspeed of 580 mph, and any attempt to increase the aileron area {{would have resulted in}} the wing twisting when the larger ailerons were applied at high speed, the aircraft then rolling in the opposite direction to that intended by the pilot. The problem of increasing the rate of roll was temporarily alleviated with the introduction of [...] "clipped" [...] wing tips (to reduce the aerodynamic load on the tip area, allowing larger ailerons to be used) <b>until</b> a new, <b>stiffer</b> wing could be incorporated.This new wing was introduced in the Mark XXI and had a theoretical aileron reversal speed of 825 mi/h km/h.|$|R
5000|$|The five {{original}} {{songs on}} the EP show that the transition started with Beat <b>Until</b> <b>Stiff</b> had completed, as band's sound had moved away from punk, more fully into the territory of grunge. The extra guitar makes for a much heavier sound, and the tempos are slower and songs longer that on previous releases. Nonetheless, the band continued to experiment with unusual song forms and odd meters. And the unusual instrumentation comes to the forefront: the song [...] "Die Laughing" [...] begins with a prominent, blaring trumpet solo, and [...] "Curse of Civilization" [...] features TQ on an extended sax solo as well.|$|E

The band's lineup had changed significantly since their previous release, Beat <b>Until</b> <b>Stiff.</b> Their previous bass player (Pete Foley) had left the band. He was replaced on bass by former drummer John Quinn, who was in turn replaced on drums by Chris Rossow. In addition, the band added a second guitar player, Kevin James, formerly of noise-rock instrumental band The Loving Six. James also produced the recording.|$|E
5000|$|The drink {{crossed the}} Atlantic to the British colonies during the 18th century. Since brandy and wine were heavily taxed, rum from the Triangular Trade with the Caribbean was a {{cost-effective}} substitute. The inexpensive liquor, coupled with plentiful farm {{and dairy products}} available to colonists, helped the drink become very popular in America. When the supply of rum to the newly founded United States was reduced {{as a consequence of}} the American Revolutionary War, Americans turned to domestic whiskey, and eventually bourbon in particular, as a substitute. In places in the American colonies where even bourbon was too expensive, homemade moonshine spirits were added to eggnog.

5000|$|The {{history of}} the {{development}} of the technology of raw material grinding defines the early history of cement technology. Other stages of cement manufacture used existing technology in the early days. Early hydraulic materials such as hydraulic limes, natural cements and Parker's Roman cement were all based on [...] "natural" [...] raw materials, burned [...] "as-dug". Because these natural blends of minerals occur only rarely, manufacturers were interested in making a fine-grained artificial mixture of readily available minerals such as limestone and clay {{that could be used in}} the same way. A typical problem would be to make an intimate mixture of 75% chalk and 25% clay, and burn this to produce an ”artificial cement". The development of the [...] "wet" [...] method of producing fine-grained clay in the ceramics industry afforded a means of doing this. For this reason, the early cement industry used the [...] "wet process", in which the raw materials are ground together with water, to produce a slurry, containing 20-50% water. Both Louis Vicat and James Frost used this technique in the early 19th century, and it remained the only way of making rawmix for Portland cement until 1890. A modification of the technique used by the early industry was [...] "double-burning", in which a hard limestone would be burned and slaked before combining with clay slurry. This technique avoided the grinding of hard stone, and was employed by, among others, Joseph Aspdin. Early grinding technology was poor, and early slurries were made thin, with a high water content. The slurry was then allowed to stand in large reservoirs ("slurry-backs") for several weeks. Large, un-ground particles would drop to the bottom, and excess water rose to the top. The water was periodically decanted <b>until</b> a <b>stiff</b> cake, of the consistency of pottery clay, was left. This was sliced up, discarding the coarse material at the bottom, and burned in the kiln. Wet grinding is comparatively energy-efficient, and so when good dry-grinding equipment became available, the wet process continued in use throughout the 20th century, often employing equipment that Josiah Wedgwood would have recognized.|$|R
40|$|With {{operating}} anvil hammers, {{there are}} rigid impacts of die tools, {{and as a}} result, almost instantaneous impact stops of the falling parts of hammer. Such operating conditions lead to the accelerated breakdowns of rods because of significant wave stresses arising in them. Common differential and integral methods to estimate wave stresses are widespread in engineering practice. However, to use them a researcher has to possess certain skills and special software. We consider the method for estimating the wave stresses in the rods of anvil hammers based on Laplace transforms (LT) of wave equation. The article shows a procedure {{to set up and}} solve differential wave equations by operator method. These equations describe the wave propagation process of strains and stresses in the rods of anvil hammers with rigid impact and taking into account a damping rod connection with the head of hammer. The method takes into consideration an influence of both piston and rod weights and of mechanical and geometrical characteristics of rod on the stress value in the placement of rod in hammer head. Results analysis shows that a sufficiently efficient method for practical improving the durability of rods is the method of damping impact load on the rod through setting the damping devices in the form either of elastic "pad" of one or another design or of hydraulic shock absorbers in the placement of its connection with the hammer head. In this case there is a change of the wave front, it becomes flatter. It is shown that the stresses in the rod are proportional to the amount of wave stresses because of the own impact of rod and piston, which make a total weight of the system. Effect of piston weight on the stresses value at the rod during impact is directly proportional to the ratio of its weight to the rod weight. The geometric parameters of rod and the speed of the falling parts before the impact also influence on the value of stresses in the rod. The represented method of the stresses analysis can be successfully applied to the selection of optimal weights and the geometric parameters of the piston and rod during rigid impact of falling parts without damping and taking into account the energy dissipation <b>until</b> the <b>stiff</b> stop of falling parts of the anvil hammer. </p...|$|R
