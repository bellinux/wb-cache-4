5000|$|In geometry, a monostatic polytope (or <b>unistable</b> polyhedron) is a d-polytope which [...] "can {{stand on}} only one face". They were {{described}} in 1969 by J.H. Conway, M. Goldberg and R.K. Guy. The monostatic polytope in 3-space they constructed has 19 faces. In 2012, Andras Bezdek has discovered an 18 face solution and, in 2014, Alex Reshetov has published a 14 face object.|$|E
5000|$|Guy {{is one of}} the {{key people}} in the field of {{recreational}} mathematics. In 1998 Martin Gardner wrote, [...] "Conway later collaborated with fellow mathematicians Richard Guy and Elwyn Berlekamp on what I consider the greatest contribution to recreational mathematics in this century, a two-volume work called Winning Ways." [...] In fact, Guy was briefly considered as a replacement for Gardner when the latter retired from the Mathematical Games column at Scientific American. Along with Bill Gosper, Guy has been one of the principal researchers in John H. Conway's Game of Life, and in 1970 discovered the glider, one of the key discoveries in that field. Around 1959, Guy discovered a <b>unistable</b> polyhedron having only 19 faces; no such construct with fewer faces was found until 2012. As of 2016 Guy is still very active mathematically. To mark his 100th birthday friends and colleagues organised a celebration of his life and a tribute song and video was released by Gathering 4 Gardner.|$|E
40|$|First {{published}} on the web 8 th April 2009 We present a simple, unifying theory for stochastic biochemical systems with multiple time-scale dynamics that exhibit noise-induced bistability in an open-chemical environment, while the corresponding macroscopic reaction is <b>unistable.</b> Nonlinear stochastic biochemical systems like these are fundamentally different from classical systems in equilibrium or near-equilibrium steady state whose fluctuations are unimodal following Einstein–Onsager–Lax–Keizer theory. We show that noise-induced bistability in general arises from slow fluctuations, and a pitchfork bifurcation occurs as the rate of fluctuations decreases. Since an equilibrium distribution, due to detailed balance, has to be independent of changes in time-scale, the bifurcation is necessarily a driven phenomenon. As examples, we analyze three biochemical networks of currently interest: self-regulating gene, stochastic binary decision, and phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle with fluctuating kinase. The implications of bistability to biochemical complexity are discussed. 1...|$|E
40|$|Ductile {{materials}} can absorb spikes in mechanical force, whereas brittle ones fail catastrophically. Here we develop a theory {{to quantify the}} kinetic ductility of single molecules from force spectroscopy experiments, relating force-spike resistance to the differential responses of the intact protein and the unfolding transition state to an applied mechanical force. We introduce a class of <b>unistable</b> one-dimensional potential surfaces that encompass previous models as special cases and continuously cover the entire range from ductile to brittle. Compact analytic expressions for force-dependent rates and rupture-force distributions allow us to analyze force-clamp and force-ramp pulling experiments. We find that the force-transmitting protein domains of filamin and titin are kinetically ductile when pulled from their two termini, making them resistant to force spikes. For the mechanostable muscle protein titin, a highly ductile model reconciles data over 10 orders of magnitude in force loading rate from experiment and simulation...|$|E
40|$|Under steady laser illumination, {{aperiodic}} spatio-temporal oscillations {{are observed}} in the light transmitted and reflected by parallel-sided samples of the ferroelectrics PMN (lead magnesium niobate, Pb(Mg 1 / 3 Nb 2 / 3) O 3), PLZT (lanthanum doped lead zirconium titanate, Pb(Zr 1 -xTix) O 3 :La), BNN (barium sodium niobate, Ba 2 NaNb 5 O 15) and Ce:SBN (cerium doped strontium barium niobate, Ce 3 +:SrxBa 1 -xNb 2 O 6). There are two distinct mechanisms for such oscillations, namely (1) <b>unistable</b> thermal focusing oscillations, which occur in BNN and Ce:SBN and (2) bistable or multistable Fabry-Perot switching oscillations, as observed in PMN and PLZT. The two types of oscillation have characteristic time scales differing by several orders of magnitude. We derive temperature profiles {{as a function of}} incident laser power, beamwidth and sample thickness, which quantitatively predict the spatio-temporal characteristics of the transmitted beam patterns...|$|E
