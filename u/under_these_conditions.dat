5|$|Angel sharks {{in general}} are highly {{threatened}} by commercial trawl fisheries due to their susceptibility to capture and low rate of reproduction, and angel shark species elsewhere {{are known to have}} declined markedly under fishing pressure. Trawling activity in the Yellow Sea {{and other parts of the}} northwestern Pacific is intense and, coupled with pollution, has had a serious impact on the local ecosystem. The Japanese angelshark population is suspected to have declined by up to 50% or more <b>under</b> <b>these</b> <b>conditions,</b> leading the species to be assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It may benefit from a ban on trawling imposed in some areas by the Chinese government, though enforcement is inconsistent.|$|E
5|$|Rainfall in the {{dry zone}} of Sri Lanka is limited to 50-75inches. <b>Under</b> <b>these</b> <b>conditions,</b> rain fed {{cultivation}} was difficult, forcing early settlers to develop means to store water {{in order to maintain}} a constant supply of water for their cultivations. Small irrigation tanks were constructed at village level, to support the cultivations of that village. The earliest medium-scale irrigation tank is the Basawakkulama reservoir built by King Pandukabhaya. Nuwara wewa and Tissa Wewa reservoirs were constructed a century later. These reservoirs were enlarged in subsequent years by various rulers.|$|E

5|$|Slow-tight {{inhibition}} {{occurs when}} the initial enzyme–inhibitor complex EI undergoes isomerisation to a second more tightly held complex, EI*, but the overall inhibition process is reversible. This manifests itself as slowly increasing enzyme inhibition. <b>Under</b> <b>these</b> <b>conditions,</b> traditional Michaelis–Menten kinetics give a false value for Ki, which is time–dependent. The true value of Ki can be obtained through more complex analysis of the on (kon) and off (koff) rate constants for inhibitor association. See irreversible inhibition below for more information.|$|E
5|$|Speciation {{has been}} {{observed}} multiple times under both controlled laboratory conditions and in nature. In sexually reproducing organisms, speciation results from reproductive isolation followed by genealogical divergence. There are four primary geographic modes of speciation. The most common in animals is allopatric speciation, which occurs in populations initially isolated geographically, such as by habitat fragmentation or migration. Selection <b>under</b> <b>these</b> <b>conditions</b> can produce very rapid changes in the appearance and behaviour of organisms. As selection and drift act independently on populations isolated {{from the rest of}} their species, separation may eventually produce organisms that cannot interbreed.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuous}} {{shadows in}} the south polar craters cause the floors of these formations to maintain a temperature that never exceeds about 100K. For Shackleton, the average temperature {{was determined to be}} about 90K, reaching 88K at the crater floor. <b>Under</b> <b>these</b> <b>conditions,</b> the estimated rate of loss from any ice in the interior would be 10−26 to 10−27m/s. Any water vapor that arrives here following a cometary impact on the Moon would lie permanently frozen on or below the surface. However, the surface albedo of the crater floor matches the lunar far-side, suggesting that there is no exposed surface ice.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{recorded}} incidents of CFM56 engines flaming out in heavy rain and/or hail conditions, beginning {{early in the}} CFM56's career. In 1987, a double flameout occurred in hail conditions (the pilots managed to relight the engines), followed by the TACA Flight 110 incident in 1988. Both CFM56 engines on the TACA 737 flamed out while passing through hail and heavy rain, and the crew was forced to land without engines on a grassy levee near New Orleans, Louisiana. CFMI modified the engines by adding a sensor to force the combustor to continuously ignite <b>under</b> <b>these</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, {{both sides}} wished for a decisive battle that would tip {{the war in}} their favor. However, Lazenby {{believed}} that Mardonius' actions during the Plataea campaign were not consistent with an aggressive policy. He interprets the Persian operations during the prelude not as attempts to force the Allies into battle but as attempts to force the Allies into retreat (which indeed became the case). Mardonius may have felt he had little to gain in battle {{and that he could}} simply wait for the Greek alliance to fall apart (as it had nearly done over the winter). There can be little doubt from Herodotus' account that Mardonius was prepared to accept battle on his own terms, however. Regardless of the exact motives, the initial strategic situation allowed both sides to procrastinate, since food supplies were ample for both armies. <b>Under</b> <b>these</b> <b>conditions,</b> the tactical considerations outweighed the strategic need for action.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} eggs laid depends on species, with batch sizes ranging {{from two to}} several dozen. The total number of eggs {{produced}} in a female's lifetime (fecundity) varies from around one hundred to several thousand. In some species, the flea lives in the nest or burrow and the eggs are deposited on the substrate, but in others, the eggs are laid on the host itself and can easily fall off onto the ground. Because of this, areas where the host rests and sleeps {{become one of the}} primary habitats of eggs and developing larvae. The eggs take around two days to two weeks to hatch. Experiments have shown that fleas lay more eggs on hosts which have limited food intakes, and that eggs and larvae survive better <b>under</b> <b>these</b> <b>conditions,</b> perhaps because the host's immune system is compromised.|$|E

40|$|The {{inhibition}} of copper corrosion by 1, 3, 4 -thiadiazole- 2, 5 -dithiol (bismuthiol), under 0. 5 M HCl at 25 C, was studied {{by means of}} the potentiodynamic polarization technique. It was found that bismuthiol was chemically adsorbed on the copper surface, and follows a Langmuir isotherm. The inhibition mechanism was found to be mixed, and it was originated through the formation of bismutiol-copper complexes {{on the surface of the}} metal. Bismuthiol shows good inhibition efficiency <b>under</b> <b>these</b> <b>condition...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{resistor}} {{is perhaps}} the simplest of passive circuit elements: as its name suggests, it resists the current through it, dissipating its energy as heat. The resistance {{is a consequence of}} the motion of charge through a conductor: in metals, for example, resistance is primarily due to collisions between electrons and ions. Ohm's law is a basic law of circuit theory, stating that the current passing through a resistance is directly proportional to the potential difference across it. The resistance of most materials is relatively constant over a range of temperatures and currents; materials <b>under</b> <b>these</b> <b>conditions</b> are known as 'ohmic'. The ohm, the unit of resistance, was named in honour of Georg Ohm, and is symbolised by the Greek letter Ω. 1Ω is the resistance that will produce a potential difference of one volt in response to a current of one amp.|$|E
5|$|The Latin American wars of {{independence}} had repercussions in Puerto Rico; due to widespread privateering and other naval warfare, maritime commerce suffered heavily. Cabo Rojo {{was among the}} municipalities affected most, with its ports at a virtual standstill. African slaves took to the sea in an attempt at freedom; merchants were assessed higher taxes and harassed by foreigners. <b>Under</b> <b>these</b> <b>conditions,</b> Cofresí was born to Francisco and María Germana. The youngest of four children, he had one sister (Juana) and two brothers (Juan Francisco and Ignacio). Cofresí was baptized into the Catholic Church by José de Roxas, the first priest in Cabo Rojo, when he was fifteen days old. María died when Cofresí was four years old, and an aunt assumed his upbringing. Francisco then began a relationship with María Sanabria, {{the mother of his}} last child Julián. A don by birth, Cofresí's education was above average; since {{there is no evidence of}} a school in Cabo Rojo at that time, Francisco may have educated his children or hired a tutor. The Cofresís, raised in a multicultural environment, probably knew Dutch and Italian. In November 1814 Francisco died, leaving a modest estate; Roberto was probably homeless, with no income.|$|E
