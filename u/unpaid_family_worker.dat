For this aim, we utilized from {{the definition of}} self-employment in TURKSTAT’s Household Labor Force Surveys (HLFS), where self-employment covers three groups of individuals, namely, employer, own-account worker and unpaid-family workers. The data set is obtained from the raw data of Household Labor Force Surveys of 2006 - 2007 and 2008. In order to analyze the data, the multinomial-logit model is used and estimated by maximum likelihood estimation method. Main findings of this analysis are as the following. We find that living in the urban areas {{increases the likelihood of}} being employer, but decreases the likelihood of being own-account worker as well as <b>unpaid</b> <b>family</b> <b>worker,</b> as compared to the base category of wage-employed individuals. Also, being female declines the likelihood of being in the self-employment types. Further, being married increases the probability of being employer and own-account worker, while it declines the probability of being <b>unpaid</b> <b>family</b> <b>worker.</b> In addition, being head of household increases the likelihood of being employer, but it declines the likelihood of being own-account worker and <b>unpaid</b> <b>family</b> <b>worker,</b> as compared to the base group. Furthermore, increases in age continuously increase the probability of being employer, while there is a U-shaped relation between age and being <b>unpaid</b> <b>family</b> <b>worker,</b> compared to the base group of wage-employed. As compared to non-graduates the probability of being employer is lower for vocational high school and university graduates, while the same probability is higher for B. Darıcı & H. M.

30|$|The survey does collect {{information}} {{on all three}} key areas of interest for this paper: education, work and childbirth/marriage. Given {{the nature of the}} DHS surveys, with its major focus on collecting data on demographics and health-related issues, they are an excellent source of precise information on childbirth and marriage/cohabitation. But the surveys also collect a range of additional relevant information beyond demographics and health. For instance, the surveys collect the level of completed education and current educational attendance is collected for all individuals, and respondents are asked to read a card to assess literacy. All individuals are asked if they currently work, and some limited information is collected about that work including the occupation, the employment status (self-employed, <b>unpaid</b> <b>family</b> <b>worker,</b> employee outside the household) and whether it is seasonal. All this information is available for both men and women, based on essentially the same questions.|$|E
30|$|As we have {{established}} from the descriptive analysis, different labor market statuses {{in the base}} year have very different probabilities of alignment. The worst alignment is {{for those who were}} unemployed in the base year, most of whom did not report that they were unemployed at that time in the retrospective data. The next worst alignment is for all the non-wage statuses (employer, self-employed, and <b>unpaid</b> <b>family</b> <b>worker).</b> The probability of misalignment is even higher for women in these categories than for men. This result is due to the difficulty in measuring these employment states for women, since they generally do not consider such work to be employment. Irregular wage work, as discussed above, also has poor alignment, because of the shifting nature of such a status and the difficulty in detecting when such shifts occur. Formal and informal private wage work also have a higher probability of misalignment relative to public sector work, again, more so for women than for men. Being out of the labor force is a base state that results in more misalignment for men and no misalignment for women. This difference is because it is a rare state for adult males and the most predominant state for women.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{consequences}} of the increasing informalisation of the Kenyan economy in the 1990 s for the gender gap in occupational outcomes. We use a labour force survey for Kenya undertaken {{at the end of the}} 1990 s to ask whether education acts to increase womens labour force participation and how both education and experience impact on the choices across the formal and informal sectors. We find that while labour force participation does rise with education it was higher for women than for men at the end of the 1990 s. There are major differences between the public and formal private sectors. At very high levels of education women are more likely than men to have a public sector job. In contrast for the private formal sector, while education does raise the probability of having such a job, the gap between women and men widens as educational levels increase. At eight years of education, the end of primary school in Kenya, women are 10 percentage points less likely to have an informal private sector job than are men and are 22 percentage points more likely to be an <b>unpaid</b> <b>family</b> <b>worker.</b> Clearly an expansion of private sector activity will not lessen the gender gap unless this pattern is altered.

3000|$|The main {{analysis}} of this paper relies on the last three waves (1997, 2000, 2007) of the Indonesian Familiy Life Survey (IFLS), a longitudinal survey on the individual, household, and community level. Besides its extremely low attrition rate (Strauss et al. 2009), the great advantage of the IFLS compared to datasets such as Sakernas is that it includes data on labor market outcomes for the self-employed. The data set for the employment regressions includes 48, 030 observations of 18, 825 active or inactive individuals (excluding students and sick or retired individuals) of working age (between 15 and 60 years) who appear at least twice in adjacent survey waves. Individuals are considered “active” if they report to be employed (as self-employed, government worker, private worker, <b>unpaid</b> <b>family</b> <b>worker,</b> casual worker in agriculture, casual worker not in agriculture) or mention “work” as their primary activity. On the contrary, individuals are inactive if they report a primary activity other than work 6 and neither report work status, or salary or profit. In addition to the classification in “active” and “inactive,” the reported work status helps us to categorize active individuals into “formal” or “informal.” That is, we distinguish formal from informal workers by employment type, i.e., classifying those workers as formal that are either private or government workers and as informal those workers who report “self-employed” or “unpaid family worker” as their working status. 7 [...]...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Occupational {{injuries}} {{have received}} limited research {{attention in the}} Southern African Development Community. Much of the published data come from South Africa and little has been reported elsewhere within the region. The present {{study was conducted to}} estimate the prevalence rates of occupational injuries and compensation; and to determine factors associated with occupational injuries and compensation. Methods Data were obtained from occupational health and injury questions added to the Zambian Labour Force Survey of 2009 by the Work and Health in Southern Africa programme. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the degree of association between demographic, social and economic factors on one hand and injury and compensation on the other. Results Data on 61871 study participants were available for analysis, of whom 4998 (8. 1 %) reported having been injured (10. 0 % of males, and 6. 2 % of females) due to work in the previous 12 months to the survey. Of those injured, 60. 5 % reported having stayed away from work as a result. The commonest type of injury was "open wound" (81. 6 %). Male gender, being married or married before, being a paid employee, working for a private company and household were positively associated with serious injuries. Injuries also varied by geographical area. Factors positively associated with receiving compensation for work-related injuries were: male gender, Copperbelt and North-Western provinces, and <b>unpaid</b> <b>family</b> <b>worker.</b> Employer/self employed and having less than 5 employees in a workplace were negatively associated with compensation. Conclusion The prevalence of reported injury and its association with a significant level of absence from work, indicate that occupational hazards in Zambia have significant health and economic effects. Female workers should equally be compensated for injuries suffered as their male counterparts. </p...|$|E
30|$|We made {{a serious}} {{attempt to take}} into account that “wages” for unpaid family members in {{informal}} household enterprises are not observed. To estimate the effects of the minimum wage on informal sector pay, we therefore propose three different specifications. In the first specification, we assume zero wages for unpaid family workers and use our standard log specification, i.e., family workers are not taken into account. We then estimate this equation in levels so that these workers actually enter the regression. This estimate {{can be thought of as}} a lower bound estimate on the effects of the minimum wage on informal sector pay. At least this estimate would capture an effect that depresses informal sector pay by increasing the number of unpaid family workers assumed to earn nothing at all. In turn, our third specification can be seen as an upper bound estimate of the effects of the minimum wage. Here, we impute a wage for unpaid family workers, and we do so in different ways to test for robustness. The first imputation procedure is based on a simple “wage regression” for all employed individuals, and we insert predicted wages into (log and level) specifications as before. The second more sophisticated imputation procedure tries to account for the heterogeneity of family enterprises. In addition to the wage equation for all employed individuals, we also estimate an income equation only for the self-employed. We then use the residual of this equation to rank the “family businesses” (with the residual being interpreted as the productivity of observed income determinants). We then assign to each <b>unpaid</b> <b>family</b> <b>worker</b> a residual from the observed distribution of residuals (for all employed) in accordance with the rank of the business. Simply put, we hence assume that individuals that work as unpaid family members in family businesses with high reported self-employment income are assumed to earn a higher implicit wage.|$|E
30|$|Our goal is {{to provide}} an {{analysis}} {{similar to that of}} Smith and Welch (1989). Toward that end, we make many data-use decisions that parallel theirs, though there are differences that we outline here. Like Smith and Welch we restrict our analysis to workers who work at least 27 weeks. As for age restrictions, Smith and Welch consider men aged 16 to 64. We are concerned about the growth of enrollment in high school and college, and {{we do not want to}} worry about decisions of “early retirement,” so we limit our analysis to men 25 to 55 inclusive. To deal with the issue of schooling, Smith and Welch drop men from their sample who are enrolled in school if they work less than 50 weeks a year. Given our age restrictions, we find that adjustment to be unnecessary. Smith and Welch exclude <b>unpaid</b> <b>family</b> <b>workers,</b> military personnel, and the self-employed who are not in the agricultural industry. We also exclude <b>unpaid</b> <b>family</b> <b>workers,</b> military personnel, the self-employed, and all agricultural workers 21.|$|R

40|$|In 1995 {{a severe}} {{economic}} crisis erupted in Mexico, reducing the GDP 7. 5 % during that year. The recovery was rather quickly and during 1997 the GDP grew again 7 %. In this paper {{we examine the}} transitions between occupational states taking place in Mexico during this period. Using data from the Encuesta Nacional de Empleo Urbano, which follows the surveyed households for one year, {{we were able to}} construct transition matrices for two specific periods, 1994 - 1995 and 1996 - 1997, the crisis and the recovery periods, respectively. The occupation states we analysed were out of the labour force, unemployment, formal salary workers, informal salary workers, employers, single selfemployed workers, owners of small household businesses and <b>unpaid</b> <b>family</b> <b>workers.</b> We also estimated a multinomial logit model explaining these transitions with individual and household characteristics. The main result is that during the crisis many households started a family business as their best survival strategy. Most people starting a family business in 1995 had been out of the labour force or were salary workers in 1994. During this period there was also an important increase of <b>unpaid</b> <b>family</b> <b>workers,</b> who were mainly out of the labour force a year before. Thus the crisis made many people change their occupational state, but these changes sometimes changed as well the household’s dynamics. The size of the household {{played a crucial role in}} explaining the transitions into family businesses. The larger the household, the greater the chances of making a transition into a <b>family</b> business (with <b>unpaid</b> <b>family</b> <b>workers).</b> The opposite result holds for making a transition into and from single self-employed workers.

40|$|I. Specific {{objectives}} This paper {{attempts to}} measure the gender wage gap in Taiwan, {{in order to examine}} whether the change in sector of employment can help explain the stable female-male earning ratio and wage discrimination against woman in Taiwan from 1979 to 1995. The Hypothesis in this paper is that the change in structures of employment between employer, self-employed, government worker, private worker and <b>unpaid</b> <b>family</b> <b>worker</b> declines the male-female wage gap. II. Background and significance: 1. Background: In the past thirty years, Taiwan has experienced one of the highest economic growth rate periods in the world, and became the world’s 14 th largest trading area. On average, real GDP grew {{at an annual rate of}} over 6 % in dollar term. The rate is higher than that in Singapore and Hong Kong during the same period. With the economic development, the female employee's sector has been changing as well. During the period between 1978 and 1995, the percentage of female in agriculture declined from 26 % to 12 %, but the ones in industry and service increased, respectively, from 39 % to 43 % and 35 % to 46 %. * Moreover, women labor force participation has been on the rise. From 1975 to 1996, female labor force participation in Taiwan increased from 38 % to 45 %, while the 2 rate of men declined from 78 % to 71 % a. During the same period, the percentage of working-aged women with vocational or university-level training jumped from 16 % to 37 %, but the number for men only increased from 25 % to 44 %. Furthermore, in recent years, the numbers of female who enroll in universities are almost same as that of male. From the above surveys, all these shifts seem to be favorable for the women. It is understandable that more and more of Taiwan’s economy were built with labor of women, and women should be in a better situation today than before. However, the fact is that the ratio of earning between female and male in Taiwan has been relatively constant, and, even now, the earning of female is only two of thirds of that of male, which is of great interests and significance and has been studied extensively by many researchers...|$|E
