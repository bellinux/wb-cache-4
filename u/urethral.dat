5|$|Branches also {{innervate}} {{muscles of}} the perineum and the pelvic floor; namely, the bulbospongiosus and the ischiocavernosus muscles respectively, the levator ani muscle (including the Iliococcygeus, pubococcygeus, puborectalis and either pubovaginalis in females or puboprostaticus in males) the external anal sphincter (via the inferior anal branch), and male or female external <b>urethral</b> sphincter.|$|E
5|$|According to the Kennel Club Purebred Dog Health Survey {{conducted}} in 2004, the two breeds had similar average lifespans: {{the median age}} at death was 12 years 3 months for Pembrokes, and 12 years 2 months for Cardigans. The {{main causes of death}} were similar in both breeds: the primary causes were canine cancer and old age. However, the Pembroke breed showed a higher proportion of deaths attributed to either kidney failure or a <b>urethral</b> obstruction.|$|E
5|$|Several {{researchers}} {{also consider the}} connection between the Skene's gland and the G-spot to be weak. The <b>urethral</b> sponge, however, which is also hypothesized as the G-spot, contains sensitive nerve endings and erectile tissue. Sensitivity is not determined by neuron density alone: other factors include the branching patterns of neuron terminals and cross or collateral innervation of neurons. While G-spot opponents argue that because there are very few tactile nerve endings in the vagina and that therefore the G-spot cannot exist, G-spot proponents argue that vaginal orgasms rely on pressure-sensitive nerves.|$|E
5|$|The pudendal nerve is {{the main}} nerve of the perineum. It carries {{sensation}} from the external genitalia of both sexes and the skin around the anus and perineum, as well the motor supply to various pelvic muscles, including the male or female external <b>urethral</b> sphincter and the external anal sphincter. If damaged, most commonly by childbirth, lesions may cause sensory loss or fecal incontinence. The nerve may be temporarily blocked {{as part of an}} anaesthetic procedure.|$|E
5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Sigmodontinae, Oryzomys couesi has a complex penis, with the baculum (penis bone) ending in three cartilaginous digits at its tip. The outer surface of the penis is mostly covered by small spines, {{but there is a}} broad band of nonspinous tissue. The papilla (nipple-like projection) on the dorsal (upper) side of the penis is covered with small spines, a character Oryzomys couesi shares only with Oligoryzomys and the marsh rice rat among oryzomyines examined. On the <b>urethral</b> process, located in the crater {{at the end of the}} penis, a fleshy process (the subapical lobule) is present; it is absent in all other oryzomyines with studied penes except the marsh rice rat and Holochilus brasiliensis.|$|E
5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Sigmodontinae, the marsh rice rat and O.couesi have a complex penis, with the baculum (penis bone) displaying large protuberances at the sides. The outer surface of the penis is mostly covered by small spines, {{but there is a}} broad band of nonspinous tissue. The papilla (nipple-like projection) on the dorsal (upper) side of the penis is covered with small spines, a character these two species share only with Oligoryzomys among oryzomyines examined. On the <b>urethral</b> process, located in the crater {{at the end of the}} penis, a fleshy process (the subapical lobule) is present; it is absent in all other oryzomyines with studied penes except Holochilus brasiliensis. Both traits are recovered as synapomorphies of O.couesi plus the marsh rice rat in Weksler's analysis.|$|E
5|$|However, Ruiz died in Valparaíso, Chile {{soon after}} his arrival in the country. He {{reportedly}} had uremia and a <b>urethral</b> obstruction, both of which deteriorated into Fournier gangrene, which killed him soon after. Later speculation that Ruiz had been poisoned or killed has been countered by three facts: that Ruiz's brother, Mariano Ruiz Quiñones (who was the coordinator of the revolution in Curaçao), died of the same condition soon after (suggesting a genetic predisposition to it), that Betances had used a catheter on Ruiz before he left Saint Thomas to bring him some relief from his condition, and that Betances published a medical article in France twenty years later, in 1887, that discussed the condition, out {{of what he had}} described as many years of second-guessing what could have been done to save Ruiz's life.|$|E
5|$|If {{exposed to}} testosterone, the genital {{tubercle}} elongates {{to form the}} penis. By fusion of the urogenital folds– elongated spindle-shaped structures {{that contribute to the}} formation of the <b>urethral</b> groove on the belly aspect of the genital tubercle– the urogenital sinus closes completely and forms the spongy urethra, and the labioscrotal swellings unite to form the scrotum. In the absence of testosterone, the genital tubercle allows for formation of the clitoris; the initially rapid growth of the phallus gradually slows and the clitoris is formed. The urogenital sinus persists as the vestibule of the vagina, the two urogenital folds form the labia minora, and the labioscrotal swellings enlarge to form the labia majora, completing the female genitalia. A rare condition that can develop from higher than average androgen exposure is clitoromegaly.|$|E
5|$|The Pembroke is {{the more}} popular breed of dog, with the Cardigan Welsh Corgi {{appearing}} on The Kennel Club's list of Vulnerable Native Breeds. There are several physical {{differences between the two}} types according to the breed standards: the Cardigan is larger overall, both in weight and in height. Traditionally, the tails were of different shapes, but docking had previously been used. With regards to their health, according to a 2004 survey, they both had similar lifespans, although kidney or <b>urethral</b> conditions are more likely in the Pembrokes. Furthermore, Pembroke Corgis {{were more likely to have}} eye problems than the Cardigan breed. Welsh Corgis have a strong association with Queen Elizabeth II, who has personally owned more than 30 dogs, either Pembrokes or Corgi/Dachshund crosses.|$|E
25|$|Posterior <b>urethral</b> valves; <b>urethral</b> or meatal stenosis. These causes {{are treated}} surgically when possible.|$|E
25|$|The sex of kittens {{is usually}} easy to {{determine}} at birth. By {{six to eight}} weeks they are harder to sex because of the growth of fur in the genital region. The male's <b>urethral</b> opening is round, whereas the female's <b>urethral</b> opening is a slit. Another marked difference is the distance between anus and <b>urethral</b> opening, which is greater in males than in females.|$|E
25|$|Acute, {{uncomplicated}} <b>urethral</b> and cervical gonorrhea.|$|E
25|$|<b>Urethral</b> plugs in {{cats are}} usually {{composed}} of struvite crystals and organic matter.|$|E
25|$|Neutering {{also has}} been {{associated}} with an increased likelihood of <b>urethral</b> sphincter incontinence in male dogs.|$|E
25|$|Urinary incontinence* is leakage of urine, usually due to {{incompetence}} of the <b>urethral</b> sphincter {{in adult}} dogs and ectopic ureter (a congenital {{condition in which}} the ureter enters the urinary tract posterior to the <b>urethral</b> sphincter) in puppies. In adult dogs it is most commonly seen in large spayed females. The lack of estrogens in spayed dogs {{has been linked to}} development of incontinence. Replacement of estrogens, phenylpropanolamine, and surgery have all been used for treatment.|$|E
25|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis for LUTS is broad and includes various medical conditions, neurologic disorders, {{and other diseases}} of the bladder, urethra, and prostate such as bladder cancer, urinary tract infection, <b>urethral</b> stricture, <b>urethral</b> calculi (stones), chronic prostatitis, and prostate cancer. Neurogenic bladder can cause urinary retention and cause symptoms {{similar to those of}} BPH. This may occur as a result of uncoordinated contraction of the bladder muscle or impairment in the timing of bladder muscle contraction and <b>urethral</b> sphincter relaxation. Notable causes of neurogenic bladder include disorders of the central nervous system such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injuries as well as disorders of the peripheral nervous system such as diabetes mellitus, vitamin B12 deficiency, and alcohol-induced nerve damage. Individuals affected by heart failure often experience nighttime awakenings to urinate due to redistribution of fluid accumulated in swollen legs.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone {{will cause}} an {{enlargement}} of the clitoris and possibly has important effects on the growth and maturation of the vestibular bulbs, corpus cavernosum of the clitoris and <b>urethral</b> sponge.|$|E
25|$|Smooth muscle bundles pass {{on either}} side of the urethra, and these fibers are {{sometimes}} called the internal <b>urethral</b> sphincter, although they do not encircle the urethra. Further along the urethra is a sphincter of skeletal muscle, the sphincter of the membranous urethra (external <b>urethral</b> sphincter). The bladder's epithelium is termed transitional epithelium which contains a superficial layer of dome-like cells and multiple layers of stratified cuboidal cells underneath when evacuated. When the bladder is fully distended the superficial cells become squamous (flat) and the stratification of the cuboidal cells is reduced in order to provide lateral stretching.|$|E
25|$|On December 11, 2009, the Nevada State Board of Health {{unanimously}} {{agreed to}} add <b>urethral</b> examinations to the guidelines, thus allowing male sex workers {{to be tested}} for sexually transmitted diseases.|$|E
25|$|Posterior <b>urethral</b> valve (PUV) {{disorder}} is an obstructive developmental anomaly in the urethra and genitourinary system of male newborns. A posterior <b>urethral</b> valve is an obstructing membrane in the posterior male urethra {{as a result}} of abnormal in utero development. It is {{the most common cause of}} bladder outlet obstruction in male newborns. The disorder varies in degree, with mild cases followed conservatively. More severe cases can have renal and respiratory failure from lung underdevelopment as result of low amniotic fluid volumes, requiring intensive care and close monitoring. It occurs in about one in 8000 babies.|$|E
25|$|As {{compared}} to intact males, castrated cats {{are at an}} increased risk for certain problems associated with feline lower urinary tract disease, including the presence of stones or a plug in the urethra and <b>urethral</b> blockage.|$|E
25|$|Nucleic acid {{amplification}} {{tests are}} the recommended {{method of diagnosis}} for gonorrhea and chlamydia. This can be done on either urine in both men and women, vaginal or cervical swabs in women, or <b>urethral</b> swabs in men.|$|E
25|$|The neck of {{the bladder}} is the area {{at the base of}} the trigone that {{surrounds}} the internal <b>urethral</b> orifice that leads to the urethra. In males the {{neck of the}} urinary bladder is adjacent to the prostate gland.|$|E
25|$|The vagina {{has been}} studied in humans more {{than it has been}} in other animals. Its {{location}} and structure varies among species, and may vary in size within the same species. Female mammals usually have the opening of the urethra of the urinary system separate to the vaginal opening of the genital tract. This is different to male mammals, who usually have a single opening, the external <b>urethral</b> opening for both urination and reproduction. The vaginal opening is much larger than the nearby <b>urethral</b> opening, and both are protected by the labia in humans. In amphibians, birds, reptiles and monotremes, the cloaca is the single external opening for the gastrointestinal tract and the urinary and reproductive tracts.|$|E
25|$|Grade 5, {{the form}} of PAIS with the {{greatest}} degree of androgen insensitivity, presents with a mostly female phenotype, including separate <b>urethral</b> and vaginal orifices, but also shows signs of slight masculinization including mild clitoromegaly and / or partial labial fusion.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears that}} paruresis {{involves}} a tightening of the sphincter and/or bladder neck {{due to a}} sympathetic nervous system response. The adrenaline rush that produces the involuntary nervous system response probably has peripheral and central nervous system involvement. The internal <b>urethral</b> sphincter (smooth muscle tissue) or the external <b>urethral</b> sphincter (striated muscle), levator ani (especially the pubococcygeus) muscle area, {{or some combination of}} the above, may be involved. It is possible that there is an inhibition of the detrusor command through a reflex pathway as well. The pontine micturition center (Barrington's nucleus) also may be involved, as its inhibition results in relaxation of the detrusor and prevents the relaxation of the internal sphincter.|$|E
25|$|In healthy individuals, {{the lower}} urinary tract has two {{discrete}} phases of activity: the storage (or guarding) phase, when urine {{is stored in}} the bladder; and the voiding phase, when urine is released through the urethra. The state of the reflex system is dependent on both a conscious signal from the brain and the firing rate of sensory fibers from the bladder and urethra. At low bladder volumes, afferent firing is low, resulting in excitation of the outlet (the sphincter and urethra), and relaxation of the bladder. At high bladder volumes, afferent firing increases, causing a conscious sensation of urinary urge. When the individual is ready to urinate, he or she consciously initiates voiding, causing the bladder to contract and the outlet to relax. Voiding continues until the bladder empties completely, {{at which point the}} bladder relaxes and the outlet contracts to re-initiate storage. The muscles controlling micturition are controlled by the autonomic and somatic nervous systems. During the storage phase the internal <b>urethral</b> sphincter remains tense and the detrusor muscle relaxed by sympathetic stimulation. During micturition, parasympathetic stimulation causes the detrusor muscle to contract and the internal <b>urethral</b> sphincter to relax. The external <b>urethral</b> sphincter (sphincter urethrae) is under somatic control and is consciously relaxed during micturition.|$|E
25|$|In men, the {{prostate}} gland lies outside the opening for the urethra. The middle lobe of {{the prostate}} causes an elevation in the mucous membrane behind the internal <b>urethral</b> orifice called the uvula of urinary bladder. The uvula can enlarge when the prostate becomes enlarged.|$|E
25|$|During sexual {{differentiation}} of females, without testosterone, the urogenital sinus persists as the vestibule of the vagina. The two urogenital folds (elongated spindle-shaped structures {{that contribute to}} the formation of the <b>urethral</b> groove on the belly aspect of the genital tubercle) form the labia minora, and the labioscrotal swellings enlarge to form the labia majora.|$|E
25|$|During this phase, {{the male}} <b>urethral</b> {{sphincter}} contracts (so as to prevent urine from mixing with semen, and {{to guard against}} retrograde ejaculation) and muscles {{at the base of}} the penis begin a steady rhythmic contraction. Males may start to secrete seminal fluid or pre-ejaculatory fluid and the testicles rise closer to the body.|$|E
25|$|The {{prostate}} gland originates with tissues in the <b>urethral</b> wall. This means the urethra, a compressible tube used for urination, {{runs through the}} middle of the prostate. This leads to an evolutionary design fault for some mammals, including human males. The prostate is prone to infection and enlargement later in life, constricting the urethra so urinating becomes slow and painful.|$|E
25|$|Treatments {{range from}} behavioral-based options such as {{bedwetting}} alarms, to medication such as hormone replacement, and even surgery such as <b>urethral</b> enlargement. Since most bedwetting {{is simply a}} developmental delay, most treatment plans aim to protect or improve self-esteem. Treatment guidelines recommend that the physician counsel the parents, warning about psychological damage caused by pressure, shaming, or punishment for a condition children cannot control.|$|E
25|$|In some animals, in {{addition}} to expelling waste material, urination can mark territory or express submissiveness. Physiologically, urination involves coordination between the central, autonomic, and somatic nervous systems. Brain centers that regulate urination include the pontine micturition center, periaqueductal gray, and the cerebral cortex. In placental mammals, urine is drained through the urinary meatus, a <b>urethral</b> opening in the male penis or female vulval vestibule.|$|E
25|$|Glass dildos {{have similar}} {{features}} to steel ones. In {{most of the}} cases, glass toys are solid, and made of Pyrex or other types borosilicate glass (Schott-Duranglas and Simax), although this may vary, depending on the manufacturer. Like steel, glass toys {{may be used to}} apply firmer pressure than silicone can to a female's G-spot (<b>urethral</b> sponge) or male's prostate gland. Unlike other types of toys, glass sex toys can also be personalized with inscriptions.|$|E
25|$|In women, PSA {{is found}} in female {{ejaculate}} at concentrations roughly equal to that found in male semen. Other than semen and female ejaculate, the greatest concentrations of PSA in biological fluids are detected in breast milk and amniotic fluid. Low concentrations of PSA {{have been identified in}} the <b>urethral</b> glands, endometrium, normal breast tissue and salivary gland tissue. PSA also {{is found in}} the serum of women with breast, lung, or uterine cancer and in some patients with renal cancer.|$|E
25|$|Stage 5 denotes {{complete}} male virilization, with a normally formed penis {{with the}} <b>urethral</b> opening {{at or near}} the tip. The scrotum is normally formed but empty. The internal pelvic organs include normal ovaries and uterus, and the vagina connects internally with the urethra as in Stage 4. These infants are not visibly ambiguous, and are usually assumed to be ordinary boys with undescended testes. In most cases, the diagnosis of CAH is not suspected until signs of salt-wasting develop a week later.|$|E
