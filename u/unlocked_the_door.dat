5|$|The {{uprising}} {{was launched}} {{on the hot}} summer day of 2 August 1943 (Monday, a regular day of rest from gassing), {{when a group of}} Germans and 40 Ukrainians drove off to the River Bug to swim. The conspirators silently <b>unlocked</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to the arsenal near the train tracks, with a key that had been duplicated earlier. They had stolen 20–25 rifles, 20 hand grenades, and several pistols, and delivered them in a cart to the gravel work detail. At 3:45p.m., 700 Jews launched an insurgency that lasted for 30 minutes. They set buildings ablaze, exploded a tank of petrol, and set fire to the surrounding structures. A group of armed Jews attacked the main gate, and others attempted to climb the fence. Machine-gun fire from about 25 Germans and 60 Ukrainian Trawnikis resulted in near-total slaughter. Lajcher was killed along with most of the insurgents. About 200 Jews escaped from the camp. Half of them were killed after a chase in cars and on horses. The Jews did not cut the phone wires, and Stangl called in hundreds of German reinforcements, who arrived from four different towns and set up roadblocks along the way. Partisans of the Armia Krajowa (Polish: Home Army) transported some of the surviving escapees across the river and others like Sperling ran 30 kilometres (19 miles) and were then helped and fed by Polish villagers. Of those who broke through, around 70 are known to have survived {{until the end of the}} war, including the future authors of published Treblinka memoirs: Richard Glazar, Chil Rajchman, Jankiel Wiernik, and Samuel Willenberg.|$|E

2500|$|In Pasteur's day, and {{for many}} years after his death, the word [...] "virus" [...] was used to {{describe}} any cause of infectious disease. Many bacteriologists soon discovered the cause of numerous infections. However, some infections remained, many of them horrendous, for which no bacterial cause could be found. These agents were invisible and could only be grown in living animals. The discovery of viruses was the key that <b>unlocked</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> that withheld {{the secrets of the}} cause of these mysterious infections. And, although Koch's postulates could not be fulfilled for many of these infections, this did not stop the pioneer virologists from looking for viruses in infections for which no other cause could be found.|$|E

'It does arise {{directly}} from the consideration of the struggle {{to get away from}} speaking Cornish dialect and to speak correct English, a struggle which I began thus early and pursued constantly with no regret, for was it not the key which <b>unlocked</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to all that lay beyond—Oxford, the world of letters, the community of all who speak the King’s English, from which I should otherwise have been infallibly barred? But the struggle made me very sensitive about language; I hated to be corrected; nothing is more humiliating: and it left me with a complex about Cornish dialect. The inhibition which I had imposed on myself left me, by the time I got to Oxford, incapable of speaking it; and for years, with the censor operating subconsciously...' ...|$|E

50|$|Widely used in automobiles, an RKS {{performs}} {{the functions of}} a standard car key without physical contact. When within a few yards of the car, pressing {{a button on the}} remote can lock or <b>unlock</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> and may perform other functions. A remote keyless system can include both a remote keyless entry system (RKE), which <b>unlocks</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> and a remote keyless ignition system (RKI), which starts the engine.|$|R
50|$|Often, shops {{will make}} an exit {{emergency}} use only to deter shoplifting. Usually, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is locked with an Emergency exit button next to it.

This deters shoplifting because a person who <b>unlocks</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{in order to take}} an item out of the building when it is not an emergency may be reported to the Police, with CCTV footage if available.|$|R
