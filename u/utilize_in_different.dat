40|$|M. A. Children are {{so often}} seen as unproductive, dependents that are {{vulnerable}} and not {{responsible for their own}} actions. Children are in fact individuals in the process of development that can learn to act in a responsible way and to manage their lives. Because children {{are in the process of}} development and change, it is a challenge for the therapist to meet the unique needs of the child. This study was developed as a response to a need under social workers for structure in the handling of children with adaptation problems. Social workers need more than just techniques that can be utilized with children in therapy. They also need guidelines on the best techniques to <b>utilize</b> <b>in</b> <b>different</b> phases of the process. This programme aimed at developing an integrated model for child therapy that can be utilized for children who have experienced trauma, who have difficulties adapting to new circumstances, who have behavioural problems or who are in need of personal skills. The Intervention Design and Development Model of Rothman and Thomas (1994) was utilized in the development of the new technological item. The different phases used in the development of the model for child therapy were the following: The problem analysis and planning phase, which included the planning of the study and the setting of goals for the study. The information gathering and synthesis phase, which included an investigation into the available sources for the development of new technology for child therapy. The first focus of the actions in this phase was to identify applicable sources that could be utilized to formulate a theoretical basis for the new technology. The theoretical basis served as a frame of reference to identify the most important aspects of a child that a therapy model should take into account. The next focus was to select existing interventions and technologies that could be used to formulate a practice model that would address the needed aspects of a child. The design phase, consisted of setting a preliminary product. The evaluation phase, which included the implementation of the pilot test and both the process and outcome evaluation. The aim of this phase was to test the programme and to see what can be done to improve on the results and to refine the final product. The implementation and dissemination phase which concluded the study by setting the final product ready for distribution. This product, a model for Functional child therapy, does not provide a recipe for child therapy, nor does it only help children to work through present traumas. The main focus of the model is to help children to become unique individuals within a world that is dominated and structured by adults. Children learn with this model not just to react on adult behaviour, but to become active, responsible role players in their own world...|$|E
