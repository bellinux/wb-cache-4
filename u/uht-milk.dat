For instance, fresh honey contains less than 15 mg/kg—depending on pH-value and temperature and age, and the [...] codex alimentarius standard requires that honey have less than 40 mg/kg HMf to guarantee that the honey has not undergone heating during processing, except for tropical honeys which must be below 80 mg/kg.|$|E

For realizing this aim {{it is necessary to}} develop suitable short-time process conditions for thermal stabilization of this product group without a considerable loss of quality (e. g. by microwave application). In this context it is important to elaborate optimized heat transfer conditions and to study the influences of medium properties upon thermal inactivation of microorganisms.

40|$|Milk is {{well known}} to be rich in some {{nutrients}} such as protein, calcium, phosphorus, and vitamins. In particular, absorption and bioavailability of calcium receive lots of attention because calcium is very little absorbed until it is changed to the ion-ized form in the intestine. In this study, concentration of the soluble calcium was determined in the commercial bovine milk products, which were processed by different heat-treatment methods for pasteurization. As for general constituents, lactose, fat, protein, and mineral were almost same in the liquid milk products by different processors. Ultrafiltration of the skimmed milk caused little change in the permeate as for lactose content but both fat and protein decreased. pH values ranges from 6. 57 - 6. 62 at room temperature and slightly increase after centrifugation, 10, 000 g, 10 min. Rennet-coagulation activity was {{the lowest in the}} ultra high temperature (UHT-) milk compared to the low temperature long time (LTLT-) and high tempera-ture short time (HTST-) milk products. Each bovine milk products contains 1056. 5 - 1111. 3 mg/kg of Ca. The content of sulf-hydryl group was the lowest in raw milk compared to the commercial products tested. For the skimmed milks after ultrafil-tration with a membrane (Mw cut-off, 3 Kd), soluble Ca in the raw milk was highest at 450. 2 mg/kg, followed by LTLT-milk 336. 4 - 345. 1 mg/kg, HTST-milk 305. 5 - 313. 3 mg/kg, <b>UHT-milk</b> 370. 3 - 380. 2 mg/kg in the decreasing order.

40|$|In {{case of a}} {{deliberate}} contamination {{of the food chain}} with brucellae {{it is important to know}} the survival of the bacteria in relevant food matrices. Therefore, the survival of Brucella abortus 1119 - 3 was investigated in raw milk as well as in commercially available foods like <b>UHT-milk,</b> certified raw milk, yogurt and still mineral water at general storage conditions. B. abortus 1119 - 3 and B. melitensis 16 M survived longest in <b>UHT-milk</b> in which the total cell count multiplied to more than 10 ^ 8 cfu/ml at the end of the product’s shelf life after 88 days. In still mineral water viable cells of B. abortus 1119 - 3 could be detected for 60 days in culture. Until this day the total cell count declined continuously. In raw milk and certified raw milk this strain survived until the end of the product’s shelf life (four days, respectively). In yogurt viable cells could be detected for two days (1. 5 % fat), four days (3. 5 % fat) or one day (10. 0 % fat), most probably due to the low pH of 4. 2. In case of {{a deliberate}} contamination brucellae would survive at a high concentration for two weeks (still mineral water) or for months (<b>UHT-milk)</b> so that ingestion of the food would most probably lead to brucellosis. Suitable methods for the fast detection and typing of brucellae should be available in case of deliberate contamination of foods. Therefore, six different methods used in combination with PCR were examined regarding their efficiency to extract and detect Brucella-DNA from relevant food matrices. For extraction from still mineral water and physiological saline, the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) revealed the best detection limit of 5 x 10 ^ 1 cfu/ml. For raw milk both the kit and the phenol chloroform extraction were best suited of which the latter was more reliable at a detection limit of 5 x 10 ^ 1 cfu/ml. The detection limit for brucellae in yogurt (10 % fat) was better with phenol chloroform extraction (1 x 10 ^ 2 cfu/ml) than with QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (1 x 10 ^ 4 cfu/ml). By means of phenol chloroform extraction which is most suitable for milk products, the detection limit for Brucella DNA in camembert and goat cheese corresponded with 5 x 10 ^ 2 cfu/g. The extraction of DNA from soft cheese requires a homogenisation after dilution in a fluid which diminishes sensitivity. In contrast to cultivation of brucellae on nutrient agar for several days under biosafety level 3 conditions, the detection by using DNA extraction followed by real-time PCR can be achieved within half a working day (QIAamp DNA Mini Kit) or alternatively within one day (phenol chloroform extraction) under biosafety level 2 conditions. However, the limit for detection of Brucella DNA could not be improved by use of real-time PCR compared to the classical PCR. In order to optimize the detection limits for Brucella DNA especially in milk products, the immunomagnetic separation (IMS) was tested as a pre-enrichment and purification procedure. For this purpose, tosyl activated immunomagnetic particles coated with brucellosis serum or with a monoclonal anti-Brucella antibody were used. Despite the optimization of IMS considering different parameters such as sample volume, incubation time and temperature, the limit for the detection of Brucella DNA was 5 x 10 ^ 3 cfu/g for goat cheese, 1 x 10 ^ 3 cfu/ml for raw milk and still mineral water, 8 x 10 ^ 4 cfu/ml for yogurt and 5 x 10 ^ 4 cfu/g for camembert and was thus less sensitive than DNA extraction methods mentioned above...|$|E
40|$|Bacillus sporothermodurans is an industrially {{important}} micro-organism {{because of}} its ability to produce endospores which resist ultra high temperature (UHT) and industrial sterilization processes. It was described by Pettersson et al. (1996) based on seven genetically homogeneous isolates all from <b>UHT-milk.</b> Bacillus oleronius, the closest phylogenetic neighbor of B. sporothermodurans, was described by Kuhnigk et al. (1995), based on a single strain, isolated from the hindgut of the termite Reticulitermes santonensis. A polyphasic study of a heterogeneous collection of B. sporothermodurans and B. oleronius strains isolated from various sources and geographic origins led to an emended description of both species. Additional data presented are the results of fatty acids, quinones and/or cell wall analysis (polar lipids). DNA-DNA hybridizations confirmed 3 subgroups of strains obtained after SDS-PAGE analysis of cellular proteins as B. sporothermodurans. One named B. sporothermodurans strain (R- 7489) was reclassified as a Bacillus fordii strain. The phenotypic profiles of both species were rather heterogeneous, sometimes different from the original descriptions and did not differ in a large number of characters, although B. oleronius generally gave stronger reactions in its positive tests than did B. sporothermodurans; the variable and weak reactions for both organisms with some substrates blurred the distinction between both. However, differences in polar lipid, SDS-PAGE and menaquinone profiles clearly allow distinction between the two species...|$|E
40|$|Endospore-forming {{bacteria}} {{were recovered}} from individual packages from different processing lines in a dairy plant during a tenacious periodical contamination of their <b>UHT-milk</b> production. Two colony types were seen, {{one of which}} was identified as Bacillus sporothermodurans. Analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene of the second colony type placed these isolates within the genus Paenibacillus, with Paenibacillus lautus as the closest known relative. Moreover, over 99 % similarity was observed to the 16 S rDNA sequence of MB 2035, a strain isolated previously from raw milk during a survey at dairy farms for very heat-resistant spore-forming bacteria. Nine other potentially closely related strains among the dairy farm isolates were found using rep-PCR typing. The taxonomic positions of these 19 isolates were further investigated using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and DNA-DNA hybridizations of representative strains. All 19 isolates shared a high degree of phenotypic similarity and were easily distinguished from closely related members of the genus. Anteiso-C- 15 : 0, C- 16 : 0 and iSO-C- 15 : 0 were among the major fatty acids and the genomic DNA G + C content was 51. 6 - 51. 7 mol%. Therefore, based on their phenotypic, phylogenetic and genomic distinctiveness, these 19 strains, isolated from both raw and heat-treated milk, are placed in the genus Paenibacillus as Paenibacillus lactis sp. nov. The type strain is MB 1871 (T) (= LMG 21940 (T) = DSM 15596 (T)) ...|$|E
40|$|Carbohydrate reduced lactose {{hydrolysed}} milks (CRHM) {{tasting the}} same as normal milk have become very popular in several countries. Hitherto their quality during manufacturing and storage has not been studied very closely and compared {{to the quality of}} traditional lactose hydrolysed milk (HM) or unhydrolysed milk (UM). The changes caused by the Maillard reactions and proteolysis were followed in different types of lactose hydrolysed skim milks. Lactose hydrolysed milk is highly vulnerable to Maillard reactions and therefore its nutritional quality is often impaired due to the reactions between free amino groups of lysine and reducing sugars. The molar quantity of reducing sugars in HM is almost twofold that in UM. The early stages of Maillard reactions were followed by measuring furosine, which can be released from the Amadori products of lysine and reducing sugars. The blockage of lysine was estimated on the basis of furosine. Pasteurization of lactose hydrolysed skim milk caused only a small increase in furosine compared to UM. In more intensive heat treatments, ESL- and UHT-treatment, furosine formation was more intensive and was found to be closely related to the level of reducing sugars in lactose hydrolysed milk. The hydrolysis products of lactose, i. e. glucose and galactose, were more reactive than lactose in the Maillard reactions occurring during UHT-treatment. As their taste is also sweeter than that of lactose, reduction of the content of monosaccharides in milk improves the nutritional quality of proteins {{and at the same time}} preserves the original taste of milk. The almost total removal of lactose with a chromatographic process reduced the blockage of lysine to a negligible level and improved the nutritional value of protein in carbohydrate free milk (CFM) during storage compared to HMs. Proteolysis in lactose hydrolysed UHT-milks is a common problem caused by the indigenous plasmin enzyme system in milk, proteases of contaminating microbes or side activities of the lactase enzyme preparation used. The proteolytic changes and Maillard reactions occurring in lactose hydrolysed milk were largely avoided by separating lactose from milk proteins in a chromatographic process and at the same time subjecting the protein fraction to a heat treatment largely inactivating the proteolytic enzymes. <b>UHT-milk</b> made from fractionated milk protein (CFM) had a longer shelf life than traditionally manufactured HM...|$|E
40|$|Milk {{is a very}} nutritious {{and widely}} {{consumed}} food, {{as well as a}} versatile raw material for the food industry. Processing involves converting raw milk into a wide range of dairy-based food products. Advanced processing technologies such as ultra-high temperatures (UHT) result in production and transportation efficiencies, extended shelf-life and wider distribution. The objectives of this study were to (i) identify the raw material quality of UHT-treated milk by monitoring protease activity, (ii) develop shelf-stable formulations of dairy beverages enriched with protein and dietary fibre, and iii) utilise protein enrichment to provide highly nutritious dairy-based desserts thus meeting consumer nutritional expectations. Protease activity in UHT-treated milk was determined in relation to age-gelation during room temperature storage. Proteases, from psychrotrophic Pseudomonas spp., which are strongly associated with age-gelation in UHT milks, were extracted and added to raw skim milk at 0 to 0. 005 % (v/v). Protease activity before and after UHT treatment (135 oC/ 2 s) was estimated using the FITC-casein assay. During storage, the microbial count and pH of the samples remained the same to that recorded immediately after UHT treatment. The association between peptide generation and added enzyme extract in <b>UHT-milk</b> can also be related to their shelf-life. When gelation was identifiable visually, the viscosity produced by the free amino groups in samples with added crude protease was similar, irrespective of the enzyme concentration added. The relationship between threshold enzymatic activity and storage of the UHT-treated milk was estimated from an empirically derived equation (R 2 of 0. 9943) : y (shelf-life in weeks) = 9. 6301 x- 2. 12; where x is the enzyme activity in terms of FITC isomer 1 (× 10 - 4 nM). Increasing consumer interest in a healthy diet in terms of protein, dietary fibre and energy intake opens opportunities for the development of novel dairy-based products. Reverse formulation engineering of selected commercial dairy beverages was performed by investigating their nutritional composition and steady-shear flow behaviour leading to the development of formulations enriched with protein and dietary fibre. Characterisation of physicochemical properties (and colour) of novel formulations containing 6. 1 % (w/w) protein and 2 % (w/w) dietary fibre and the commercial product indicated that both systems are similar; an outcome which was further confirmed by consumers acceptance of the novel dairy beverage during sensory evaluation. Similar to earlier work, reverse formulation engineering of commercial dairy desserts was carried out by establishing a database of steady-shear flow and textural profile that had to be imitated in novel formulations. Whey protein and/or casein were incorporated to achieve high levels of protein (11. 5 % w/w) and leucine (1. 2 % w/w). The physicochemical properties (steady shear viscosity, small deformation dynamic oscillatory in shear and texture profile) of the protein-enriched dairy desserts were examined. The textural characteristics of the enriched and commercial products were similar, even though the latter had 50 % less protein than the novel formulations. Rheology results and microscopy images of both the commercial product and the protein-enriched dairy desserts indicate similar structural features. Moreover, results from sensory evaluation revealed that the nutritious dairy desserts were liked by consumers...|$|E
40|$|The study {{describes}} two trials on {{artificial insemination}} in Romney ewes. Trial 1 {{was conducted to}} examine the anatomical site in the reproductive tract of the inseminating needle after transcervical insemination, and to evaluate {{the effect of the}} needle in causing cervical tissue damage based on the microscopic assessment of cervical slides. Trial 2 was undertaken to compare the effect of intrauterine, cervical or transcervical methods of insemination with fresh semen on fertility. Two hundred and five mixed-aged ewes (3 - 8 years old) were hormonally treated with CIDR-G for 12 days and these were removed after this period. Forty-eight hours later, to monitor the onset of oestrus, they were joined with 10 harnessed vasectomised rams. Oestrous detection was undertaken twice daily, at 1. 00 am and 1. 00 pm. Most ewes were synchronised in oestrus over 2 days after CIDR withdrawal but there was an extended period of 'second' oestrus when the inseminations were conducted. In Trial 1, transcervical insemination with Indian ink was performed in 29 ewes at the second oestrus, and then they were euthanased with Sodium Pentobarbitone. Position of the inseminating needle in situ was determined at dissection. The genital tract was removed and the uterus opened to determine whether Indian ink had penetrated. The cervix was then split into three similar sized portions, fixed in Bouins solution, and sections histologically processed and stained for slides. The slides were microscopically examined by two evaluators to determine damage scores. In trial 2, semen samples (concentration at least 3 x 109 spermatozoa ml- 1, motility minimal 4) were collected per artificial vagina from 5 Romney rams, pooled and freshly diluted with <b>UHT-milk</b> to 8 x 108 spermatozoa ml- 1. One hundred and seventy-five cyclic ewes were randomly assigned to either of three AI techniques (intrauterine, cervical and transcervical), and were inseminated with freshly diluted semen at a mean interval of 6. 1 0. 26 h after second oestrus was detected. In slaughtered ewes, penetration of the modified needle through the lumen of the cervix and even into the uterus occurred more that with the unmodified needle (90 % vs 68 %; 0. 05 <P< 0. 1). Both types of needle used caused damage in the genital tract, and even caused rupture through the wall of the cervix. This was less frequent with the modified needle and therefore it was used for transcervical insemination in Trial 2. The predicted location of the needle in the tract and its actual location were highly correlated. In Trial 2, the overall mean for the conception rate to AI was 82 %, but no differences were noted between methods of inseminations. With lambing rate, transcervical inseminations gave the best results, but there were no differences in the litter size between methods. For transcervical insemination depth of penetration of the needle had an effect on conception rate and lambing rate (P< 0. 05) and thus the method should aim to place the semen well into and even through the cervix. The results for transcervical insemination were not affected by the interval from oestrous detection to insemination, or the age of the ewes or whether the inseminations were conducted in the morning or afternoon. The technique was more difficult to accomplish in maiden than older ewes. It was concluded that while transcervical insemination with freshly diluted semen gave a satisfactory result, it is not always suitable for maiden ewes and others, where difficulty is encountered in penetrating through the cervix. Further work to evaluate the technique with larger numbers of ewes is required...|$|E
