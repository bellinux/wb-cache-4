5|$|The arch {{is named}} after Biblical scholar Edward Robinson who {{identified}} its remnants in 1838. Excavations {{during the second half}} of the 20th century revealed both its purpose and the extent of its associated structures. Today the considerable surviving portions of the ancient overpass complex may be viewed by the public within the Jerusalem Archaeological Park.

Galatasaray fans used similar chants before their UEFA Champions League match in 2012 against Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|While the Tiberian, Babylonian, and Palestinian reading {{traditions are}} extinct, various other systems of {{pronunciation}} have evolved over time, notably the Yemenite, Sephardi, Ashkenazi, and Samaritan traditions. Modern Hebrew pronunciation is also <b>used</b> <b>by</b> <b>some</b> to read biblical texts. The modern reading traditions do not stem solely from the Tiberian system; for instance, the Sephardic tradition's distinction between qamatz gadol and qatan is pre-Tiberian. However, the only orthographic system used to mark vowels is the Tiberian vocalization.|$|E

5|$|Bivalve {{molluscs}} {{are used}} as bioindicators to monitor the health of aquatic environments in both fresh water and the marine environments. Their population status or structure, physiology, behaviour or the level of contamination with elements or compounds can indicate the state of contamination status of the ecosystem. They are particularly useful since they are sessile {{so that they are}} representative of the environment where they are sampled or placed. Potamopyrgus antipodarum is <b>used</b> <b>by</b> <b>some</b> water treatment plants to test for estrogen-mimicking pollutants from industrial agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Commercially {{prepared}} old-fashioned doughnut batter mixes are mass-produced in the United States, {{which may}} be prepared by simply adding cold water to the mix. Prepared mixes are <b>used</b> <b>by</b> <b>some</b> doughnut shops. Doughnut shops may prepare old-fashioned doughnuts by loading the batter into the hopper of a doughnut maker, which upon turning a hand crank, drops a formed doughnut into a deep fryer. Doughnut makers are also used for other doughnut varieties, such as cake doughnuts, yeast doughnuts, cream filled, and jelly filled doughnuts.|$|E
5|$|Counter-illumination means {{producing}} {{light to}} match a background that is brighter than an animal's body or military vehicle; it {{is a form}} of active camouflage. It is notably <b>used</b> <b>by</b> <b>some</b> species of squid, such as the firefly squid and the midwater squid. The latter has light-producing organs (photophores) scattered all over its underside; these create a sparkling glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below. Counterillumination camouflage is the likely function of the bioluminescence of many marine organisms, though light is also produced to attract or to detect prey and for signalling.|$|E
5000|$|In some languages, for example, German, the Latin [...] "catholica" [...] was {{substituted}} by [...] "Christian" [...] {{before the}} Reformation, {{though this was}} an anomaly and continues in <b>use</b> <b>by</b> <b>some</b> Protestant churches today.

5|$|Counter-illumination through {{bioluminescence}} on {{the underside}} (ventral region) {{of the body is}} found in many species that live in the open ocean down to about 1000 metres. The generated light increases an animal's brightness when seen from below to match the brightness of the ocean surface; it is an effective form of active camouflage. It is notably <b>used</b> <b>by</b> <b>some</b> species of squid, such as the midwater squid, Abralia veranyi. These have light-producing organs (photophores) scattered all over their undersides, creating a sparkling glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below. Counter-illumination camouflage is the likely function of the bioluminescence of many marine organisms, though light is also produced to attract or to detect prey and for signalling.|$|E
5|$|Eyespots are {{a type of}} automimicry <b>used</b> <b>by</b> <b>some</b> lepidopterans. In butterflies, {{the spots}} are {{composed}} of concentric rings of scales of different colours. The proposed role of the eyespots is to deflect predators' attention. Their resemblance to eyes provokes the predator's instinct to attack these wing patterns. The role of filamentous tails in Lycaenidae has been suggested as confusing predators as to the real location of the head, giving them {{a better chance of}} escaping alive and relatively unscathed.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, American {{botanist}} Paul C. Standley described {{three new}} species based on collections from Panama and Costa Rica—Ficus tuerckheimii, F. isophlebia and F. jimenezii. DeWolf {{concluded that they}} were all the same species, and Berg synonymised them with F. aurea. These names have been used widely for Mexican and Central American populations, and continue to be <b>used</b> <b>by</b> <b>some</b> authors. Berg suspected that Ficus rzedowskiana Carvajal and Cuevas-Figueroa may also belong to this species, but he had not examined the original material upon which this species was based.|$|E
