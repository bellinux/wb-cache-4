25|$|Bond {{returned}} in 1983 {{for a fourth}} challenge, complete with a symbolic golden wrench which he claimed {{would be used to}} <b>unbolt</b> the cup from its plinth, so that he could take it back to Australia. In 1983 there were seven challengers for the cup competing for the inaugural Louis Vuitton Cup, the winner of which would go on to the America's Cup match against the NYYC's yacht selected in their trials. Bond's yacht, Australia II, designed by Ben Lexcen, skippered by John Bertrand, and representing the Royal Perth Yacht Club, easily won the Louis Vuitton challenger series, and Dennis Conner in Liberty was selected for the Cup defense.|$|E
2500|$|Night falls; now remorseful, she unburies him but cannot {{remember}} where the wrench is. She helps {{him back to}} the cabin, where she tells him she does [...] "not yet" [...] want to kill him, adding that [...] "when the three beggars arrive someone must die." [...] In a flashback [...] she watches Nic climbing up to the window, but she does not act, thus displaying her essential evil much like her hypothesis. In the cabin she cuts off her clitoris with scissors. They are visited by the crow, the deer, and the fox. A hailstorm begins; earlier it had been revealed that women accused of witchcraft had been known to have the power to summon hailstorms. Finding the wrench under the floorboards, he is stabbed by her with the scissors, but is able to <b>unbolt</b> the grindstone. Finally free, he shows a vicious face, and strangles her to death. He then burns her on a funeral pyre.|$|E
60|$|She {{then waited}} a moment or two, whilst he closed both the shutter and the window, she {{standing}} the while on the stone step before the portico. In the stillness she could hear him open the drawing-room door, then cross the hall and finally <b>unbolt</b> the heavy outer door.|$|E
60|$|The {{door was}} unchained and <b>unbolted,</b> and 'Good-night' said. And Sheila swept back in sombre pomp to her absorbed friends.|$|R
60|$|A {{cautious}} rap on {{the iron}} door, {{and it was}} <b>unbolted</b> by Walt Baxter, who {{had been assigned to}} that duty.|$|R
60|$|Peter {{rose and}} softly <b>unbolted</b> the door. The passage outside was in darkness. He listened intently for a moment, and {{returned}} yawning.|$|R
6000|$|... "He can't {{possibly}} get out anywhere, {{and as soon}} we 've cut up the candy, we 'll <b>unbolt</b> the door and run. Come and get a nice dish to put it in," [...] said Fan, when Polly proposed to go halves with Tom, lest he should come bursting in somehow, and seize the whole.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was angry}} {{that she should}} have dared to <b>unbolt</b> the door, or to {{withdraw}} the bars. What was she, that she should be trusted to open or to close the house? And there came upon him some idea of wanton and improper conduct. Why was she there at that hour? Must it be that he should put her again from the shelter of his roof? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{sure you}} do. Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs; <b>unbolt</b> the side-passage door, and tell {{the driver of the}} post-chaise you will see in the yard--or just outside, for I told him not to drive his {{rattling}} wheels over the pavement--to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane, if any one is about, come {{to the foot of the}} stairs and hem." ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A single bicycle wheel remains locked to an {{inverted}} U-rack after the bike has apparently been <b>unbolted</b> from {{the wheel and}} carried away.|$|R
6000|$|... "No--she {{can stay}} only one night," [...] said Hepzibah, <b>unbolting</b> the door. [...] "If Clifford were {{to find her}} here, it might disturb him!" ...|$|R
60|$|Except for my bedroom, whither he {{was quite}} capable of {{following}} me, I had no refuge but the grounds. I <b>unbolted</b> {{the front door and}} went out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your words {{make me a}} happy man," [...] {{answered}} Ramiro. [...] "Allow me to <b>unbolt</b> the door, I {{hear our}} hosts. Worthy Simon and Vrouw, I make you parties to a solemn and joyful celebration. This young man is my son, and in token of my fatherly love, {{which he has been}} pleased to desire, I now take him in my arms and embrace him before you," [...] and he suited the action to the word.|$|E
60|$|He {{heard the}} wheels, {{and went out}} to <b>unbolt</b> the door. Those were a pair for a father to be proud of--Norman, of fine stature and noble looks, with his high brow, clear {{thoughtful}} eye, and grave intellectual eagle face, lighting into animation with his rare, sweet smile; and Flora, so tall and graceful, and in her white dress, picturesquely half concealed by her mantle, with flowers in her hair, and a deepened colour in her cheek, was a fair vision, as she came in from the darkness.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{will most}} likely {{discover}} that you have gone then. When they find the four guards sound asleep, they are sure to <b>unbolt</b> the door {{and see if you}} are there, then of course they will give the alarm at once. But I hardly think they will even attempt to pursue. They are infantry, and none of them are mounted but the officers, which means that at present only Valdez himself has a horse. They would know that you had been assisted, and that probably horses were waiting for you somewhere. There is the hut, señors." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are <b>unbolting</b> {{the door}} into the yard," [...] John Wilkes whispered. [...] "I would give a month's pay to be behind them with a rope's end." ...|$|R
60|$|Softly Yvonne <b>unbolted</b> a small door, and, {{passing through}} it, Agravaine found himself {{looking up at}} the stars, while the great walls of the castle towered above him.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Pickwick paid, {{the door}} was <b>unbolted,</b> and out they came; the uncombed gentleman bestowing a {{friendly}} nod upon Mr. Roker, {{who happened to be}} passing at the moment.|$|R
60|$|The tub {{came down}} by and by, in fact, two of them, {{and those who}} had no shovels bailed up the slimy kernels with their hats and hands; but each time the chain swung through the hatch the tub below was full. It was two o'clock when they desisted, and some of them were waist deep in water then, while soon after they came up the big hose splashed in again. There were steampipe collars to <b>unbolt</b> and pack, and bolt again, before that was done; while when Austin came upon Jefferson, he held up one hand from which the scalded skin was peeling.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is close}} and musty here, {{with all this}} old {{tapestry}} and stuff about; I'll open the other window," [...] she thought; and, noiselessly slipping from Amy's side, she threw on wrapper and slippers, lighted her candle and tried to <b>unbolt</b> the tall, diamond-paned lattice. It was rusty and would not yield, and, giving it up, she glanced about to see whence air could be admitted. There were four doors in the room, all low and arched, with clumsy locks and heavy handles. One opened into a closet, one into the passage; the third was locked, but the fourth opened easily, and, lifting her light, she peeped into a small octagon room, full of all manner of curiosities. What they were she {{had no time to}} see, for her startled eyes were riveted on an object that turned her faint and cold with terror.|$|E
6000|$|No less strange is the soliloquy where Moor, {{with the}} {{instrument}} of self-destruction in his hands, the 'dread key that is to shut behind him the prison of life, and to <b>unbolt</b> before him the dwelling of eternal night,'—meditates on the gloomy enigmas of his future destiny. Soliloquies on this subject are numerous,—from the time of Hamlet, of Cato, and downwards. Perhaps the worst of them has more ingenuity, perhaps {{the best of them}} has less awfulness than the present. St. Dominick himself might shudder at such a question, with such an answer as this: [...] "What if thou shouldst send me companionless to some burnt and blasted circle of the universe; which thou hast banished from thy sight; where the lone darkness and the motionless desert were my prospects—forever? I would people the silent wilderness with my fantasies; I should have Eternity for leisure to examine the perplexed image of the universal woe." ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>unbolted</b> the door, {{called in}} the bearers, wished us good morning, and with a look full of meaning and a crook of his finger at parting went his way.|$|R
6000|$|... 'When I woke this morning, Captain,' said Rob, 'which {{was about}} a quarter after five, I found these on my pillow. The shop-door was <b>unbolted</b> and unlocked, and Mr Gills gone.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hark!" [...] said Ratcliffe, [...] "he calls me--Miss Vere, return home, {{and leave}} <b>unbolted</b> the postern-door of the garden; {{to that which}} opens on the back-stairs I have a private key." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of course, {{being his}} wife, I could publish the fact, and compel him to {{acknowledge}} me at any moment, notwithstanding his threats, and reasonings {{that it will}} be better to wait. I have waited, and waited again, and the time for such acknowledgment seems no nearer than at first. To show you how patiently I have waited I can tell you that not till a fortnight ago, when by stress of circumstances I had been driven to new lodgings, have I ever assumed my married name, solely on account of its having been his request all along that I should not do it. This writing to you, madam, is my first disobedience, and I am justified in it. A woman who is driven to visit her husband like a thief in the night and then sent away like a street dog--left to get up, <b>unbolt,</b> unbar, and find her way out of the house as she best may--is justified in doing anything.|$|E
60|$|There {{was that}} in his manner which she {{knew it would be}} futile to oppose. She said no more, but, turning to her room as meekly as a martyr, heard him go downstairs, <b>unbolt</b> the door, and close it behind him. With a woman's {{disregard}} of her dignity when in the presence of nobody but herself, she also trotted down, sobbing articulately as she went. She listened. She knew exactly how far it was to the inn that Arabella had named as her lodging. It would occupy about seven minutes to get there at an ordinary walking pace; seven to come back again. If he did not return in fourteen minutes he would have lingered. She looked at the clock. It was twenty-five minutes to eleven. He MIGHT enter the inn with Arabella, as they would reach it before closing time; she might get him to drink with her; and Heaven only knew what disasters would befall him then.|$|E
60|$|There was {{something}} of a shudder about Clarence as he went to <b>unbolt</b> the back door; Martyn kept close to him. We saw them outside, and then Emily flew after them. From my window I could watch them advancing on the central gravel walk, Emily standing still between her brothers, clasping an arm of each. I saw the light near the ruin, and caught some sounds as of shrieks and of threatening voices, the light flitted towards the gable of the mullion rooms, and then was the concluding scream. All was over, and the three came back much agitated, Emily sinking into an armchair, panting, her hands over her face, and a nervous trembling through her whole frame, Martyn's eyes looking wide and scared, Clarence with the well-known look of terror on his face. He hurried to fetch the tray of wine and water that was always left on the table when anyone went to a party at night, but he shivered too much to prevent the glasses from jingling, and I had to pour out the sherry and administer it to Emily. 'Oh! poor, poor thing,' she gasped out.|$|E
50|$|Graham flour {{is similar}} to whole wheat flour in that both are made from the whole grain; however graham flour is not sifted during milling (i.e. <b>unbolted),</b> and is ground more coarsely.|$|R
60|$|But {{suddenly}} there came the shuffling of steps outside, {{and he had}} hardly time to wrap the loose links round his free hand, when the door was <b>unbolted</b> and two pirates came in.|$|R
60|$|Miss Heatherstone {{waved her}} hand {{to me with a}} bright smile, and tripped up the avenue, while her brother <b>unbolted</b> the gate, and, passing through, closed it again, locking it upon the outside.|$|R
60|$|She seated {{herself at}} the foot of the bed lost in amazement. She must first think,--she was bound first to think, of his safety; and yet what in the way of {{punishment}} could they do to him comparable to the torments which they could inflict upon her? She listened, and she soon heard Peter Steinmarc creaking in the room below. Tetchen had coughed because Peter was as usual going to his room, but had Ludovic remained at her door no one would have been a bit the wiser. No doubt Ludovic, up among the rafters, was thinking the same thing; but there must be no renewal of their intercourse that night, and therefore Linda bolted her door. As she did so, she swore to herself that she would not <b>unbolt</b> it again that evening at Ludovic's request. No such encroaching request was made to her. She sat for nearly an hour {{at the foot of}} her bed, waiting, listening, fearing, thinking, hoping,--hardly hoping, when another step was heard on the stair and in the passage,--a step which she well knew to be that of her aunt Charlotte. Then she arose, and as her aunt drew near she pulled back the bolt and opened the door. The little oil lamp which she held threw a timid fitful light into the gloom, and Linda looked up unconsciously into the darkness of the roof over her head.|$|E
60|$|Those {{were the}} days when men swooned over the ratchet-drill and the hand-forge, and where they fell they had leave to lie unless their bodies were {{in the way of}} their fellows' feet. And so, patch upon patch, and a patch over all, the {{starboard}} supporting-column was clouted; but when they thought all was secure, Mr. Wardrop decreed that the noble patchwork would never support working engines; at the best, it could only hold the guide-bars approximately true, he deadweight of the cylinders must be borne by vertical struts; and, therefore, a gang would repair to the bows, and take out, with files, the big bow-anchor davits, each of which was some three inches in diameter. They threw hot coals at Wardrop, and threatened to kill him, those who did not weep (they were ready to weep on the least provocation); but he hit them with iron bars heated at the end, and they limped forward, and the davits came with them when they returned. They slept sixteen hours on the strength of it, and in three days two struts were in place, bolted from the foot of the starboard supporting-column to the under side of the cylinder. There remained now the port, or condenser-column, which, though not so badly cracked as its fellow, had also been strengthened in four places with boiler-plate patches, but needed struts. They took away the main stanchions of the bridge for that work, and, crazy with toil, did not see till all was in place that the rounded bars of iron must be flattened from top to bottom to allow the air-pump levers to clear them. It was Wardrop's oversight, and he wept bitterly before the men as he gave the order to <b>unbolt</b> the struts and flatten them with hammer and the flame. Now the broken engine was underpinned firmly, and they took away the wooden shores from under the cylinders, and gave them to the robbed bridge, thanking God for even half a day's work on gentle, kindly wood instead of the iron that had entered into their souls. Eight months in the back-country among the leeches, at a temperature of 84 degrees moist, is very bad for the nerves.|$|E
60|$|This thought held me {{sufficiently}} {{to make me}} cross to his threshold and pause again. I preternaturally listened; I figured to myself what might portentously be; I wondered if his bed were also empty and he too were secretly at watch. It was a deep, soundless minute, {{at the end of}} which my impulse failed. He was quiet; he might be innocent; the risk was hideous; I turned away. There was a figure in the grounds--a figure prowling for a sight, the visitor with whom Flora was engaged; but it was not the visitor most concerned with my boy. I hesitated afresh, but on other grounds and only for a few seconds; then I had made my choice. There were empty rooms at Bly, and it was only a question of choosing the right one. The right one suddenly presented itself to me as the lower one--though high above the gardens--in the solid corner of the house that I have spoken of as the old tower. This was a large, square chamber, arranged with some state as a bedroom, the extravagant size of which made it so inconvenient that it had not for years, though kept by Mrs. Grose in exemplary order, been occupied. I had often admired it and I knew my way about in it; I had only, after just faltering at the first chill gloom of its disuse, to pass across it and <b>unbolt</b> as quietly as I could one of the shutters. Achieving this transit, I uncovered the glass without a sound and, applying my face to the pane, was able, the darkness without being much less than within, to see that I commanded the right direction. Then I saw something more. The moon made the night extraordinarily penetrable and showed me on the lawn a person, diminished by distance, who stood there motionless and as if fascinated, looking up to where I had appeared--looking, that is, not so much straight at me as at something that was apparently above me. There was clearly another person above me--there was a person on the tower; but the presence on the lawn was not in the least what I had conceived and had confidently hurried to meet. The presence on the lawn--I felt sick as I made it out--was poor little Miles himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll let you in, uncle; wait a moment," [...] said Lily, as she <b>unbolted</b> {{the window}} which opened out upon the lawn. [...] "It's dreadfully cold, so come in {{as fast as}} you can." ...|$|R
60|$|He stood up--she <b>unbolted</b> {{the back}} door, and looked out. A cold, raw night, not yet dawn, {{with a piece}} of a moon in the vague sky. She was glad she need not go out.|$|R
60|$|Felix rose at once; and his Shadow, rising before him, and <b>unbolting</b> {{the loose}} wooden {{fastener}} of the door, {{went out in}} haste to see who called beyond the white taboo-line of their sacred precincts.|$|R
