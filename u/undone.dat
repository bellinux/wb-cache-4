5|$|At the 36th GMA Dove Awards, <b>Undone</b> won {{the award}} for Pop/Contemporary Album of the Year.|$|E
5|$|<b>Undone</b> {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics with many praising the album's personal style, although some critics argued the album's songwriting and sound were too similar to MercyMe's previous efforts. It won the GMA Dove Award for Pop/Contemporary Album of the Year at the 36th GMA Dove Awards. In the United States, <b>Undone</b> debuted at No. 12 on the Billboard 200 and at No. 1 on the Billboard Christian Albums chart, selling over 55,000 copies {{in its first}} week. It spent a total of two weeks atop the Christian Albums chart and was the fifth-best selling Christian album of 2004 and the fourteenth best-selling Christian album of 2005. <b>Undone</b> has sold over 627,000 albums in the United States and was the thirty-eighth best-selling Christian album of the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Since, O Lord, almighty {{and most}} merciful God, thou hast {{satisfied}} us with thy gifts, ensure from henceforth {{that we may}} diligently regard what thou wishest to be done or left <b>undone</b> by us and cause this to be effected with sincere heart, through Jesus Christ our Lord.|$|E
5|$|The reforms instituted by the Great Sejm and the Constitution of May 3, 1791, were <b>undone</b> by the Targowica Confederation and the {{intervention}} of the Russian Empire at the invitation of the Targowica Confederates.|$|E
5|$|A {{volatile}} {{member of}} the team, <b>undone</b> by years of combat stress and alcohol abuse. Lundgren's personal history (including his chemical engineering degree) were incorporated into the character's story by Stallone. Lundgren was hesitant {{to participate in the}} film based on the first script draft; however, rewrites and additional content for his character changed his mind.|$|E
5|$|Never {{was there}} such a dame school as ours, so firm and kind and smelling of galoshes, with the sweet and fumbled music of the piano lessons {{drifting}} down from upstairs to the lonely schoolroom, where only the sometimes tearful wicked sat over <b>undone</b> sums, or to repent a little crime– the pulling of a girl's hair during geography, the sly shin kick under the table during English literature.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the case}} has not been {{formally}} overruled, two Supreme Court decisions in the 1970s and 1980s have <b>undone</b> its effect by ruling that there is federal subject-matter jurisdiction for a federal common law cause of action for recovering possession based on the common-law doctrine of aboriginal title. Moreover, the New York courts' interpretation of the Nonintercourse Act is no longer good law. Modern federal courts hold that only Congress can ratify a conveyance of aboriginal title, and only with a clear statement, rather than implicitly.|$|E
5|$|Boot {{wrote for}} the CFR through 2010 and 2011 for various {{publications}} such as Newsweek, The Boston Globe, The New York Times, and The Weekly Standard among others. He particularly argued that President Obama's health care plans made maintaining the U.S.' superpower status harder, that withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq occurred prematurely while making another war there more likely, and that the initial U.S. victory in Afghanistan had been <b>undone</b> by government complacency though forces could still pull off a victory. He also wrote op-eds criticizing planned budget austerity measures in both the U.S. and the U.K. as hurting their national security interests.|$|E
5|$|During {{the clay}} season, Federer's {{victory in the}} Hamburg Masters final was {{particularly}} impressive, as it snapped Rafael Nadal's 81-match winning streak on clay, an Open-Era record. Federer turned the match around from a set down to sweep 12 of the final 14 games, including a final set bagel. At the French Open, some anticipated that Federer could become the first man in almost 40 years to hold all four majors simultaneously, having just resoundingly defeated young rival Nadal on clay entering the tournament. However, in {{a repeat of the}} previous year Federer played a tough four-set final against Nadal, but was <b>undone</b> by going 1/17 on break-point chances.|$|E
5|$|Failed {{oxygen and}} {{ethylene}} glycol pipes near the fire's origin point continued burning an intense secondary fire which melted through the cabin floor. By the time firefighters {{were able to}} open the hatch, the fire had extinguished itself. The back of Chaffee's couch {{was found in the}} horizontal position, with the lower portion angled towards the floor. His helmet was closed and locked, his restraints were <b>undone,</b> and the hoses and electrical connections to the suit remained connected. As he was farthest from the origin of the fire, he suffered the least burn and suit damage.|$|E
5|$|In Murray, Virginia, the Holvey family {{visits a}} local {{amusement}} park. When the youngest child, Teddy, lets his balloon fly away, his father, Steve, {{gives him the}} balloon that belongs to his older brother, Charlie (Joel Palmer). When the boys' mother, Maggie (Helene Clarkson), is in the bathroom, the strap in Teddy's stroller comes <b>undone.</b> Teddy follows the balloon floating under its own power out of the restroom and onto the tracks of the park's tour train, leading to him getting killed by the train. Charlie is {{the only member of}} the Holvey family not to grieve Teddy's death at the scene.|$|E
5|$|Landing on the island, Johnny and Zatch {{lead the}} attack on the royal city, taking down Chi's henchmen and freeing Mac. Johnny confronts Colonel Chi, {{successfully}} defeating him by knocking him into a body of water with the help of Adam and his Game Gear. With Chi's rule <b>undone,</b> peace is restored to Patusan. Johnny is seated as the heralded warrior prince with Ro-May as his princess and Adam as a prince. Johnny declares the monarchy to be dissolved and announces that Patusan will operate as a democracy. His reason for doing this is for the people to finally be free of rule, good or evil.|$|E
5|$|Peking opera was {{denounced as}} 'feudalistic' and 'bourgeois' during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s, and {{replaced}} with the eight revolutionary model operas {{as a means of}} propaganda and indoctrination. After the Cultural Revolution, these transformations were largely <b>undone.</b> In recent years, Peking opera has attempted numerous reforms in response to sagging audience numbers. These reforms, which include improving performance quality, adapting new performance elements, and performing new and original plays, have met with mixed success.|$|E
5|$|The Maratha {{gains in}} the north were <b>undone</b> because of the {{contradictory}} policies of Holkar and Shinde and the internal disputes in {{the family of the}} Peshwa, which culminated in the murder of Narayanrao Peshwa in 1773. Due to this, the Marathas virtually disappeared from north India. Raghunathrao was ousted from the seat of Peshwa due to continuing internal Maratha rivalries. He sought help from the British, and they signed the Treaty of Surat with him in March 1775. This treaty gave him military assistance in exchange for control of Salsette Island and Bassein Fort.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the episode {{primarily}} deal with Lord Eddard Stark's investigations into {{the death of the}} previous Hand. In the city of King's Landing, the Tourney of the Hand comes to an end while the various factions that plot for power are revealed to the viewer. This delicate balance is <b>undone</b> when news arrives that Tyrion Lannister has been arrested by Catelyn Stark. The title of the episode refers {{to the fact that the}} Starks, whose sigil is a wolf, may soon be at war with the Lannisters, whose sigil is the lion.|$|E
5|$|<b>Undone</b> is {{the third}} studio album by Christian rock band, MercyMe. It was {{produced}} by Pete Kipley and released on April 20, 2004 on INO Records. Following the success of MercyMe's previous studio efforts, they were given significantly more resources with which to develop the album and brought in a sixth member, guitarist Barry Graul. Unlike the band's previous songwriting style, which was to write the lyrics first, they wrote the music for the songs on the album before writing the lyrics. The album has a pop rock and adult contemporary sound, while the lyrics are personal and convey Christian themes.|$|E
5|$|As 1997 {{turned to}} 1998, an {{inspirational}} performance from Giggs helped a modest United side labour for a hard-earned three points and still maintain {{their desire for}} a fifth title in six seasons. A trip to the Dell to play Southampton – where United were <b>undone</b> last season repeated itself, this time by a solitary Kevin Davies goal in the third minute. The Saints pulled off a valiant performance, most notably from goalkeeper Paul Jones, who denied Solskjær from scoring right at {{the death of the}} second half. Things went from bad to worse in January as Tony Cottee popped in to stun Old Trafford and score the winner for Leicester in what proved a wretched season for the striker. This was the Foxes first win in the league since November and United's first home defeat of the season and fifth altogether.|$|E
5|$|Gloucestershire {{went over}} the Pennines to Sheffield and began the next game against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane on Monday, 29 July. Gloucestershire were soundly beaten by 244 runs, a big margin at the time. Yorkshire scored 158 and 360; Gloucestershire scored 201 to claim a good first innings lead but were then bowled out for 73 and crashed to a heavy defeat. Grace batted quite well, scoring 62 and 35. With the ball, he took 2–48 and 4–128. They were <b>undone</b> by the bowling of Billy Bates who took 11 wickets in the match, {{including}} 7–38 in the second innings; while George Ulyett and Ephraim Lockwood both scored centuries in Yorkshire's second innings. The match was played {{for the benefit of}} Tom Emmett, who received £616 13s 1d.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{believed}} the aircraft captain survived {{for a short}} time after the crash. His body was a short distance away from his seat and both were a few metres ahead of the wreckage where they had been thrown after the nose of the aircraft was split open in the impact with a large tree. The seat belt had not broken, but it had been <b>undone.</b> The captain's tunic was pulled up over his head as though to protect his face from the heat of the nearby inferno. Investigators believed he survived the crash and undid his seat belt to drag himself away from the fire. His body was not burnt, but autopsy showed both his legs were broken and he died from a fractured skull.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, 13 May, the French were <b>undone</b> {{by their}} poor tactical deployment. They strung their armour {{out in a}} thin line between Hannut and Huy, leaving no defence in depth, which {{was the point of}} sending the French armour to the Gembloux gap in the first place. This left Hoepner with a chance to mass against one of the French Light Divisions (the 3e DLM) and achieve a breakthrough in that sector. Moreover, with no reserves behind the front, the French denied themselves the chance of a counterattack. The victory saw the Panzer Corps out-manoeuvre the 2e DLM on its left flank. The Belgian III Corps, retreating from Liege, offered to support the French front held by the 3e DLM. This offer was rejected.|$|E
5|$|Truce {{terms are}} {{recorded}} {{as having been}} used in the following circumstances; being out of breath, having a stitch, a shoelace being <b>undone,</b> fear of clothes being damaged, needing to go to the lavatory, checking the time, wanting to discuss or clarify rules during a fight or game, or one combatant wanting to remove their spectacles or jacket before continuing. It does not mean to surrender, although it may sometimes be used in preparation to surrendering. Truce terms are only used within a specific age group, have little currency outside that group and are by and large abandoned by the age of 10 or 11 years. However, research into early recorded use of these terms found examples of some of these terms being used as a sign of surrender in battle or adult fights or quarrels as late as the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{defeating}} the eight Robot Masters — Toad Man, Bright Man, Pharaoh Man, Ring Man, Dust Man, Skull Man, Dive Man, and Drill Man — Mega Man {{makes his way}} to Cossack's icy fortress. However, {{in the middle of his}} battle with Cossack, Mega Man's brother Proto Man teleports in with Cossack's daughter, Kalinka. The girl begs Mega Man to stop fighting her father and elaborating that Dr. Wily had kidnapped her and forced her father into building an army of robots. With Wily's plan <b>undone</b> by Proto Man, he steps out of the shadows. Mega Man pursues his nemesis and fights through the scientist's Wily Castle, but Wily manages to escape in the end. Mega Man escapes as the fortress begins to self-destruct, and rides home on the top of a passing train, where he is greeted by Roll and Rush.|$|E
5|$|Barbarian King Alrik– The former {{ruler of}} {{a horde of}} barbarians. As the {{champion}} of Hades, he sought the Ambrosia to save his ailing father. Alrik was ultimately unsuccessful and was killed by Kratos. Resurrected by Hades, Prince Alrik learned that he had become King {{after the death of}} his father. Alrik sought vengeance against Kratos, and his barbarian horde threatened to overwhelm Kratos' opposing Spartan army. Alrik almost killed Kratos in combat, but this was <b>undone</b> at the critical moment when Kratos offered up his life to Ares and was returned to battle equipped with the Blades of Chaos, which Kratos used to decapitate Alrik. Alrik eventually fought his way out of the Underworld, and intent on revenge, found and confronted Kratos on the Island of Creation. Kratos killed the Barbarian King once again, and took his hammer. The character was voiced by Bob Joles in God of War II, and Fred Tatasciore in God of War III during the psyche sequence.|$|E
5|$|Left <b>undone,</b> however, was {{extending}} the laws dealing with surveying and registering land claims with the registrar {{of the state}} land office. Cognizant that the old law would expire November 30, 1797, Garrard issued a proclamation on November 3 calling the legislature into special session. The legislators convened on November 28, and Garrard, drawing on {{his experience as a}} surveyor, addressed them regarding the urgency of adopting a new law and forestalling more lawsuits related to land claims, which were already numerous. Although a wealthy landowner himself, Garrard advocated protecting Kentucky's large debtor class from foreclosure on their lands. Garrard supported pro-squatting legislation, including measures that forbade the collection of taxes from squatters on profits they made from working the land they occupied and that required landowners to pay squatters for any improvements they made on their land. Despite opposition from some aristocratic legislators like John Breckinridge, most of the reforms advocated by Garrard were approved in the session.|$|E
5|$|Research into medieval foodways was, until around 1980, a much {{neglected}} {{field of}} study. Misconceptions and outright errors were common among historians, {{and are still}} present in {{as a part of}} the popular view of the Middle Ages as a backward, primitive and barbaric era. Medieval cookery was described as revolting due to the often unfamiliar combination of flavors, the perceived lack of vegetables and a liberal use of spices. The heavy use of spices has been popular as an argument to support the claim that spices were employed to disguise the flavor of spoiled meat, a conclusion without support in historical fact and contemporary sources. Fresh meat could be procured throughout the year by those who could afford it. The preservation techniques available at the time, although crude by today's standards, were perfectly adequate. The astronomical cost and high prestige of spices, and thereby the reputation of the host, would have been effectively <b>undone</b> if wasted on cheap and poorly handled foods.|$|E
5|$|Ryan's budget plans {{proposed}} privatizing Medicare {{for those}} {{under the age}} of 55, and funding Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program through block grants to the states. In 2012 Ryan proposed that Medicaid be converted into block grants, but with the federal government's share of the cost cut by some $800 billion over the next decade. Currently, Medicaid is administered by the states, subject to federal rules concerning eligibility, and the amount paid by the federal government depends on {{the number of people who}} qualify. His plan would have <b>undone</b> a Reagan-era reform by which the federal government prohibited the states from requiring that a patient's spouse, as well as the patient, deplete all of his or her assets before Medicaid would cover long-term care. Ryan’s budget plan proposed raising the Medicare eligibility age, beginning in 2023, by two months a year, until it reached 67 in 2034. A 2011 analysis, conducted by the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research group, for the Kaiser Family Foundation, estimated that Ryan's 2011 plan would have resulted in 14 million to 27 million fewer people receiving Medicaid coverage by 2021.|$|E
5|$|Six {{days after}} the attack on Centaur, a request {{was made by the}} Australian Department of Defence that the {{identification}} markings and lights be removed from Australian hospital ship Manunda, weapons be installed, and that she begin to sail blacked out and under escort. The conversion was performed, although efforts by the Department of the Navy, the Admiralty, and authorities in New Zealand and the United States of America caused the completed conversion to be <b>undone.</b> The cost of the roundabout work came to £12,500, and kept Manunda out of service for three months. On 9 June 1943, communications between the Combined Chiefs of Staff on the subject of hospital ships contained a section referring to the Manunda incident {{as a response to the}} attack on Centaur, with the conclusion that the attack was the work of an irresponsible Japanese commander, and that it would be better to wait until further attacks had been made before considering the removal of hospital ship markings.|$|E
5|$|Superman the Ride has {{undergone}} numerous safety upgrades. After the 2001 incident, the PVC airlines were replaced with steel reinforced air hoses {{to prevent a}} similar accident from occurring. After the 2004 incident, metal bars were installed {{on both sides of}} the “T-bar” restraint, encasing the rider's legs. Shin restraints were added to the lower portion of the restraint, preventing riders’ feet from leaving the car. In addition, all of the seat belts on both 36-passenger trains were replaced with ones at a consistent length, as well as a “go or no go” belt for each seat and “T-bar” restraint. The “go or no go” belt ensured the “T-bar” restraint was in an effective position before leaving the station. During the 2009 rebranding, new trains were deployed with new restraints added. The new lapbars eliminated the center pole, leaving only the exterior poles. New seat belts provided more strength and were less likely to come <b>undone</b> unintentionally.|$|E
5|$|The Siege of Kamarja {{was fought}} in 729 between the Arab Muslims of the Umayyad Caliphate and the Turgesh khaganate, {{along with its}} Soghdian allies. The Umayyad conquest of Transoxiana had been <b>undone</b> in the 720s by the uprisings of the local Soghdian princes and the Turgesh invasions. By 729, the small {{fortress}} of Kamarja near Samarkand (in modern Uzbekistan) {{was one of the}} last remaining Arab strongholds in Transoxiana, when it was attacked by the Turgesh under the personal direction of their ruler, Suluk. The subsequent siege, for which a detailed account survives in the history of al-Tabari, lasted for 58 days and ended with the negotiated withdrawal of its garrison to Samarkand. The stubborn defence of Kamarja was celebrated in Arabic literature, but the Arab hold over the region was broken after the Battle of the Defile two years later. It was only following the collapse of the Turgesh khaganate after 738 that the Arabs re-established their rule over Transoxiana.|$|E
5|$|The case {{first went}} to the High Court of Justice, where it was heard by Fulford J; {{he decided that he}} did not have the {{authority}} to overrule Bonnard, and passed the case on to the Court of Appeal after granting a temporary injunction. In the Court of Appeal, the case was heard by May, Dyson and Brooke LJJ, with Brooke delivering the judgment on 5 November 2004. In it, Brooke judged that defamation, the subject of Greene, was significantly different from breach of confidentiality, the subject in Cream. While the damage from a breach of confidentiality can never be <b>undone,</b> justifiying a simple test for issuing injunctions, a defamation case that is won vindicates the injured party. Making it easier to grant injunctions in defamation cases would damage the delicate balance between freedom of the press and the right to privacy; as such, despite the Human Rights Act, Bonnard is still a valid test.|$|E
5|$|As {{a form of}} express trust, {{charitable}} trusts {{are subject}} to certain formalities, {{as well as the}} requirements of the three certainties, when being created. These vary depending on whether the gift that creates the trust is given in life, given after death, or includes land. If the gift is given after death through a will, the will must comply with Section 9 of the Wills Act 1837, which requires that the will be in writing and signed by the testator (or somebody else present, at the testator's instruction), {{it is clear that the}} testator intended to give effect to the will, and the signature is made or noted by two or more witnesses. If these are all carried out, the will is a valid document, and the gift made as part of it can create a charitable trust. If the gift is of land and made during the donor's lifetime, it must comply with Section 53(1)(b) of the Law of Property Act 1925, which requires that the agreement be a written document signed by the person giving it. If the gift is of personal property and made inter vivos, there are no formal requirements; it is enough that an oral declaration is made creating the trust. Once constituted properly, a charitable trust, like all express trusts, cannot be <b>undone</b> unless there is something allowing that within the trust instrument.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{incursion}} was countered by the RAR, {{but after a}} tactical error in its third engagement with the guerrillas led to casualties, the African Rifles were joined by 2 Commando, RLI on 25 August 1967. The insurgents were consistently <b>undone</b> in their incursions by the suspicion of Rhodesia's rural blacks, whose tribal chiefs and headmen would often work together to inform the police and security forces of the infiltrators' presence. This proved to be no exception: when a cadre visited a local kraal early on 31 August to obtain food, an old woman invited him to stay and kept him there while she sent a young girl to alert the security forces. 7 Troop, 2 Commando arrived at 07:20 and captured the insurgent, who then guided 7 Troop, led by Lieutenant Charl Viljoen, and a platoon of RAR men to where his five comrades were encamped. The combined force surrounded the guerrillas and opened fire, killing four; the fifth escaped and returned to Zambia. The next day, on 1 September, some 2 Commando troops in ambush were informed by a tractor driver {{that he had been}} given money by 14 guerrillas the previous night to buy mielie-meal for them, and that they would be collecting it from him at his kraal that evening. A sweep was planned; the tractor driver was briefed and returned to the kraal with the mielie-meal while 2 Commando and the RAR formed a cordon around it. The following morning the soldiers performed their sweep but failed to find the enemy, who were already gone. The insurgents, who were actually 17 in number and all South African Umkhonto fighters, crossed the border into Botswana and were arrested there on 3 September. Of the 79 cadres who had crossed the border on 1 August, 29 were killed and 17 captured within Rhodesia, 29 were arrested in Botswana, where one also died, one was arrested in Durban and one escaped back to Zambia. One remained unaccounted for. Nickel was officially closed at 06:00 on 8 September 1967.|$|E
5|$|From {{at least}} {{the time of the}} Pyramid Texts, kings hoped that after their deaths they could emulate Osiris's {{restoration}} to life and his rule over the realm of the dead. By the early Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BCE), non-royal Egyptians believed that they, too, could overcome death as Osiris had, by worshipping him and receiving the funerary rites that were partly based on his myth. Osiris thus became Egypt's most important afterlife deity. The myth also influenced the notion, which grew prominent in the New Kingdom, that only virtuous people could reach the afterlife. As the assembled deities judged Osiris and Horus to be in the right, undoing the injustice of Osiris's death, so a deceased soul had to be judged righteous in order for his or her death to be <b>undone.</b> As ruler of the land of the dead and as a god connected with maat, Osiris became the judge in this posthumous trial, offering life after death to those who followed his example. New Kingdom funerary texts such as the Amduat and the Book of Gates liken Ra himself to a deceased soul. In them, he travels through the Duat and unites with Osiris to be reborn at dawn. Thus, Osiris was not only believed to enable rebirth for the dead; he renewed the sun, the source of life and maat, and thus renewed the world itself.|$|E
5|$|Jeremy travels back to {{the ruins}} from the {{beginning}} of the game, only to find that the army of Rome has beaten him there. Jeremy and Alysa meet the First Paladin in the Blood Seal's resting chamber. The Paladin explains that he wishes to destroy the seal, causing a great deluge that will bring the people, who had stopped believing the Church's teachings, back under the Church's influence. Jeremy refuses to allow the Paladin to do this, and the Paladin attacks. After being injured, the Paladin pulls back and Castello appears and attacks. Jeremy and Alysa kill Castello, and the Paladin re-enters the fight. Jeremy and Alysa appear to severely wound the First Paladin, but he boasts that vampires cannot kill him, as he is under the protection of Rome. Bartholomew emerges from behind the Blood Seal's resting place and slits the First Paladin's throat from behind, killing him. Bartholomew claims that although the Blood Seal was destroyed in battle, the moon will heal itself. He reveals that while he has heard that it can be done, he does not personally know how to turn Jeremy back into a human, and unless he is human, the bond between him and Alysa cannot be <b>undone.</b> The game ends with Jeremy and Alysa agreeing to work together to find a way to reverse Jeremy's transformation into a vampire.|$|E
