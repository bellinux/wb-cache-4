25|$|Dust mites are a nesting {{species that}} prefers a dark, warm, and humid climate. They {{flourish}} in mattresses, bedding, <b>upholstered</b> <b>furniture,</b> and carpets. Their feces include enzymes that are released upon {{contact with a}} moist surface, which can happen when a person inhales, and these enzymes can kill cells within the human body. House dust mites did not become a problem until humans began to use textiles, such as western style blankets and clothing.|$|E

[...] The first, the Green Parlor, was designed for entertaining guests, hosting teas, and special occasions. It was furnished with green rugs, <b>upholstered</b> <b>furniture,</b> and lightly tinted, translucent green window draperies. The room contained an 1840 harp made in France which was the property of Mother Angela Lincoln (a relative of Abraham Lincoln) and a baby grand piano manufactured by the Steinway company.

The suite consisted of a sitting room, bedroom, and bath room. The sitting room was furnished with finely carved dark oak furniture and bookcases retrieved from St. Peter's Mission, and the bedroom with dressers made of cherry.|$|E
2500|$|The {{conservation}} and restoration of textiles {{refers to the}} processes by which textiles are cared for and maintained to be preserved from future damage. [...] The field falls {{under the category of}} art conservation as well as library preservation, {{depending on the type of}} collection. [...] In this case, the concept of textile preservation applies to a wide range of artifacts, including tapestries, carpets, quilts, clothing, flags and curtains, as well as objects which ‘’contain’’ textiles, such as <b>upholstered</b> <b>furniture,</b> dolls, and accessories such as fans, parasols, gloves and hats or bonnets. [...] Many of these artifacts require specialized care, often by a professional conservator. [...] The goal of this article is to provide a general overview of the textile preservation process, and to serve as a jumping-off point for further research into more specialized care. [...] Always contact a professional conservator if you are unsure of how to proceed in the preservation process.|$|E

2500|$|Ebbitt House {{struggled}} {{to compete against}} the larger and more lavish Willard Hotel and the Raleigh Hotel (built in 1893). From the late 1860s until the 1910s, it was considered [...] "Army and Navy Headquarters" [...] {{because of the number}} of military personnel who lived there and the large number of veterans' meetings held there. In November 1889, Caleb Willard hired Henry C. Burch and Charles E. Gibbs (both veteran hotel managers in the city) to run Ebbitt House. Over the next two years, Burch and Gibbs completely refurnished all the rooms (adding new furniture and Belgian carpets), re-papered or added painted frescoes to the ceilings, and installed new furniture in the hallways. [...] On the east side was the now-famous Red Parlor, a gentleman's lounge fitted with rich red and gold draperies, fabric wall coverings, and <b>upholstered</b> <b>furniture.</b> [...] The restaurant, called [...] "cheerful and sunny" [...] by the Washington Post, fronted onto 14th Street NW, was lit with crystal chandeliers, and could seat up to 225 people. [...] It was completely remodeled by Burch and Gibbs: guests dined at tables set with tablecloths imported from Scotland, using Haviland & Co. Limoges porcelain china, silver-handled knives and forks manufactured by Reed & Barton, and Bohemian glassware. [...] Cut-glass flower vases, finger bowls, and water bottles were used for serving. [...] Diners sat in high-backed leather chairs. [...] At breakfast, the waiters wore brown cutaway jackets, vests, and pants with a gold stripe, while in the evening they changed into black tuxedos. [...] The kitchen was renovated, with new steam tables and massive coffee urns (manufactured by Brambull, Deane & Co. of New York City) installed. [...] The menu — served buffet-style — included Blue Point oysters, green sea turtle, Kennebec River salmon, mutton, chicken, hominy fritters, stewed diamondback terrapin, canvasback duck, English pheasant, and a variety of vegetables, fruits, cheese, crackers, nuts, pies, and puddings. [...] Wines, whiskeys, and brandies were served from two large storerooms. Despite the success of the changes, Gibbs left Ebbitt House in 1893 after purchasing Wormley's Hotel. Burch became the sole manager of the hotel. He conducted extensive renovations to the exterior of the hotel in 1895. An enormous two-story mansard roof, with central and corner pavilions influenced by the French Beaux-Arts movement, was added to the top floor, replacing the original single-story, restrained mansard roof.|$|E

For the past twenty-eight years, my research and art has focused on learning its traditions and handweaving practice. Besides studying textile archives, I have more importantly visited the few remaining ateliers and have interviewed the artisans to learned about their training, methods and activities. How do they control the tension of the pile warp?How do they prevent crushing the woven velvet while {{it is on the}} loom?How do they cut the pile loops?How do they control the pattern and design?How does the choice of ground weave effect the cloth?How were they trained and how do they train? My research has taken me to seven countries (Italy, France, England, Japan, China, Turkey and Uzbekistan) where I have found 16 ateliers that still weave velvet. About thirty-five silk velvet weavers remain. My quest started at the Foundation Lisio in Florence, Italy where I worked with Vittorio Rettori on manual Jacquard handlooms.
