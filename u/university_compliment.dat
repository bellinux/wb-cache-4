The <b>University</b> <b>complimented</b> him on his zeal in hunting down this woman [...] "whose venom had {{infected}} the faithful of the whole West," [...] and as recompense it as good as promised him [...] "a crown of imperishable glory in heaven." [...] Only that!--a crown in heaven; a promissory note and no indorser; always something away off yonder; not {{a word about the}} Archbishopric of Rouen, which was the thing Cauchon was destroying his soul for. A crown in heaven; it must have sounded like a sarcasm to him, after all his hard work. What should he do in heaven? he did not know anybody there.|$|R
25|$|In 1937, Ahn {{was invited}} to Dublin, Ireland, to perform Symphonic Fantasy Korea. It easily won the Irish audience, as Ireland had been under British rule just as Korea was under the Japanese rule. He {{then went back to}} Vienna and met with the famous {{composer}} Richard Strauss to discuss his Symphonic Fantasy Korea. At the same time, Ahn was attending the Eötvös Loránd University on a scholarship from the Hungarian government, and, in 1939, Ahn graduated from the <b>University.</b> <b>Complimenting</b> Ahn on his talent, Strauss appointed Ahn to conduct a concert in Budapest in place of himself. Unfortunately, Ahn had spent so many hours in preparing for the concert that he collapsed during the last song. Despite this, the Hungarian newspapers praised Ahn for his efforts. At Strauss's recommendation, the Rome Philharmonic Orchestra gladly accepted Ahn as its conductor; many other orchestras across Europe followed, and Ahn travelled all over Europe to perform.|$|R

5000|$|As provost, Erickson {{was named}} interim President of Penn State to replace Graham Spanier. Initial plans called for Erickson {{to stay on}} only until a {{permanent}} successor could be found. However, on November 17, 2011, the Board of Trustees removed the [...] "interim" [...] tag from Erickson's title and formally named him as Penn State's president. It is very unusual for American universities, especially major research universities like Penn State, to promote someone to the presidency from within. However, several trustees felt that given {{the gravity of the}} sex abuse scandal, Erickson would provide a measure of stability. Additionally, University of Virginia economist David Breneman believed it unlikely [...] "anybody worth getting" [...] would even consider the post if Penn State mounted a national search. Terry Hartles of the American Council of Education believed that the move was necessary as the institution needed [...] "stable, effective leadership" [...] and not a year-long search for a successor. Erickson received support from trustees of the <b>university,</b> who <b>complimented</b> his knowledge of academic administration and openness.|$|R
40|$|Group at Indiana <b>University</b> {{appreciates the}} <b>compliments.</b> Students from 10 {{historically}} black colleges and universities (HBCUs) recently visited IU to learn how to create a K- 12 program based on Just Be, an IU outreach initiative that sends students to schools to challenge stereotypes about computer scientists (www. cs. indiana. edu/cgi-pub/wic/outreach/ index. php). Our long-term goal is to build a pipeline of underrepresented students from high schools to graduate schools, with outreach programs at each of the 10 HBCUs serving as a crucial middle link. The glue that holds the pipeline together is a mutual and collaborative effort to develop outreach programs at each of the 10 HBCUs. The HBCUs will benefit from increased visibility as their students go out into the commu-Bring IT On! teaches HBCU students to create K- 12 outreach program...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three independent musical compositions that represent a diversity of my compositional interests. The first work is titled Song of the Morrígan and is written for chamber orchestra with piano and two percussionists. The Morrígan is a figure from Irish mythology, a goddess of battle, strife, and fertility. While the Morrígan has conflicting roles and forms in Irish mythology, the most common {{is that of a}} war goddess. In this role, like the Norse Valkyries, the Morrígan intervenes in battle to choose which warrior will live and which will die. The Morrígan often {{takes the form of a}} crow or a raven, whose presence can represent both as an omen or a curse. Musically, the concept for Song of the Morrígan was one of relentless rhythmic motion., driven by rhythm. The second piece, entitled Cries of Revelations, is scored for SATB chorus, soloists, string orchestra, horn, and 6 channel electronics. This piece is framed about two apocalyptical texts; the first is Revelation, from the Christian Bible. The second text is taken from 19 th century Scottish Christian mystic Margaret MacDonald, who wrote Christian visionary texts, reminiscent of the visions of Hildegard of Bingen. McDonald's text offers multi-layered thematic material and imagery with which to shape this musical work as a contemporary statement of relevance. I set this text in contrast with passages from the Book of Revelation, which occupy the first half of the piece. The Revelation text prepares the listener with vivid imagery of the second coming, which concludes with verses that call for preparation for the end times. The Sacred Minimalist music of the 1970 s and 80 s, most specifically Arvo Pärt, has heavily influenced my choral compositions. Cries of Revelation similarly explores music of contemplation and diatonic and modal tonality, drawing on Renaissance polyphony and musical idioms such as hocket and Renaissance cadential and voice- leading procedures. The musical form of Cries of Revelation is dictated by the contrasting texts, which divides the work into two tonal centers. Each section takes on the character of the text, the first being violent, dramatic, and relatively dissonant. The second section is one of tonal resignation in the face of man's helplessness in the face of the unknown. Finally, the third piece of this dissertation is a solo work entitled Fragments of a Dream, for 5. 1 surround sound electronics with video by visual artist Christian Faur of Denison University. Fragments of a Dream exists in that place between awake and sleep, the !	"#! hypnopomic state that leads us out of dreams. Consciousness bleeds into our dream state, colors and images of dreams and nightmares mix and clash with hints of awakeness. The concept of this work is framed around the transient, endless possibilities that dreams represent. In this place, imagination runs freely and seemingly unrelated events and images combine, contrast, and transition without boundaries. The primary sound engines in Fragments of a Dream synthesize hundreds of diverse found and sampled sounds through granular synthesis. Some of the samples used in this work include birdcalls, machinery, various animal sounds, water droplets, human vocalizations, singing bowls, and Tibetan singing bowls. Fragments of a Dream was assembled, mixed and mastered in Logic Pro. A video by visual artist Christian Faur of Denison <b>University</b> <b>compliments</b> the live performance. Dissertatio...|$|R

40|$|The solar {{radiation}} over Osogbo (7 ° 47 "N, 4 ° 29 "E), a typical town in South West Nigeria, was estimated from measured sunshine hours {{with a view}} to determining the available solar energy for deployment of solar photovoltaic technology applications. The sunshine hours' data were obtained from Nigerian Meteorological Office (NIMET), Osogbo. The monthly average {{solar radiation}} ranges from 12. 55 MJm. 2 day· 1 in August to 18. 63 MJm. 2 day· 1 in December. In fact only July and August have values less than 15 MJm. 2 day· 1. This is due to the heavy cloud cover {{at the peak of the}} rainy season which prevents sunshine from reaching the earth's surface. However, similar analysis of daily wind speeds at the same location shows an annual mean wind speed of 3. 5 m/s at 1 Om height with peak values of about 4. 9 m/s occurring correspondingly at the peak of the rainy season (July/Aug. - time of lowest solar radiation). This study therefore shows that wind power can properly compliment Photo Voltaic (PV) applications since maximum wind power resources occur at a time corresponding to lowest PV performance resulting from heavy cloud cover. Energy Storage Systems (ESS) in form of Battery Bank accumulator can be used to overcome the well-known variability of wind power by storing energy at periods of high wind speeds which occur, albeit sporadically, but usually at night times when solar energy becomes unavailable. In a pilot scheme, a modem wind turbine with low cut-in speed of 3 m/s was installed at 18 m height at College of Science, Engineering and Technology (SET) Osun State <b>University</b> Osogbo to <b>compliment</b> a 400 Wp Solar Module and a 4. 8 KW-hrs Battery Bank/Inverter system to form a robust and more reliable hybrid alternative power system. This system has been used successfully to support emergency power requirements of college laboratory and office equipment during periods of grid power outages. The study establishes that wind resources of wind power class (WPC) 2 and above can properly compliment small-scale PV systems to overcome lower performance challenges during periods of heavy cloud cover. While available solar radiation and its variation in Osun State and SW Nigeria in general is better known, on the other hand, there is a need to embark on a state-by-state wind resource mapping of the entire country (through long-term measurements of wind speeds with anemometers across the entire country) especially for other areas of greater reliefs which abound in the country and which are expected to have higher wind speed regime potentials than this particular study location. 37...|$|R
