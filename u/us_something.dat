25|$|It's like St. Patrick's Day. I {{came out}} of respect for what my people are doing, not because I believe it will do any good. I thought it would do some good in the beginning. But when the march started to get all the {{official}} approval from Mastah Kennedy, Mastah Wagner, Mastah Spellman, and they started setting limits on how we had to march peacefully, I knew that the march {{was going to be a}} mockery, that they were giving <b>us</b> <b>something</b> again.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the manuscripts {{from the}} Umayyad Dynasty, {{many of the}} early Abbasid manuscripts were copied {{in a number of}} volumes. This is evident from the large scripts used and the smaller number of lines per page. Early Qur'anic manuscripts provide {{evidence}} for the history of the Qur'anic text and their formal features tell <b>us</b> <b>something</b> about the way art and its deeper meaning were perceived in the classical age of Islam. Both its script and layout turned out to be constructed according to elaborate geometrical and proportional rules.|$|E
25|$|An {{analytic}} proposition is true {{by nature}} {{of the meaning of}} the words in the sentence — we require no further knowledge than a grasp of the language to understand this proposition. On the other hand, a synthetic statement is one that tells <b>us</b> <b>something</b> about the world. The truth or falsehood of synthetic statements derives from something outside their linguistic content. In this instance, weight is not a necessary predicate of the body; until we are told the heaviness of the body we do not know that it has weight. In this case, experience of the body is required before its heaviness becomes clear. Before Kant's first Critique, empiricists (cf. Hume) and rationalists (cf. Leibniz) assumed that all synthetic statements required experience to be known.|$|E

500|$|In {{reaction}} {{to the possibility of}} a split in a foreign release, Tarantino stated [...] "Especially if they were dealing with non-English language countries, they don't really have this tradition ... not only do they not really know what a grind house is, they don't even have the double feature tradition. So you are kind of trying to teach <b>us</b> <b>something</b> else." [...] Many European fans saw the split as an attempt to increase profits by forcing audiences to pay twice for what was shown as a single film in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi {{acknowledged}} that Ugo Guerra and Elio Scardamaglia, {{the producers of}} Mario Bava's The Whip and the Body (1963), had [...] "shown me an Italian print of The Pit and the Pendulum before I started writing it: [...] 'Give <b>us</b> <b>something</b> like this', they said." [...] When asked if another of his films, The Long Hair of Death (1964), was inspired by Corman's film, Gastaldi replied, [...] "Yes, of course! The Pit and the Pendulum had a big influence on Italian horror films. [...] Everybody borrowed from it." ...|$|E

Eventually, bassist Joshua Woodard and Westfall recruited drummer Alex Shelnutt only three days before going on tour. Upon being asked, Shelnutt's response was [...] "Ask my mom", as he was 15 at the time. Upon Shelnutt joining, Westfall said the group [...] "started sounding like a real professional band.

[...] Director of exhibitions and collections at the Oceanside Museum of Art, Teri Sowell, reflected of the exhibition featuring Page's work to The San Diego Union-Tribune, [...] "These creatures are so embedded in our minds, we take them for granted. It's really handcrafted art." [...] Film director J. J. Abrams commented on Page's work on his film Super 8, [...] "the designer of the creature, Neville Page, did an amazing job and I think he gave <b>us</b> <b>something</b> that took a ton of iterations but he really nailed it".|$|E
500|$|The {{story and}} {{treatment}} of Gundamma Katha inspired many other Telugu films, resulting in stereotypes in narration. The filmmaker Kadiri Venkata Reddy stated that Gundamma Katha had good dialogue and production design but lacked a proper story to narrate. In her review of screenwriter Trivikram Srinivas' film Attarintiki Daredi (2013), Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu expressed hope that Srinivas [...] "will give <b>us</b> <b>something</b> more innovative than relying on a story that’s been rehashed {{since the time of}} Gundamma Katha". In August 2015, the filmmaker Teja admitted that the Telugu film industry is stuck with two types of narratives and concepts—hero-centric films and those similar to Gundamma Katha. During the promotion of Soukhyam (2015), its director A. S. Ravikumar Chowdary said comedy is a dominant element in Telugu films, citing Gundamma Katha and Aha Naa Pellanta (1987) as examples.|$|E
500|$|... "Everytime" [...] {{was also}} used in the 2013 American film Spring Breakers, {{directed}} by Harmony Korine. The scene begins with the characters of Candy (Vanessa Hudgens), Brittany (Ashley Benson) and Cotty (Rachel Korine) standing in the backyard {{of the character of}} Alien (James Franco), who sits at a white grand piano. The girls are wearing My Little Pony ski masks, sparkly pink tiger bathing suits, sweatpants with [...] "DTF" [...] on the rear and shotguns in their hands. They ask Alien to [...] "Play <b>us</b> <b>something</b> sweet. Something uplifting, Something fucking inspiring," [...] to which he responds [...] "One of the greatest singers of all time, and an angel if there ever was one on this earth", before starting to sing [...] "Everytime". As the song transitions from Alien's vocals to Spears's original version we are shown a montage of the girls and Alien robbing other spring breakers at gunpoint.

500|$|From {{the early}} drafts, Hammerstein and Logan made {{the issue of}} racial {{prejudice}} central to the story. Hammerstein repeatedly rewrote the Act II backstage scene where Emile, Nellie and Cable confront {{the question of the}} Americans' racism. As critic Robert Butler pointed out in his educational companion to the 2001 London production, [...] "if one young person has a prejudice, it might be a character flaw; if two young people share a prejudice, it tells <b>us</b> <b>something</b> about the society in which they grew up". In one draft, Emile advises that the Americans are no better than the Axis Powers, in their prejudice, and suggests they go home to sing songs about how all are created free and equal. [...] Lovensheimer states that a postwar American audience would have found such onstage sentiments to be offensive. In the staged version, Emile's expressions are limited to two lines arguing that prejudice is not inborn.|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN scored {{this season}} an 8.4 out of 10 rating, noting it was [...] "impressive" [...] and that 30 Rock [...] "is {{no longer a}} fresh new series {{and a bit of}} the Season 4 {{doldrums}} could be felt mid season. But the great start and fantastic finish proved that there's still a lot of great comedy to be found on the stages of 30 Rock." [...] Aaron Barnhart of The Kansas City Star deemed the first episode of the season, [...] "Season 4" [...] as [...] "one of the weakest" [...] episodes from 30 Rock that he has ever seen, and found the episode boring. In his review of the third episode, [...] "Stone Mountain", Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club gave it a [...] "C" [...] grade, and not entirely favorable to the first two episodes, Pierce commented that 30 Rock [...] "needs to give <b>us</b> <b>something</b> fast {{to get rid of the}} worst-season-ever stink that's starting to gather." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Beveridge from Mania.com {{praised the}} Cobra the Animation anime series and its visual design, {{comparing}} to The Psychogun ones, {{but said it}} is not for those who are unaware the original series. He said the anime has [...] "a healthy dose of action, the kind of sexuality that's a trademark of the series ... as well as a good bit of silly fun". In the second episode review, Beveridge said it [...] "seems to be following much the same kind of pace and structure" [...] as the OVAs. Its animation was compared with the Darkside Blues; [...] ANN's Erin Finnegan said it was a [...] "gritty" [...] animation, but that from episode five, the animation quality looks more modern and much less gritty. Beveridge said the anime's idea is simple, but added it is [...] "also not a show you see often since it doesn't center around teenagers, schools or the harem concept". He said it is not [...] "a great show", but that [...] "it gives <b>us</b> <b>something</b> different than the usual"the reason it is [...] "enjoyable".|$|E

500|$|Masayoshi Soken {{composed}} {{the majority of}} the game's score—over 100 tracks—in addition to his duties as sound director. The remaining tracks were reused pieces from the original game's soundtrack which was principally composed by Nobuo Uematsu, with assistance from Soken, Tsuyoshi Sekito, and Naoshi Mizuta. Yoshida directed Soken to [...] "give <b>us</b> <b>something</b> straightforward that anyone could identify as Final Fantasy, with an easy-to-understand, expressive orchestral sound". Because of the abbreviated development schedule, Soken focused primarily on creating the soundtrack while his team worked on the various sound effects for the game world. The team was given less than a year on sound production, though according to Soken, it felt like [...] "enough work for two full games in that time". Most of the tracks had specific guidelines or came from the development team's requests, though Soken was allowed to [...] "do what [...] " [...] for Titan's battle theme. Soken sang the vocal work for some tracks, such as the battle theme for Leviathan. Soken also arranged pieces from earlier Final Fantasy games for use in special in-game events.|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment Weiss spoke about Arya's story, saying [...] "Arya is in danger, she's got an open wound in her stomach, and the one person who has protected her to this point unfortunately gets murdered. The fact that the Many-Faced God gets {{the people who have been}} promised to him really makes you think that there's almost an inevitability about what happens to people who run afoul of the Faceless Men, as Arya has done." [...] Weiss continued about the final part of the sequence, [...] "Arya's telling Jaqen by putting the face on the wall that 'this account is settled, and we're good here, and now I'm going to walk away,' and I think she knows what the answer's going to be. The implication, obviously, is that Jaqen was, on some level, rooting for the outcome that he got. He may be [...] "no one," [...] but there's still enough of a person left in him to respect, and admire who this girl is and what she's become. Arya finally tells <b>us</b> <b>something</b> that we've kind of known all along, that she's not no one, she's Arya Stark of Winterfell." ...|$|E
500|$|Subhash K. Jha of the Indo-Asian News Service {{rated the}} film 3 out of 5, calling it [...] "a truly {{outstanding}} film". He said, [...] "Bhandarkar takes us through {{a labyrinth of}} emotions, some devastating in their gut-level directness. But at the end, we come away with a film that gives <b>us</b> <b>something</b> {{to hold on to}} permanently even as the characters on screen lose practically everything worth holding on to". Jha also wrote that the sequences between Chopra and Ranaut as the highlights of the film. Gaurav Malani from The Economic Times rated the film a 3 out of 5, praised Chopra's performance and wrote, [...] "Chopra's character graph [...] skillfully sketched from an aspiring model to an ambitious showstopper to a brash supermodel and subsequently to a faded manikin, desperate to make her comeback. In each phase her character exudes [...] contrasting gamut of emotions". Khalid Mohamed rated Fashion 3 out of 5, called the film a [...] "must-try", and wrote, [...] "Excelling on the catwalk {{as well as in the}} moments of self-destruction, Ranaut’s is the terrific, show-stopping performance". Sonia Chopra of Sify criticised the film's superficial portrayal of the fashion industry and called the film a superficial take on the lives of models and a dumbed-down version of the workings of the fashion industry. However, she praised the performances.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed critical reception. Despite enjoying Tracy's subplot, {{which he}} acknowledges had [...] "a couple of funny moments", Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger wrote that this episode was a [...] "mediocre" [...] one from season four. The A.V. Clubs Leonard Pierce {{noted that this}} episode was not a [...] "terrible" [...] one, though he opined [...] "this is a show that should be giving us more every week than 'wasn't a terrible episode'", and not entirely favorable to [...] "Season Four", [...] "Into the Crevasse", and [...] "Stone Mountain", Pierce commented that 30 Rock [...] "needs to give <b>us</b> <b>something</b> fast {{to get rid of}} the worst-season-ever stink that's starting to gather." [...] In conclusion, he gave it a C grade rating. Time contributor James Poniewozik reported that the [...] "middle America" [...] theme [...] "would have played a little stronger if (1) it wasn't vocalized so blatantly and repeatedly by Liz and Jack and (2) if it hadn't already been the theme of [...] two weeks ago." [...] Meredith Blake, a contributor for the Los Angeles Times, was not complimentary towards [...] "Stone Mountain", citing Jeff Dunham's appearance as the major problem, and concluded by calling the episode [...] "disappointing" [...] and a [...] "letdown". New York magazine contributor Lane Brown also found it unfavorable, calling it a [...] "sorta disappointing episode", and concluded [...] "...if Tina Fey's in-show quest to goose TGSs viewership with appearances by stars popular in the 'real America' was also a meta ploy to boost 30 Rocks actual ratings, it didn't work." ...|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Derbyshire, culture {{editor of}} the New Statesman called it [...] "a {{remarkable}} novel" [...] and its protagonist [...] "a convincing witness to the defining moral catastrophe of the 20th century." [...] Tim Martin of The Telegraph praised the novel for not being just another story about banality of evil: [...] "it is a magnificently artificial project in character construction, a highly literary and provocative {{attempt to create a}} character various enough to match the many discontinuous realities of the apocalyptic Nazi world-view. The result is a sprawling, daring, loose-ended monster of a book, one that justifies its towering subject matter by its persistent and troubling refusal to offer easy answers and to make satisfying sense." [...] Writing for The Guardian, British author James Lasdun criticized the novel for [...] "some large flaws" [...] such as its main character, [...] "a ghoul belonging more to the fictional universe of, say, Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho", and provocative use of anachronisms, but called it a [...] "monumental inquiry into evil. To say that it falls short of Melville's visionary originality (and lacks, also, the breadth and vitality of Tolstoy, despite the claims of some reviewers) is hardly a criticism. It's a rare book that even invites such comparisons, and for all its faults, for all its problematic use of history, The Kindly Ones does just that." [...] In The Spectator, British journalist and biographer Patrick Marnham wrote: [...] "Dr Aue cannot be brought to trial because he does not exist; on the other hand, he can give <b>us</b> <b>something</b> even more valuable than vengeance, something that no real war criminal can manage, and that is total honesty." [...] Harvard University's English studies' Professor Leland de la Durantaye wrote that The Kindly Ones [...] "is indeed about cruelty and evil in the way that morality plays are, but it is also about evil in history, the weaving together of hundreds of objectives, millions of people, into an ensemble so vast, diverse, and ever-changing that even a well-placed and sharp-sighted observer cannot fully grasp it." ...|$|E
