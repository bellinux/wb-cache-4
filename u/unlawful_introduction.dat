The dominant role of Cumberland sliders on the market resulted in cases of their <b>unlawful</b> <b>introduction</b> into the environment and the appearance of free-living individuals in Poland. The conclusions of the study point to the significance of economic mechanisms in preventing the dispersal of invasive species...|$|E
