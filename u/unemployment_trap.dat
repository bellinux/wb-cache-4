In the period 1982 - 2000 employment outcomes among public housing tenants has deteriorated, despite an improving employment outlook for the general working age population during most of the 1990 s. In this paper, we report the findings from the first stage of a collaborative research venture that examines the impacts of housing assistance, that is public housing concessional rents and Commonwealth Rent Assistance, on economic participation outcomes. Research directions that will be followed in the remainder of the collaborative research venture are also outlined in this paper. The first stage of the collaborative research venture comprises four main components. Firstly, housing assistance recipients are profiled against appropriate benchmark groups in the Australian population. Secondly, the contribution of housing assistance programmes to poverty and <b>unemployment</b> <b>traps</b> are measured. Thirdly, data sources that will enable researchers to conduct analysis into the causal links between housing assistance and economic participation are examined. Fourthly, an inventory of housing policy initiatives that encourage economic participation is provided.

In order to assess them, we use panel data sample selection models. Specifically, we estimate a parametric random effects models composed by a wage equation and a selection equation by maximum likelihood techniques. The income ratios have been computed for every individual in the sample by using the predicted wages obtained from the estimation of the wage equation corrected for sample selectivity. The empirical analyses has exploited the data extracted from the waves 1993 - 1997 of the Panel Study of Belgian Household and has been led separately on (unbalanced) samples of men and women. The estimation results suggest {{significant differences in the}} behaviour of these two groups. The experience of long periods of unemployment in the past is particularly important: long-term unemployed people have difficulties in re-integrating the labour market and they obtain low salaries when they succeed in finding employment. Long unemployment spells are likely to have a ?scarring? effect on subsequent earnings. Moreover, the computation of income ratios for all individuals highlights the importance of <b>unemployment</b> <b>traps</b> for the women present in the sample.

50|$|The {{welfare trap}} (or <b>unemployment</b> <b>trap</b> or poverty trap in British English) theory asserts that {{taxation}} and welfare systems can jointly contribute {{to keep people}} on social insurance because the withdrawal of means tested benefits that comes with entering low-paid work causes there to be no significant increase in total income. An individual sees that the opportunity cost of returning to work is too great for too little a financial return, and this can create a perverse incentive to not work.|$|E
5000|$|There is an {{association}} between a parent's welfare dependency and that of her children; a mother's welfare participation {{increases the likelihood that}} her daughter, when grown, will also be dependent on welfare. The mechanisms through which this happens may include the child's lessened feelings of stigma related to being on welfare, lack of job opportunities because he or she did not observe a parent's participation in the labor market, and detailed knowledge of how the welfare system works imprinted from a young age. [...] In some cases, the <b>unemployment</b> <b>trap</b> may function as a perverse incentive to remain dependent on welfare payments, as returning to work would not significantly increase household earnings as welfare benefits are withdrawn, and the associated costs and stressors would outweigh any benefits. This trap can be eliminated through the addition of work subsidies.|$|E

Some selected aspects of four types of unintended effects are discussed in this article. First, effects due to redistribution of income as well as life chances and opportunities as determined by market forces and attitudes (sexism, ageism, racism) favor some at the expense of others. Even redistribution which increases gross domestic product (GDP) often disadvantages certain groups. Second, contingency-related benefits tend to favor population groups differently. Third, free and subsidized health services, in certain conditions, increase both the supply and demand for services-the moral hazard problem.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the importance}} of financial dis-incentives for workers in Denmark. Based on a panel survey which is merged {{to a number of}} administrative registers it is possible to calculate precise measures of the economic incentives for labour force participants between employment in a full time job and being on unemployment insurance benefits and considering also the fixed costs of work. The results indicate large dis-incentives effects for groups, especially low paid women. In 1996, 6 per cent of Danish men and 13 per cent of the women had a lower disposable net income if working a full-time job compared to being on unemployment benefits. The effect of these financial dis-incentives is analysed in simple reduced form models of on-the-job search, unemployment search behaviour, unemployment risk, and transition out of the labour force. We find that the net compensation rate in unemployment has a significant impact on women's propensity to leave the labour force, on measures of search intensity, on the risk of being hit by unemployment and on one of our flexibility measures, i. e. the maximum acceptable commuting time to a job. The net compensation rate has no impact on the willingness to move to another place to get a job. However, here we find a significant impact from job attitude related measures. We end the paper reporting the results from including attitude variables along with economic variables. We find a number of significant effects from attitude variables.

In {{the first part}} several versions of a microfounded dynamic general equilibrium model with monopolistic competitors in the product and/or labor market are derived and simulated. First of all, the monetary persistence of a pure price staggering economy is compared to a pure wage staggering economy under different labor market structures (by means of a newly proposed persistence measure) and interactions are explored. Secondly, the thesis simulates the effects of real wage rigidities in a disinflation experiment non-linearly. Thereby, caveats of the conventionally used log-linearization are shown. The {{second part of the}} thesis develops a dynamic microfounded labor market framework with insider wage bargaining, labor turnovers costs and tax distortions. The calibrated model is used in order to analyze different labor market policies.

40|$|This paper aims to {{identify}} {{the contribution of the}} business cycle and structural factors to the development of part-time employment in the EU- 15 countries, through the exploitation of both cross-sectional and time series variations over the past two decades. Key results include that the business cycle is found to exert a negative effect on part-time employment developments. This is consistent with firms utilising part-time employment as a means of adjusting their labour force to economic conditions. Correspondingly, involuntary part-time employment is found to be countercyclical, being higher in troughs of economic activity. Splitting our sample reveals a very significant effect of the business cycle on the rate of part-time work for young and male prime-age workers. Conversely, the effect is very weak for women and insignificant for older workers. Institutions and other structural factors are also found to be significant and important determinants of the rate of part-time employment. Changes in legislation to part-time employment are found to be effective, having a strong and positive impact on part-time employment developments. Moreover, employment protection legislation is positively correlated with the part-time employment rate, which is consistent with the use of part-time work as a tool for enhancing flexibility in the presence of rigid labour markets. Less robust evidence suggests the presence of <b>unemployment</b> <b>traps</b> for some potential part-time workers. Cross-country evidence also indicates that the lower labour costs borne by firms when employing part-time workers has a large and positive influence on the part-time employment rate...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we build}} a renewed labour supply model {{in order to}} explain why the RMI {{recipients}} don't «fall in poverty traps» but on the contrary accept to work even for low wages. The standard consumption-leisure trade-off is extended : we consider that one needs a minimum consumption level that the non-working time can be either leisure time or to idle time. In the standard labour supply model, leisure which enters in the utility function is implicitly defined as the non-working time. This is regrettable since this period of time is not entirely dedicated to pleasant activities. One can «do nothing» : this «non activity» can be modelled as an inferior good. In this "consumption-leisure-idle time" trade-off, labour supply depends on how much the worker can consume over the survival level and on what he does during non-working time. RMI recipients' consumption is close to the survival level and they have not much to spend on leisure : labour supply is inelastic to wage and there are no <b>traps.</b> <b>Unemployment</b> and poverty <b>traps,</b> consumption/leisure trade-off, RMI. ...|$|R

As a result, counter-cyclical macroeconomic policy is diminished, and policy makers are led to focus on policies of labor market flexibility. This policy stance results in permanently higher aggregate unemployment, and promotes the remaking of labor markets in a fashion that increases worker economic insecurity and lowers wages. Moreover, to the extent that monetary authorities adopt a pre-emptive approach to inflation, they risk making high structural unemployment self-fulfilling.
