5|$|In its 2014 {{edition of}} the Technology Roadmap: Solar Photovoltaic Energy report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) {{published}} prices for residential, commercial and utility-scale PV systems for eight major markets as of 2013 (see table below). However, DOE's SunShot Initiative has reported much lower U.S. installation prices. In 2014, prices continued to decline. The SunShot Initiative modeled U.S. system prices {{to be in the}} range of $1.80 to $3.29 per watt. Other sources identify similar price ranges of $1.70 to $3.50 for the different market segments in the U.S., and in the highly penetrated German market, prices for residential and small commercial rooftop systems of up to 100kW declined to $1.36 per watt (€1.24/W) by the end of 2014. In 2015, Deutsche Bank estimated costs for small residential rooftop systems in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>around</b> $2.90 per watt. Costs for utility-scale systems in China and India were estimated as low as $1.00 per watt.|$|E

500|$|Originally {{located at}} 79 Washington Street in Brooklyn, New York, Amperex was a {{long-established}} manufacturer of transmitting tubes {{when they were}} acquired by the Dutch firm, Philips, (known more widely as Norelco in the <b>US),</b> <b>around</b> 1955. Philips continued to improve and enlarge the [...] tube plant in New York, but also used the Amperex name to distribute their new line of Dutch-made miniature tubes, (12AX7, 12AU7, 12AT7) to feed the booming U.S. hi-fi market. Classic hi-fi brands such as Marantz, Fisher, and H. H. Scott, Inc., used these tubes. Amperex also produced the 6DJ8, 6922 and 7308 frame grid tubes. Developed by Amperex in 1958 when transistors were beginning to supplant tubes and originally developed for video and radar use, the 6DJ8 also excelled in audio amplifiers needing its high transconductance, and it still has a niche market among audiophiles.|$|E

500|$|Most significant, from Phillips' own {{point of}} view, is her exposé of the [...] "Boys' Club" [...] {{in the higher}} echelons of Hollywood, where she claimed it was her gender that led to her {{ultimate}} ostracism. [...] "If I had been a man, they would have closed ranks around me", she said, referring to her drug addiction. [...] "They hated the woman thing. And I wasn't even regarded as a woman, I was a girl." [...] Writing about her in The Independent in 2002, film critic David Thomson expressed Phillips' attitude as: [...] "you [...] guys don't take women seriously; you like <b>us</b> <b>around...</b> we aren't allowed to be players". Those same few men, like [...] "Valley viper" [...] Mike Ovitz who headed the Creative Artists Agency were, in her eyes, responsible for a qualitative decline in standards and the increasing banality of movies since the 1970s.|$|E

On the tour with Disturbed, Chevelle appeared on the tour compilation album, titled Music as a Weapon II, featuring the songs [...] "The Red" [...] and [...] "Forfeit".
