40|$|When sown {{correctly}} at {{the right}} time, in the right position within the rotation, cover crops retain nutrients, conserve water, prevent soil erosion, improve soil fertility and quality, and suppress weeds. Growing cover crops is recognized as a climate-smart agricultural practice. Practical recommendation Where to position and when to time cover crops in the rotation? •	Grow cover crops in the 1 st and 2 nd year after ploughing of clover-grass to avoid nitrogen losses. •	Grow nitrogen fixing cover crops on soils with low fertility. •	Sow cover crops into or immediately after the main crop. In row crops, sow the cover crop {{in combination with the}} last hoeing. If the harvest of the main crop is rather early, sow the cover crop after harvest. •	The earlier a cover crop is sown in August, less nitrogen is lost. Each day of delay in sowing a cruciferous cover crop in August results in loss of about 2 kg of N per ha. •	Do not sow cruciferous cover crops into main crops shortly before the harvest, as weed competition may be too high for successful establishment of the cover crop. •	Cover crops sown in spring usually establish well and safely. For spring-sown cover crops use clover mix rather than ryegrass to satisfy nitrogen needs. •	On sandy soils with irrigation, <b>undersow</b> spring crops with wide row distances after the main crop has developed 1 - 2 nodes high to allow hoeing of the main crop in early stages. •	In winter crops, sow cover crops (clover mix rather than ryegrass) in spring as early as possible. •	Use cover crops after application of large amounts of solid manure, as it helps to retain the nitrogen. •	In lupines or broad beans, <b>undersow</b> a cover crop followed by a spring crop the next year. If a winter crop is chosen instead, perennial weeds might flourish. Cover crops and weed control •	Problems with creeping thistle, sow-thistle and coltsfoot do not rule out cover crops: Sow the cover crop immedia¬tely after an early harvest and ploughing. Repeat ploughing in spring before sowing a spring crop. •	To reduce couch-grass, mechanical treatment in autumn is more efficient than growing a cover crop...|$|E

An undersown crop, which grows together with a main crop and post-harvest, could address such disadvantages. The aim {{of this study was to}} gain knowledge needed to develop <b>undersowing</b> for Finnish conditions in the interests of optimizing cereal production and meeting environmental goals. Studies were made on the effects of undersown species and management practices on biomass and N yield of undersown crops, grain yield of spring cereals and soil nitrate levels. In total, 17 plant species were undersown in spring cereals during the field experiments carried out between 1991 and 1999 at four sites in south and central Finland. After analysis of preliminary results, eight species were studied more thoroughly. Two legumes, one grass species and one grass-legume mixture were included in long-term trials in order to study annually repeated <b>undersowing.</b> Simultaneous broadcasting of seeds instead of specific <b>undersowing</b> was also studied. Moreover, seeding rates of undersown crops and N fertilization application rates during annually repeated <b>undersowing</b> were researched. Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam., IR) absorbed soil nitrate N (NO 3 -N) most efficiently in autumn and timothy (Phleum pratense L.) in spring. The capacity of other grass species to take-up N was low, or it was insufficient considering its negative effect on grain yield. Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) were well suited to annually repeated <b>undersowing,</b> supplying fixed N for cereals without markedly increasing the risk of N leaching. Autumn oriented growth rhythms of the studied legumes were optimal for <b>undersowing,</b> whereas those of grasses were less well suited despite variation in the trait among species. All species were compared according several critical features required of an <b>undersowing</b> system. A model of an adaptive <b>undersowing</b> system was outlined in order to emphasize allocation of measures according to needs. After defining the goal of <b>undersowing,</b> many decisions need to be made. When the primary consideration is reduction in N leaching, a mixture of IR and timothy is advantageous. Clovers represent suitable replacements for N fertilization because their positive residual effect is greater than the negative effect of increased competition. A mixture of legume and nonlegume is a good choice when increased plant diversity is the main target. Seeding rate is an efficient means for adjusting the levels of competition and N effects.

40|$|There is a {{shortage}} of organic grains, and a need to develop organic production systems which ensure high and stable grain yields. Commercial organic grain production is mainly a task for farms with few or no livestock, and the development of well functioning strategies for nutrient supply and weed control in commercial organic cereal production under such conditions, is a considerable scientific challenge. The nutrient losses should be minimized and grain yields maintained at economically satisfactory levels over time. A promising strategy involves <b>undersowing</b> of clover in grains where yields can be taken and nitrogen (N) be supplied simultaneously. The main objective of this project was to evaluate if repeated <b>undersowing</b> of clover is a well functioning green manuring strategy to obtain high and stable cereal yield on stockless organic farms. Further goals were to quantify effects of repeated <b>undersowing</b> of clover on grain yields and: 1) Field N balance, 2) Mobilization of soil mineral phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) and 3) Weed infestation. Two systems for N supply to organic spring grains were compared at Bioforsk Arable Crop Division, Apelsvoll and Kise in central south east Norway. Both systems consisted of cover crops which are grown {{for the benefit of the}} soil and/or other plants. Repeated <b>undersowing</b> of clover in the grains in four consecutive growing seasons (2002 – 2005) was compared to a treatment with whole-season green manure in the second year. The residual effect of all treatments was measured in 2006. The use of legumes, undersown in grains as well as used as a whole-season green manure, significantly increased the subsequent grain yield in an organic production system with no other fertilizers applied. The average grain yield over four years was larger with continuous <b>undersowing</b> than with a whole season green manure in the second year of the period. Hence, in organic stockless grain production systems it seems to be a better option to harvest cereals each year with undersown legumes, than to use a whole growing season each fourth year to produce nutrients for subsequent grains. However, when legumes are included in most years of the crop rotation, there is a risk that plant health problems may arise, such as nematodes or fungi. No beneficial effects of repeated clover <b>undersowing</b> was recorded with regard to control of annual weeds. However, the expected competitive effect of the <b>undersowing</b> on the weeds may have been obscured by an increased N supply from the undersown clover. Not only the grain plants, but also the weeds responded with increased growth when clover was grown in the previous season.

The biomass of the catch crop was markedly reduced with delayed <b>undersowing,</b> but net biomass production in late autumn was generally not affected. On light soil the barley yield was only to a small extent affected by the undersown catch crop, and with delayed <b>undersowing</b> the yield was even less affected. On heavier soil the barley yield was only marginally affected regardless of time of catch crop <b>undersowing.</b> An alternative to the <b>undersowing</b> of catch crops would be relay cropping of two cereal crops, one spring crop and one winter crop. As their initial competitive capacities are similar there is a risk that the winter crop will affect the spring crop yield adversely. To be able to set the competitive relationship between the crops favourably for the relay cropping system to be effective, a means to delay the winter crop germination is needed. Delayed <b>undersowing</b> has the risk of damaging the spring crop by the drilling procedur itself, and this was also noticed in the catch crop field experiments. In a couple of experiments the technique of coating seeds with polymers to achieve delayed germination was explored. The materials used were cellulose lacquer (in one experiment with the addition of lanolin) or an acrylic plastic, a so called primer. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and oil seed rape (Brassica napus L.) were coated in house with several coating levels and germinated under controlled conditions in Petri dishes. In one experiment the coated seeds were germinated under three different temperature levels and three different moisture levels. It was found that delays could be achieved and that with increasing coating level the delays increased. It was also found that at low germination temperature (5. 5 °C) for plastic coated seeds there was almost no difference in temperature sum needed from sowing to germination regardless of coating level. At high germination temperature (13. 9 °C) there was a marked increase in temperature sum needed to germination and it increased with increasing coating level in comparison with uncoated seed. The resulting germination pattern was hypothetically explained by the dependence of water and oxygen uptake on temperature, in relation to the permeability of the coating materials. The permeability of the materials was probably rather constant over the temperature range. To gain the necessary control of the desired germination delay further investigations are needed, in collaboration with other scientific disciplines...|$|R

Various implements were coupled behind the combined drill in cases where seed was broadcast: a press-wheel attachment, a long-tined harrow and a cage roller. A fourth treatment did not include an implement coupled behind the drill. The undersown crop was sown as a seed mixture of 3 kg ha- 1 red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and 6 kg ha- 1 meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Hudson). The numbers of plants and weeds and the plant height were measured five times during the growing season. Above-ground biomass of the undersown species was determined at barley harvest and in late autumn. Grain yield of spring barley was recorded. Drilling resulted in the highest yield of undersown crop when an early summer drought occurred, but broadcasting in combination with use of seed covering equipment led to the least variation in biomass production over the 4 years the experiment was conducted. The relative proportion of meadow fescue in the crop was low in three years, and lower when broadcast than when drilled.

Florilega responded similarly to D. radicum in 2003, but in 2004 the opposite was true. This is the first study to demonstrate that relay cropping can reduce egg-laying by D. radicum while minimizing competition between component crops for key resources. [...] Comparison of oviposition data from the 1950 s to data from the diversification studies indicate that D. platura ID. florilega eggs were more prevalent than D. radicum in 2003 - 04 than fifty years earlier.

40|$|A journal {{article on}} the effect of <b>undersowing</b> Euca!yptus with maize and cow-peas on tree growth and crop {{performance}} in Zimbabwe's agricultural sector [...] Maize (Zea mays L.) hybrid R 201 and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) variety IT 82 D- 875 were separately inter-row interplanted with gum-tree (Eucalyptus camaldulensis L.) during the 1995 - 96 cropping season at Domboshava Training Centre. Planting E. camaldulensis with cowpeas and maize had no marked effect on the yields of the two annual crops. Sole clean-weeded E. camaldulensis had significantly thicker circumference than the Eucalyptus in the other treatments, but was comparable to Eucalyptus interplanted with the annual crops in terms of branching habit. However, E. camaldulensis interplanted with maize showed a slightly higher performance (branching and circumference) than that interplanted with cowpeas. This was probably related to the fertilizer added to the maize/£. camaldulensis intercrop since no fertilizer was added to the cowpea/£. camaldulensis intercrop. Management factors such as clean weeding in sole Eucalyptus markedly increased tree performance as observed through parameters of stem circumference and branching compared to those of the unweeded sole Eucalyptus situation. Neither tree branching pattern, height growth nor soil moisture were significantly affected by intercropping with annual crops. <b>Undersowing</b> annual crops to E. camaldulensis will facilitate maximum utilization of land and light {{in the early years of}} E. camaldulensis woodlot establishment. This approach will also allow better tree growth when compared to the unweeded situation which is common in small-holder farming...|$|R

40|$|Agriculture {{is facing}} {{increasing}} pressures to produce food that meets specific market and/or nutrition requirements, while using inputs {{in such a}} way that can ensure economic and environmental goals more efficiently. Two field experiments were conducted in 2013 and 2014 at the Royal Agricultural University’s Harnhill’ Manor Farm, Cirencester, UK to evaluate the influence of selected cultivation techniques, N fertilisation and <b>undersowing</b> legumes on spring wheat growth and development. To explore, in particular, the yield components contributing to grain yield and quality, as well as weed pressure influences together with changes in soil mineral N (SMN) content. Cultivation techniques included conventional tillage (CT), high intensity non-inversion tillage (HINiT) and low intensity non-inversion tillage (LINiT); mineral N fertilisation rates of 0, 70, 140 and 210 kg N ha- 1 and two undersown legume species, black medic and white clover, plus no <b>undersowing</b> treatment. The performance of the management practices was strongly influenced by the weather. In 2013, under dry weather conditions, LINiT seems to be a suitable alternative to CT, while N fertilisation did not encourage greater grain yield. In 2014, CT appears to be a more reliable practice, while the application of up to 140 kg N ha- 1 seemed to be enough to increase grain yield. Dry weather conditions at the time of broadcasting did not allow the <b>undersowing</b> species to be fully established, resulting in no effects on weed control and crop growth. In 2013, the initial poor plant establishment and slow crop growth under LINiT was compensated for by the soils ability to retain moisture, and thereby reducing crop water stress during the dry periods. This finally resulted in statistically similar grain yield to CT. In 2014 when water was not a limiting factor, poor plant establishment and crop growth, low SMN content and high weed pressure under LINiT resulted in lower grain yield than CT. In both years, HINiT resulted in low SMN content and high weed pressure resulting in poor grain yield. Across experiments, HINiT and LINiT saved energy-use and production costs, but CT could be more energy-use efficient and have high economic return if higher grain yield is assured. N fertilisation significantly promoted wheat growth, although under dry conditions with higher residual soil N, the N fertilisation did not increase yield. Under low SMN level applying up to 140 kg N ha- 1 increased grain yield produced, but N fertilisation is energy consuming and its use does not always ensure a higher economic return...|$|R
40|$|The {{rotation}} of crops with planted, N 2 -fixing legumes is a promising agroforestry innovation for replenishing soil fertility in the tropics. We postulated that woody and herbaceous legumes with different growth and rooting patterns could be mixed to optimize above- and belowground resource capture. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of species interactions on resource utilization by legumes grown in mixtures on a Kandiudalfic Eutrudox in western Kenya. Four woody legume shrubs—pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. ], sesbania [Sesbania sesban (L.) Merr. ], crotalaria (Crotalaria grahamiana Wight and Arn.), and tephrosia (Tephrosia vogelii Hook F.) —grown in monoculture and mixed stands were evaluated for light interception, soil N and water uptake, and biomass production. Siratro [Macroptilium atropurpureum (DC.) Urb. ] and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) were undersown in woody legume stands. Total aboveground biomass production ranged from 9 to 13 Mg ha- 1 for monoculture and 8 to 15 Mg ha- 1 for mixtures of woody legumes. Total N in woody-legume stands ranged from 100 to 178 kg N ha- 1. Biomass and plant N were not significantly different among woody-legume treatments. However, <b>undersowing</b> siratro as a supplement increased stand productivity and recycled biomass N. Species complementarity in topsoil and subsoil utilization of mineral N was observed in crotalaria sesbania and pigeonpea tephrosia mixed stands. Dense soil cover created by siratro led to better conservation of soil water. Results indicated that the tested mixtures provide a better risk management strategy through compensatory growth potential. Greatest opportunities for intensifying resource utilization appear to exist through <b>undersowing</b> a creeping legume with an open-canopy woody legume...|$|R

Here we demonstrate that including species-rich legume-based leys in the rotation helps to maximize synergies between agricultural productivity and other ecosystem services. By using functionally diverse plant species mixtures these services can be optimised and fine-tuned to regional and farm-specific needs. Field experiments run over three years at multiple locations showed that the stability of ley performance was greater in multi-species mixtures than in legume monocultures. In addition, mixing different legume species in the ley helps to suppress both early and late weeds. Further, combining complementary phenologies of different legume species extended forage availability for key pollinator species. Finally, widening the range of legume species increases opportunities to build short term leys into rotations on conventional farms via cover cropping or <b>undersowing...</b>|$|R
