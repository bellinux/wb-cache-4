40|$|From an {{examination}} of the agreements and differences between different satellite instruments, it is difficult to believe that existing satellite instruments determine upper stratospheric ozone much better than 4 pct.; by extension, it probably would require at least a 4 pct. change to be reliably detected as a change. The best estimates of the vertical profiles of ozone change in the upper stratosphere between 1979 and 1986 are judged to be those given by the two SAGE satellite instruments. SAGE- 2 minus SAGE- 1 gives a much lower ozone reduction than that given by the archived Solar Backscatter UV data. The average SAGE profiles of ozone changes between 20 and 50 degs north and between 20 and 50 degs south are given. The SAGE- 1 and SAGE- 2 comparison gives an ozone reduction of about 4 pct. at 25 km over temperate latitudes. Five ground based Umkehr stations between 36 and 52 degs north, corrected for the effects of volcanic aerosols, report an ozone reduction between 1979 and 1987 at <b>Umkehr</b> <b>layer</b> 8 of 9 + or - 5 pct. The central estimate of upper stratospheric ozone reduction given by SAGE at 40 km is less than the central value estimated by the Umkehr method at layer 8...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{modeling}} of altitude-dependent patterns of ozone variations over time. Umkher ozone profiles (quarter of <b>Umkehr</b> <b>layer)</b> from 1978 to 2011 are investigated at two locations: Boulder (USA) and Arosa (Switzerland). The study consists of two statistical stages. First we approximate ozone profiles employing an appropriate basis. To capture primary modes of ozone variations without losing essential information, a functional principal component analysis is performed as it penalizes roughness of the function and smooths excessive variations {{in the shape of the}} ozone profiles. As a result, data driven basis functions are obtained. Secondly we estimate the effects of covariates – month, year (trend), quasi biennial oscillation, the Solar cycle, arctic oscillation and the El Niño/Southern Oscillation cycle – on the principal component scores of ozone profiles over time using generalized additive models. The effects are smooth functions of the covariates, and are represented by knot-based regression cubic splines. Finally we employ generalized additive mixed effects models incorporating a more complex error structure that reflects the observed seasonality in the data. The analysis provides more accurate estimates of influences and trends, together with enhanced uncertainty quantification. We are able to capture fine variations in the time evolution of the profiles such as the semi-annual oscillation. We conclude by showing the trends by altitude over Boulder. The strongly declining trends over 2003 – 2011 for altitudes of 32 – 64 hPa show that stratospheric ozone is not yet fully recovering...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} stratospheric {{aerosols}} on Umkehr estimates of long-term ozone depletion associated with chlorofluoromethanes (CFMs) is considered in a statistical time series trend analysis. Time series models are estimated using monthly averages of Umkehr measurements {{made over the}} last 15 to 20 years. The time series regression models incorporate seasonal, trend and noise factors and an additional factor {{to account for the}} effects of atmospheric aerosols on the Umkehr measurements. The analysis indicates a statistically significant relation with atmospheric aerosol transmission in the <b>Umkehr</b> <b>layers</b> and implies that the relation {{is an important factor in}} any time series trend analysis of Umkehr data. Taking this relation into account, statistically significant negative trends were found in the Upper <b>Umkehr</b> <b>layers.</b> It is pointed out that upper stratospheric ozone could be sensitive to long-term solar variability as well as other possible influences in addition to CFM-induced effects, and therefore the cause or causes of the estimated trend cannot be unambiguously estimated using current Umkehr data...|$|R
40|$|The {{time series}} of {{differences}} in coincident measurements of ozone by Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) and by Solar Backscattered Ultraviolet (SBUV), SBUV/ 2, Umkehr and Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) are analyzed, and the slopes in the differences are calculated. SAGE ozone measurements are also compared against those by HALOE. The purpose of these comparisons {{is to look for}} statistically significant nonzero slopes which could indicate long-term calibration problems in {{one or more of the}} measurement systems. It is found that the slopes are remarkably similar between the Northern and Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes, and, apart from a few exceptions, the slopes are also similar in the tropics. Slopes of MLS-SAGE differences and HALOE-SAGE trends from approximately 1992 to 1996 have values of approximately - 0. 5 +/- 0. 4 %/yr (95 % confidence limits) in <b>Umkehr</b> <b>layers</b> 7 - 9 (which are centered at approx. 37, 42, and 47 km altitude). Umkehr-SAGE slopes for 1979 - 1996, however, are almost all positive and in the range - 0. 1 - 0. 41 %/yr for <b>Umkehr</b> <b>layers</b> 4 - 8, while SBUV-SAGE slopes for 1979 - 1989 are essentially zero in layers 4 - 7 and 0. 3 - 0. 4 %/yr in layers 8 and 9. Averaging all these results with SBUV-SAGE 11 slopes from 1985 to 1989, the other sensors minus SAGE slopes are most likely between 0. 2 and - 0. 2 %/yr 1 from approx. 20 to 40 km altitude. The results indicate slightly negative slopes in <b>Umkehr</b> <b>layers</b> 5 - 7 and positive slopes in the other three layers. There thus appears to be no overall drift in the SAGE ozone measurements from 1979 to 1996, but SAGE sunrise/sunset trend differences greater than 40 km altitude, combined with the more accurate SBUV-SAGE slopes for 1979 - 1989, suggest a most likely slope range of 0. 4 to - 0. 4 %/yr between 40 and 50 km altitude. SBUV/ 2 measurements from 1989 to 1994 have an upward trend with respect to SAGE measurements of approx. 0. 7 % /yr with some altitudinal structure; this slope exceeds the estimated 95 % uncertainties on the SBUV/ 2 trends...|$|R
40|$|An {{inversion}} {{algorithm is}} presented, {{which is used}} to process Nimbus- 7 solar backscattered UV (SBUV) data collected between November 1978 and October 1980. The SBUV experiment utilizes a double monochromator in the nadir position which measures the backscattered solar radiation in twelve 1 -nm bands; a separate photometer measures the radiance at 343. 0 nm in the field of view coincident with the monochromator. The primary output of the inversion is the total ozone content in <b>umkehr</b> <b>layers</b> in units of m atm cm. In addition, the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix are reported; they represent the uncertainty in the derived ozone content in each layer. The solution covariance is noted to be independent of the measurements...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} and applies a {{new technique}} for retrieving diurnal variability in tropospheric ozone vertical distribution using ground-based measurements of ultraviolet sky radiances. The measured radiances are obtained by a polarization-insensitive modified Brewer double spectrometer located at Goddard Space Flight Center, in Greenbelt, Maryland, USA. Results demonstrate that the Brewer angular (0 - 72 deg viewing zenith angle) and spectral (303 - 320 nm) measurements of sky radiance in the solar principal plane provide sufficient information to derive tropospheric ozone diurnal variability. In addition, the Brewer measurements provide stratospheric ozone vertical distributions at least twice per day near sunrise and sunset. Frequent measurements of total column ozone amounts from direct-sun observations are used as constraints in the retrieval. The vertical ozone profile resolution is shown in terms of averaging kernels to yield at least four points in the troposphere-low stratosphere, including good information in <b>Umkehr</b> <b>layer</b> 0 (0 - 5 km). The focus {{of this paper is}} on the derivation of stratospheric and tropospheric ozone profiles using both simulated and measured radiances. We briefly discuss the necessary modifications of the Brewer spectrometer that were used to eliminate instrumental polarization sensitivity so that accurate sky radiances can be obtained in the presence of strong Rayleigh scattering and aerosols. The results demonstrate that including a site-specific and time-dependent aerosol correction, based on Brewer direct-sun observations of aerosol optical thickness, is critical to minimize the sky radiance residuals as a function of observing angle in the optimal estimation inversion algorithm and improve the accuracy of the retrieved ozone profile...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} 1211 cases of coincident ozone profiles derived from 1164 Umkehrs and 928 Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II (SAGE II) profiles within 1000 km and 12 hours between October 1984 and April 1989 {{to study the}} stratospheric-aerosol effect on Umkehr ozone profiles. Because of the close correspondence of stratospheric aerosol optical depth at the SAGE II-measured 0. 525 -micrometer wavelength and the extrapolated 0. 32 Umkehr wavelength determined {{in this study we}} use the 0. 525 -micrometer data to determine the aerosol effect on Umkehr profiles. At the 95 % confidence level, we find the following errors to the Umkehr ozone amounts: in <b>Umkehr</b> <b>layer</b> 9 (- 2. 9 +/- 2. 1), layer 8 (- 2. 3 +/- 1. 1), layer 7 (0. 1 +/- 1. 1), layer 6 (2. 2 +/- 1. 0), layer 5 (- 1. 5 +/- 0. 8), and layer 4 (- 2. 4 +/- 1. 7) in percent ozone amount per 0. 01 stratospheric aerosol optical depth. These results agree with previous theoretical and empirical studies within their respective error bounds in layers 9, 8, and 7. The results in layers 6, 5, and 4 differ significantly from those in previous works. Using only those eight stations with more than 47 coincidences results in mean aerosol effects that are not significantly different from the 14 -station results. Because SAGE II and Umkehr produce different ozone retrievals in layer 9 and because the intralayer correlation of SAGE II ozone and aerosol in layer 9 is nonzero, one must exercise some caution in attributing the entire SAGE II-Umkehr difference in this layer to an aerosol effect...|$|E
40|$|A {{statistical}} analysis of zonal monthly average ozone from solar backscatter ultraviolet in 10 ° latitude bands over 20 °S– 20 °N for the period November 1978 to December 2008 is performed to find heightwise trend in the tropical stratosphere. A turning point (TP) of January 1999 is found for tropics, whereas a TP of January 1997, attributed to the change in equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine (EESC), was found for midlatitudes in previous studies. The introduction of two more TPs corresponding to the beginning and ending {{of the effect of}} Mt. Pinatubo volcanic eruption improves the representation of observed behavior of ozone in the lower (20 – 30 km) and in the upper (> 30 km) stratospheres. The trend in total stratospheric ozone column is small compared to those in lower and upper stratospheric ozone columns during the considered subperiods created by TPs. The values of piecewise trend in the lower and upper stratospheres during the periods 1994 – 1999 and 1999 – 2008 are significant. The directions of trend (downward/upward) in the upper and lower stratospheres are opposite, and more conspicuously after January 1999 when the trend in the lower stratosphere decreased in contrast to an increase in the upper stratosphere. The trend at <b>Umkehr</b> <b>layer</b> 5 is almost zero at all times during the period 1978 – 2008. The timewise variation in the trend is comparatively large between Umkehr layers 2 – 3 and 7 – 10. The Eliassen-Palm-flux gives negative contribution to ozone in the lower stratosphere and positive contribution in the upper stratosphere, indicating that ozone is affected by transport over tropics...|$|E
40|$|The Umkehr {{method for}} {{retrieving}} the gross {{features of the}} vertical ozone distribution requires measurements of the ratio of zenith-sky radiances at two wavelengths in the near-UV region while the solar zenith angle (SZA) changes from 60 to 90 degrees. A Brewer spectrophotometer was used for taking such measurements extending the SZA range down to 96 degrees. Analyzed data from the Spring of 1991 imply that observations at twilight are of great significance in improving ozone retrievals in the upper stratosphere. Judged by the variance reduction for <b>Umkehr</b> <b>layers</b> 9 to 12 (25 - 30 percent for layer 11) {{and the increase in}} separation and amplitude of the averaging kernels for the relevant layers, the ozone retrievals in the upper stratosphere are shown to be in better agreement with climatological means...|$|R
40|$|Monthly average ozone {{profiles}} {{from the}} first year of operation of the solar backscattered ultraviolet (SBUV) instrument on the Nimbus 7 satellite (November 1978 through October 1979) are tabulated for 10 deg latitude bands from 80 deg S to 80 deg N. For each month and latitude zone layer ozone amounts, standard deviations for 12 <b>Umkehr</b> <b>layers</b> (approximately 0 - 60 km), and the average total ozone for each zone are listed. The ozone mixing ratio and number density at the center of each layer are also given. It is found that the average SBUV profiles agree with average Umkehr profiles measured at Boulder to within 10 percent over most of the range. The Krueger-Minizner model is found to be a good representative ozone model for 45 deg N, agreeing with an annual average of measured profiles to better than 10 percent between 20 and 60 km...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} Dobson Umkehr methodology {{to retrieve}} coarse-resolution ozone profiles {{used by the}} National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration uses designated solar zenith angles (SZAs). However, some information may be lost if measurements lie outside the designated SZA range (between 60 ° and 90 °), or {{do not conform to}} the fitting technique. Also, while Umkehr measurements can be taken using multiple wavelength pairs (A, C and D), past retrieval methods have focused on a single pair (C). Here we present an Umkehr inversion method that uses measurements at all SZAs (termed operational) and all wavelength pairs. (Although, we caution direct comparison to other algorithms.) Information content for a Melbourne, Australia (38 ° S, 145 ° E) Umkehr measurement case study from 28 January 1994, with SZA range similar to that designated in previous algorithms is shown. When comparing the typical single wavelength pair with designated SZAs to the operational measurements, the total degrees of freedom (independent pieces of information) increases from 3. 1 to 3. 4, with the majority of the information gain originating from <b>Umkehr</b> <b>layers</b> 2 + 3 and 4 (10 – 20 km and 25 – 30 km respectively). In addition to this, using all available wavelength pairs increases the total degrees of freedom to 5. 2, with the most significant increases in <b>Umkehr</b> <b>layers</b> 2 + 3 to 7 and 9 + (10 – 40 and 45 – 80 km). Investigating a case from 13 April 1970 where the measurements extend beyond the 90 ° SZA range gives further information gain, with total degrees of freedom extending to 6. 5. Similar increases are seen in the information content. Comparing the retrieved Melbourne Umkehr time series with ozonesondes shows excellent agreement in layers 2 + 3 and 4 (10 – 20 and 25 – 30 km) for both C and A + C + D-pairs. Retrievals in layers 5 and 6 (25 – 30 and 30 – 35 km) consistently show lower ozone partial column compared to ozonesondes. This is likely due to stray light effects that are not accounted for in the forward model, and under represented stratospheric aerosol...|$|R

We estimate the effects of covariates – month, year (trend), quasi-biennial oscillation, the solar cycle, the Arctic oscillation, the El Niño/Southern Oscillation cycle and the Eliassen–Palm flux – on the principal component scores of ozone profiles using additive mixed effects models. The effects are represented as smooth functions and the smooth functions are estimated by penalized regression splines. We also impose a heteroscedastic error structure that reflects the observed seasonality in the errors. The more complex error structure enables us to provide more accurate estimates of influences and trends, together with enhanced uncertainty quantification. Also, we are able to capture fine variations in the time evolution of the profiles, such as the semi-annual oscillation.

40|$|Since mid-to late 1980 s {{decreasing}} {{amounts of}} ozone concentration {{has been observed}} in northern mid-latitudes mainly due to the ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbon loading in the stratosphere. Recent works indicate the stabilization of ozone loss in the mid-latitudes, in the upper stratosphere in particular. In order to further investigate the evolution of ozone in the mid-latitudes, a coherent dataset is required. As a first step, we diagnose the long term evolution of ozone at Observatoire de Haute Provence (OHP - 43. 93 °N, 5. 71 °E), one of the northern mid-latitude stations. In this study, we present the inter comparison of ozone measurements from OHP LIDAR with collocated SBUV, SAGEII, HALOE, MLS and GOMOS satellite observations {{as well as the}} ground based Ozonesondes and Umkehr measurements. A detailed statistical study on the relative differences of the compared measurements is performed to check any specific drifts with time. In addition, the seasonal and annual averages of the relative deviations are also checked to quantify agreement among the data. On average, all instruments show their best agreement with LIDAR between 20 and 40 km, where the differences are within 5 %. The agreement with SAGEII measurements are remarkably good since it falls within 1 % at 17 - 41 km. A similar result is also found from the Ozonesondes comparison at 22 - 31 km. Most comparisons exhibit slightly larger deviations below 20 and above 42 km, of about 10 %.

40|$|Solar {{backscattered}} ultraviolet (SBUV) ozone profiles have been compared with Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) II profiles {{over the period}} October 1984 through June 1990, when data are available from both instruments. SBUV measurements were selected to closely match the SAGE II latitude/longitude measurement pattern. There are {{significant differences between the}} SAGE II sunrise and the sunset zonal mean ozone profiles in the equatorial zone, particularly in the upper stratosphere, that may be connected with extreme SAGE II solar azimuth angles for tropical sunrise measurements. Calculation of the average sunset bias between SBUV and SAGE II ozone profiles shows that allowing for diurnal variation in <b>Umkehr</b> <b>layer</b> 10, SBUV and SAGE II agree to within +/- 5 % for the entire stratosphere in the northern midlatitude zone. The worst agreement is seen at southern midlatitudes near the ozone peak (disagreements of +/- 10 %), apparently the result of the SBUV ozone profile peaking at a lower altitude than SAGE. The integrated ozone columns (cumulative above 15 km) agree very well, to within +/- 2. 3 % in all zones for both sunset and sunrise measurements. A comparison of the time dependence of SBUV and SAGE II shows that there was less than +/- 5 % relative drift over the 5. 5 years for all altitudes except below 25 km, where the SBUV vertical resolution is poor. The best agreement with SAGE is seen in the integrated column ozone (cumulative above 15 km), where SAGE II has a 1 % negative trend relative to SBUV over the comparison period. There is a persistent disagreement of the two instruments in Umkehr layers 9 and 10 of +/- 4 % over the 5. 5 -year comparison period. In the equatorial zone this disagreement may be caused in part by a large positive trend (0. 8 K per year) in the National Meteorologica Center temperatures used to convert the SAGE II measurement of ozone density versus altitude to a pressure scale for comparison with SBUV. In the middle stratosphere (30 - 40 km), SBUV shows a 2 - 4 % negative drift relative to SAGE II. If the actual ozone trends are considered, SBUV and SAGE II agree in showing little ozone change (less than 2 %) between 1984 and 1990, except in layer 3 where SAGE II measures a large ozone decrease. But over 11 years, SBUV measured a 7 % per decade ozone decrease between 40 and 50 km, decreasing in magnitude at lower altitudes, in good agreement with 11 -year trends derived from the average of 5 Umkehr stations...|$|E

Regression time series models, which include seasonal and trend factors, are estimated for 13 stations located mainly in the midlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. At each station, trend estimates are calculated for 14 'fractional' <b>Umkehr</b> <b>layers</b> covering the altitude range from 0 to 33 km. For the 1970 - 1982 period, the main findings indicate an overall negative trend in ozonesonde data in the lower stratosphere (15 - 21 km) of about - 0. 5 percent per year, and some evidence of a positive trend in the troposphere (0 - 5 km) of about 0. 8 percent per year. An in-depth sensitivity study of the trend estimates is performed with respect to various correction procedures used to normalize ozonesonde readings to Dobson total ozone measurements.

The data sets are merged based upon comparisons during the 18 -month overlap period in which both instruments were operational. During this period, the average offset between the two time series is less than 2 % in total ozone, and less than 6 % in <b>Umkehr</b> <b>layers</b> 1 - 10. A linear-regression trend model is applied to the extended time series to calculate updated trends as a function of latitude and altitude.

In the lower stratosphere, the trends are nearly 1. 5 % per decade more negative in the southern hemisphere tropical regions to 25 deg S, but remain relatively unchanged elsewhere.

Comparing SAGE 2 -Umkehr differences to SAGE 1 version 5. 5 -Umkehr differences shows SAGE 2 higher {{than or equal}} to SAGE 1 relative to <b>Umkehr</b> in all <b>layers</b> except layer three. Adjustment for this bias would produce trends derived from SAGE 2 -SAGE 1 differences and Umkehr observations in the 1980 s more nearly equal to each other in layers six, seven, and eight. A possible explanation of these differences is a systematic shift in the reference altitude between SAGE 1 and SAGE 2, but there is no independent evidence of this. While the shape of the vertical profile of differences at 17 individual Umkehr stations (mostly in mid-latitudes) is generally consistent at all stations except at Poker Flat, Seoul, and Lauder, significant variation does exists among the stations. The profile of mean difference is similar to previously observed differences between Umkehr and both SAGE 2 and SBUV and also to an eigenvector analysis, but with site-dependent amplitude discrepancies. Because of the close correspondence of stratospheric aerosol optical depth at the SAGE 2 -measured 0. 525 micron wavelength and the extrapolated 0. 32 Umkehr wavelength determined in this study, we use the 0. 525 micron data to determine the aerosol effect of Umkehr profiles. The aerosol errors to the Umkehr ozone amounts in percent ozone amount per 0. 01 stratospheric aerosol optical depth range from plus 2 percent in layer six to minus 3 percent in layer nine. These results agree with previous theoretical and empirical studies within their respective error bounds in layers nine, eight, and five.
