25|$|An {{important}} element of the <b>urban</b> <b>sector</b> reform was that the government refrained from political interference and established tools to objectively and independently monitor the performance of ONEA. In the crucial field of cost recovery, a financial model of ONEA was developed in a participatory manner and applied, allowing the government to assess progress towards financial equilibrium of ONEA and providing an objective basis for further tariff revision requests. The government then approved requests for tariff increases submitted by the utility and justified by {{the outcome of the}} model’s calculations in a timely fashion, which was crucial to maintain the utility in good financial health. The Government also helped to strengthen the utility by not interfering with investment and staffing decisions and paying its water bills on time.|$|E

25|$|Child labour {{is still}} common {{in many parts}} of the world. Estimates for child labour vary. It ranges between 250 and 304 million, if {{children}} aged 5–17 involved in any economic activity are counted. If light occasional work is excluded, ILO estimates there were 153 million child labourers aged 5–14 worldwide in 2008. This is about 20 million less than ILO estimate for child labourers in 2004. Some 60 percent of the child labour was involved in agricultural activities such as farming, dairy, fisheries and forestry. Another 25 percent of child labourers were in service activities such as retail, hawking goods, restaurants, load and transfer of goods, storage, picking and recycling trash, polishing shoes, domestic help, and other services. The remaining 15 percent laboured in assembly and manufacturing in informal economy, home-based enterprises, factories, mines, packaging salt, operating machinery, and such operations. Two out of three child workers work alongside their parents, in unpaid family work situations. Some children work as guides for tourists, sometimes combined with bringing in business for shops and restaurants. Child labour predominantly occurs in the rural areas (70%) and informal <b>urban</b> <b>sector</b> (26%).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to extend the Fields’ (1989) multi sector job-search model in a three sector general {{equilibrium}} framework by introducing international trade and an input, capital. The three sectors are the rural <b>sector,</b> the <b>urban</b> informal <b>sector</b> and the <b>urban</b> formal <b>sector.</b> The rural <b>sector</b> and the <b>urban</b> informal <b>sector</b> use one type of mobile capital while the <b>urban</b> formal <b>sector</b> uses sector-specific another type of capital. We find that the effects of the inflow of foreign capital in the <b>urban</b> formal <b>sector</b> on unemployment and social welfare crucially hinge on the relative factor intensities of the rural and the <b>urban</b> informal <b>sectors.</b> We show that there is a possibility of a trade-off between the government’s twin objectives of improvement in social welfare and mitigation of the urban unemployment problem. These results are extremely crucial from the view of policymaking in an unemployment plagued, low-income developing economy. ...|$|R

2500|$|Another {{element of}} the <b>urban</b> <b>sector</b> reform was the {{decision}} to improve commercial practices of ONEA through a short-term performance-based service contract with a private company. The international bid for this five-year service contract was won by the French private operator Veolia in January 2001, {{two months before the}} World Bank’s announcement of a new US$70 million credit for water supply in Ouagadougou. The contract covered the management of customer service and bill collections on behalf of ONEA, but kept the technical operation of the system and the supervision of the contract {{in the hands of the}} public utility. The expatriates worked as deputies to local managers and the international operator had mostly an advisory role. Yet because of the performance-based nature of the contract, it also had a clear financial stake in the success of the technical assistance provided. According to a World Bank study, “the staff sent by the international operator proved to be seasoned professionals with many years of hands-on operational experience.” With their help ONEA’s commercial performance further improved, although this took some time. The collection ratio decreased during the first two years and improved only afterward, slightly increasing beyond the pre contract performance in year three, reaching 93 percent in year four and 95 percent in year five. In December 2008 ONEA became the first public water utility in Sub-Saharan Africa to be IS0 9001-certified. The World Bank today considers ONEA “a mature corporation, similar in all respects to a private corporation.” ...|$|E

30|$|This paper {{analyzes}} wage discrimination {{between gender}} and social (caste) groups in India using a set of simple models of wage determination. The term ‘caste’ in this paper refers to four broad caste divisions or social groups. These are SCs, STs, Other Backward Classes (OBCs), and ‘Others’. The last group includes those not covered in the first three. We also examine the gender differences in Non-Scheduled Castes/Tribes (NSC), and Scheduled Castes and Tribes (SC/ST). Most studies examine wage discrimination either between gender groups or between social groups in the rural or <b>urban</b> <b>sectors.</b> In this paper, we examine wage discrimination separately for the gender {{as well as for}} social groups in both the rural and <b>urban</b> <b>sectors.</b> The labor market conditions in India differ very much across the two sectors. For example, in rural India a large workforce is engaged in agricultural and allied activities. A separate examination of the rural and <b>urban</b> <b>sectors</b> may be helpful in identifying some of the important factors relating to gender and castes, and may provide inputs to rural and urban development policies. The analysis in the paper is based on a nationally representative dataset, namely, India Human Development Survey (IHDS) 2005.|$|R

30|$|This wave of rural–urban {{migration}} in China {{occurred in a}} unique institutional context. On the one hand, there is a long-standing residence registration (hukou) system in China designed to control the movement of people within the country (Chan and Zhang, 1999). Each individual is issued a residence permit, a so-called hukou, which gives the person the right {{to live in a}} jurisdiction and access local public goods such as public education and health care. If a person with a rural hukou wants to move to a city and work in <b>urban</b> <b>sectors,</b> he or she has to apply through the relevant bureaucracies. Since the mid- 1980 s, this system has been gradually relaxed and the controls have been weakened, primarily in response to the rapid expansion of the urban economy and the increased demand for cheap labor in <b>urban</b> <b>sectors.</b> However, although people with a rural hukou are now generally allowed to find work in urban areas, jobs in certain <b>urban</b> <b>sectors</b> are still reserved for residents with the local urban hukou, and the migrants from rural areas have very limited access to urban public goods.|$|R
