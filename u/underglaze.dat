25|$|The Worcester Porcelain Company was {{established}} in 1751, mainly producing high-quality blue <b>underglaze</b> painted china.|$|E
25|$|This {{technique}} was introduced for both <b>underglaze</b> and overglaze transfer in Worcester in the mid-1750s.|$|E

50|$|An archaeological {{excavation}} at the Tongguan kiln Site {{proved that}} the technology of <b>underglazed</b> color figure arose in the Tang and Five Dynasties periods and originated from Tonguan, Changsha.|$|R
25|$|At {{that time}} the potters in the region {{did not have the}} {{technology}} to make high-fire <b>underglaze</b> porcelain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Underglaze</b> {{painting}} requires {{considerably more}} skill than overglaze, since defects {{in the painting}} will often become visible only after the firing.|$|E

50|$|The Lonhuda Pottery Company {{was founded}} in Steubenville, Ohio, in 1892 by William Long and closed in 1896. It became known for brown <b>underglazes</b> and slip decoration. The ceramicist Laura Anne Fry worked for Lonhuda in 1892-93.|$|R
50|$|Valentien {{was born}} in Cincinnati, Ohio on 11 May 1862, to Anna Marie Wolter and Frederick Valentine. He studied art at the School of Design of the University of Cincinnati (later the Cincinnati Art Academy), working with Thomas S. Noble and Frank Duveneck. With fellow student John Rettig, Valentien studied {{decoration}} of china, learning <b>underglazed</b> pottery decoration from T(homas) J. Wheatley.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the more}} famous items is An'nan ware (安南焼), which was {{exported}} to Japan and used in Japanese tea ceremony although the high-footed bowls were originally used for food. The bowls had an everted rim, high foot, were <b>underglazed</b> with cobalt floral decorations, lappets above base, unglazed stacking rings in well and were brown washed on the base. The diameters can range from 9 to 15 centimetres. They were produced in the 16th and 17th century.|$|R
25|$|It {{can be used}} {{to print}} curved shapes such as mugs with <b>underglaze,</b> onglaze, glaze, wax resist and heated {{thermoplastic}} colors.|$|E
25|$|The technique, {{with its}} ability to {{transfer}} fine detail, is considered most suitable for onglaze decoration, {{although it has been}} used for <b>underglaze</b> images.|$|E
25|$|The same {{techniques}} {{are used to}} paint {{the various types of}} porcelain and earthenware, both <b>underglaze</b> and overglaze, but different pigments are used due to the different body characteristics and firing temperatures. Generally earthenware painting uses bolder, simpler designs, while china painting may be finer and more delicate.|$|E
50|$|After moulding, {{the pottery}} was first fired {{at a low}} {{temperature}} to produce a porous biscuit body onto which paint could be applied. The colours were then applied, followed by a lead glaze, a technique known as <b>underglazing.</b> The pottery was then fired again at a low temperature {{in order to preserve}} the colour, making the product soft and fragile and contributing to the scarcity of original Wemyss. Pottery produced by the Griselda Hill pottery uses a different technique, and is much more robust.|$|R
5000|$|Anhinga, in the {{collection}} of the Honolulu Museum of Art, is typical of her teapots, which usually incorporate birds into the design. It is made of hand-built porcelain, employing both <b>underglazes</b> and overglazes. [...] The Everson Museum of Art (Syracuse, New York), the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the National Museum of Ceramic Art (Baltimore, Maryland), the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Racine Art Museum (Racine, Wisconsin) are among the public collections holding work by Annette Corcoran.|$|R
50|$|To {{the south}} of the Şehzade {{mausoleum}} is the türbe of Grand Vizier Rüstem Pasha, which was also designed by Sinan. Rüstem Pasha was the son-in-law of Suleiman the Magnificent. Like the Rüstem Pasha Mosque it is decorated with a large number of <b>underglazed</b> Iznik tiles. By the gate to the complex is the türbe of Grand Vizier Ibrahim Pasha, son-in-law of Murat III, who died in 1601. The türbe was designed by Dalgıç Ahmed Çavuş, and almost equals that of Şehzade in design and use of tiled decoration.|$|R
25|$|The Japanese {{began to}} make {{porcelain}} early in the 17th century, learning from Chinese and Korean craftsmen how to fire the pieces and make <b>underglaze</b> blue cobalt decoration and overglaze enamel painting. In the mid-17th century the Japanese found a growing market from European traders who were unable to obtain Chinese porcelain due to political upheavals.|$|E
25|$|Jingdezhen {{was among}} the first {{porcelain}} manufacturing centers in the south of China, with ready access to kaolin and petunse. In its day it was the world's most important center of porcelain production. Jingdezhen ware includes the famous decorated Qingbai pieces with shadow-blue glazes. Under the Yuan dynasty the use of <b>underglaze</b> cobalt blue decoration became popular.|$|E
25|$|The first soft paste {{porcelain}} {{manufactured in}} Britain came from factories in London, soon followed by factories in Staffordshire, Derby and Liverpool. The painter and mezzotintist Thomas Frye (1710–62) produced fine bone china at his Bow porcelain factory in East London. Bone china was also made at Lowestoft, at first mainly decorated in <b>underglaze</b> blue but later with Chinese-style over-glaze that also included pink and red.|$|E
50|$|Tin glazing {{creates a}} {{brilliant}} white, opaque surface for painting. The colours are applied as metallic oxides or as fritted <b>underglazes</b> to the unfired glaze, which absorbs pigment like fresco, making errors impossible to fix, but preserving the brilliant colors. Sometimes {{the surface is}} covered with a second glaze (called coperta by the Italians) that lends greater shine and brilliance to the wares. In the case of lustred wares, a further firing at a lower temperature is required. Kilns required wood as well as suitable clay. Glaze was made from sand, wine lees, lead compounds and tin compounds.|$|R
5000|$|Kraak ware {{is almost}} all {{painted in the}} <b>underglazed</b> cobalt blue style that was perfected under the Ming dynasty, {{although}} {{a few examples of}} dishes over-painted with vitreous enamel glaze have survived (see for example this dish in the Princessehof Museum, Leeuwarden http://www.aziatischekeramiek.nl/get?alias=ak&id=i000273&view=ak&searchpage=zoeken). It is often decorated with variations on the more traditional motifs found on Chinese porcelain, such as stylized flowers (peonies and chrysanthemums) and Buddhist auspicious emblems. However, most characteristic of Kraak decoration is the use of foliated radial panels. In other words, the surface of the porcelain is divided into segments, each containing its own discrete image (see example in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ewpor/ho_1995.268.1.htm#).|$|R
50|$|Hugh C. Robertson, (1845-1908), was an American studio potter who is {{the first}} {{recognized}} potter to have worked with nonrepresentational ceramic decoration glazes. Robertson apprenticed at the Jersey City Potter in 1860. In 1868, he started work in his father's shop that opened in 1866 in Chelsea, Massachusetts. In 1872 the factory was incorporated into the Chelsea Keramic Art Works (CKAW). The company became known for their antique Grecian terra cotta and Pompeian bronzes. In 1877, Robertson developed the Chelsea faience, <b>underglazed</b> opaque earthenware, which lead the development of other American faience. There in 1884, Robertson worked on discovering the secret Chinese glaze, Sang-de-Boeuf. In 1888, he finally discovered the recipe for the glaze and produced three hundred pieces of what he dubbed, Sang de Chelses.|$|R
25|$|Cliff {{was given}} a second {{apprenticeship}} at A. J. Wilkinson's in 1924 (when she was already 25 years old) primarily as a 'modeller' but she also worked with the factory designers John Butler and Fred Ridgway. They produced conservative, Victorian style ware – Butler had been the designer for over 20 years by this time. Eventually, Cliff's wide range of skills were recognised and in 1927 she was given her own studio at the adjoining Newport Pottery which Shorter had bought in 1920. Here Cliff was allowed to decorate {{some of the old}} defective 'glost' (white) ware in her own freehand patterns. For these she used on-glaze enamel colours, which enabled a brighter palette than <b>underglaze</b> colours.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} Conquest, European style pottery came to {{dominate}} the area {{now known as the}} state of Guanajuato. During the colonial period, the city of Guanajuato had a strong Majolica tradition along with Puebla, which is being revived. These pieces are made with a tortilla mold for irregular shapes or by wheel. It is given an <b>underglaze,</b> usually a light cream color, fired, then painted with a design, glazed and fired again. Many of the motifs are made with colors such as yellow, blue-green, rust and blue. Principle makers in Guanajuato city are Gorky Gonzalez, who maintains traditional designs, and the Alfarería Capelo Mayolica, which produces large pieces with more intense and darker colors. In Santa Rosa de Lima, a group of former students of Capelo also make majolica.|$|E
500|$|The wreck held {{three main}} types of [...] "wares" [...] {{in the form}} of bowls: [...] (produced in kilns in Tongguan), the {{majority}} of the 60,000 items, were originally packed in either straw cylinders or [...] "Dusun" [...] storage jars; White-ware, manufactured in the Ding kilns and including the earliest known intact <b>underglaze</b> blue and white dishes; and Yue ware from Zhejiang Province. One Changsha bowl was inscribed with a date: [...] "16th day of the seventh month of the second year of the Baoli reign", or 826 AD. This was later confirmed by radiocarbon dating of star anise found amongst the wreck. The cargo had a surprising variety of influences and markets, including Buddhist lotus symbols, motifs from Central Asia and Persia, Koranic inscriptions, and green-splashed bowls popular in Iran.|$|E
40|$|Throughout the Story of Art we {{find that}} many artists {{attempted}} to explore the human form in various situations and ways. Artists used a diversity of media lilke paint, glass, wood, marble, metal and Stone to create images of humanity. Amongst these mediums we find clay. Clay {{has been used to}} honour gods, kings and human achievements. It has been also used to express social and religious ideals. Amongst Maltese artists who use clay as their main artistic expression, we find Mario Sammut who enjoys a privileged place as one of the active ceramic artists. In his continuous research in the art of ceramics he uses different methods and techniques with the application of <b>underglazes</b> and coloured oxides in order to create sculptural forms which have a harmonious balance of texture, shape and line.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{creative}} project was to research, build, and replicate portions {{of the history of}} the town of Bradford, Ohio in order to create a permanent community monument. Glazed tiles were mounted together to form an artpiece four feet by sixteen feet, preserved for future generations to appreciate and enjoy. Upon completion of research on the community, drawings of area business establishmentswere diligently developed for the clay bas relief tiles, which were sculptured by the artist and his Art I-IV students. Individual clay tiles, composed of terra-cotta stoneware, were bisque fired, <b>underglazed,</b> and refired. To mount the tiles, concrete was applied to sections of plywood (which had been covered with chicken wire). The stoneware tiles were then organized, arranged, and embedded in concrete to create a mosaic mural. The process of the mural forged an unmistakable bond between teacher, students, school, and community. The completed mosaic mural was framed and permanently mounted on location at the Bradford Public Library, 138 E. Main Street, Bradford, Ohio, involving the remodelling of the facility to accommodate the sculpture's size. Department of ArtThesis (M. A. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{an artist}} I have chosen Surface Images on Geometric Forms. My primary goal in adding surface images to {{geometric}} forms was essentially {{to capture and}} hold the viewer's interest on an otherwise simple piece of sculpture. The nude {{was chosen as the}} subject matter in an effort to capture attention. The method of combining a two-dimensional figure with a three-dimensional object was used in order to create an unusual illusion which would maintain the viewer's interest on the piece. In an effort to establish {{the most effective way to}} represent the illusion of a three-dimensional surface design, the building methods progressed through three stages. They varied from ceramic tile, to hand-built slab forms, and ended with ceramic slip casting. The techniques for adding the surface design to the very basic sculptural shapes varied in an attempt to find the most expressive way to illustrate the designs in a manner which permitted the viewer to visualize the diversity of the different materials used in the surface design consisted of a relationship between various combinations of <b>underglazes,</b> overglazes, metallic lusters, decals, and photographic emulsions. Through the use of decal images it was possible to create unusual patterns that when viewed from afar produced an overall visual texture-shadows and outlines. Particular attention was given here to the use the decals to subdue the negative space. When studying the decal patterns closely, they reveal animals, people, cartoon characters and Greek letters, all containing minute details. After satisfactorily completing several cube forms, evaluation revealed that some modification of the sculptural form was required, the cube was too confining. Too many corners and edges prohibited the surface design from achieving the full three dimensional perspective that was being sought. In an effort to achieve a greater sense of flowing line, the slab was modified from a cube to a column. The building and surface design methods remained the same with the column as with the cubes. Since the column had no corners, the surface figures fit more naturally around it than on the previous geometric forms. Furthering the concept of roundness, the column led to the sphere. The sphere essentially proved most suitable in that it had no edges. The surface design could then fit continuously and uninterrupted on this form. After a long period of experimentation with different images and materials, concluded that the importance of the image into the form was most essential. Even though the major focus was on the surface design itself in the beginning, the importance of the sculptural form and the interdependence of the two became increasingly clear, as did the importance of the method chosen for display and presentation. Concomitantly, therefore, increased experimentation with the techniques of exhibition concluded that studying the sculptures from approximately eye level provided the best view for full perimeter observation. In order to finalize the feeling of being completely three- dimensional, the sculpture was placed on a highly reflective acrylic surface to give the impression of floating rather than being attached to a surface plane...|$|R
2500|$|At {{first the}} decorations were hand painted. Around 1755 the factory {{introduced}} overglaze transfer printing, and in 1757–58 introduced <b>underglaze</b> blue transfer printing.|$|E
2500|$|With <b>underglaze</b> painting, as {{its name}} implies, the paint is applied to an {{unglazed}} object, which is then covered with glaze and fired.|$|E
2500|$|Typically {{the body}} is first fired in a kiln to convert it into a hard porous bisque. <b>Underglaze</b> {{decoration}} may then be applied, followed by glaze, which is fired so it bonds to the body. The glazed porcelain may then be painted with overglaze decoration and fired again to bond the paint with the glaze. Most pieces use only one of <b>underglaze</b> or overglaze painting, the latter often being referred to as [...] "enamelled". Decorations may be applied by brush or by stenciling, transfer printing, lithography and screen printing.|$|E
40|$|The Khorāsān, a vast {{territory}} covering northern Afghanistan, north-eastern Iran {{and some}} parts of Central Asia, now {{is limited to a}} region in the north-eastern modern Iran divided into three provinces; i. e., Razavi Khorāsān, North Khorāsān and South Khorāsān. From {{the last quarter of the}} twelfth century to the first quarter of the thirteenth century, this territory was in the hands of Khwārazmshāhids in a short interval between the Seljuk and Mongol periods. The history of the Khwārazmshāhids began with the Anush Tigin reign in 1077 AD and declined in 1220 AD by the Mongol conquest, and at the summit of this period their land stretched from the Zagros Mountains (west of Iran) to the borders of India. During the Khwārazmshāhid period, several important buildings were erected of which six have been survived in Khorasan; i. e., the Masjed-e Jāmeʿ-e Gonābād, the Zuzan mosque, the Farumad Mosque, the Masjed-e Jāmeʿ-e Sangān-e Pāʾin, the Masjed-e Jāmeʿ-e Ferdows and the Khosrowshir mosque. The Masjed-e Jāmeʿ-e Gonābād (1212 AD) and the Zuzan mosque show a typical style of this period; the two-iwan plan that these mosques are based on, and brickwork combined with insets glazed ornaments to cover the facades. Accordingly, the Farumad Mosque, the Masjed-e Jāmeʿ-e Sangān-e Pāʾin, the Masjed-e Jāmeʿ-e Ferdows and the Khosrowshir mosque can be built or decorated in the Khwārazmshāhid period. The results obtained from on site investigations showed that the arranged, borida and tarāshida (forming the brick-based elements to create the patterns by cutting and carving the normal fired brick respectively) are the techniques widely used in the pre-Khwārazmshāhid buildings. The pish-shekli (forming the wet brick paste by cutting, engraving, moulding, etc. before any firing treatment) is another technique for producing brick-based ornaments before the Khwārazmshāhids. Besides, engraving the surface of plain brick courses, the so-called pas-tarāshida technique, is also employed to create the decorative patterns at a few monuments before and contemporary with the Khwārazmshāhid period beyond the Khorāsān's frontiers. As far as the architectural decorations of above-mentioned monuments are concerned, the pish-shekli and borida bricks are mainly used to decoratethe Masjed-e Jāmeʿ-e Gonābād while borida and tarāshida bricks decorate the façades of the madrasa/mosque of Zuzan where the found pish-shekli elements are attributed to its destroyed pre-Khwārazmshāhid buildings. The glazed ornaments of the Masjed-e Jāmeʿ-e Gonābād (hobnail and small triangular pieces) are turquoise in colour although turquoise, blue-dark and white glazes with different shapes are used to decorate the façades of the Zuzan mosque. In addition, brickwork combined with glazed elements decorates the undated above-mentioned monuments. The majority of the brick-based embellishments at the Masjed-e Jāmeʿ-e Ferdows and Masjed-e Jāmeʿ-e Sangān-e Pāʾin are pish-shekli elements with different shapes, sizes and motifs combined with glazed ornaments. The pish-shekli bricks at the Masjed-e Jāmeʿ-e Ferdows contain geometric patterns and the triangular turquoise glazed pieces are cut from an older inscription. In the contrary, the pish-shekli bricks at the Masjed-e Jāmeʿ-e Sangān-e Pāʾin are composed of floral patterns (with less frequent geometric patterns and epigraphy) with special shapes. The glazed ornaments of this mosque are some circular elements on which the word al-Molk is applied. On the other hand, the brickwork in the mosque of Farumad are executed in moulded and stamped pish-shekli elements with geometric and floral patterns however there are two friezes with carved pish-shekli elements in this monument. Insets with glazed ornaments (turquoise and less frequent dark-blue, lustre and <b>underglazed</b> painted) are occasionally employed to decorate the façades of the courtyard of the Farumad mosque. Moreover, in the semi-ruined mosque of Khosrowshir, beside the moulded and stamped brick-based decorations, similar to those at the Farumad mosque, the carved pish-shekli and tarāshida bricks are also employed. Likewise, two glazed architectural decorations were found in the surface survey around this mosque. Analytical studies took another important part of studies performed on the brickwork and glazed ornaments of the above-mentioned monuments. More than hundred samples, including brickwork decorations, glazed elements, structural bricks and glaze together with local clays were collected were subject of various analytical methods such as wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (WDXRF) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Besides, micro-Raman spectroscopy (μ-Raman), micro X-ray fluorescence (μ-XRF), scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDX) and thin section petrography were used to respond to the occasional technological questions. Principal component analysis (PCA) was also used to handle the compositional data of the bodies and glazes. Handling the data obtained by WDXRF by PCA, the bodies were classfied into two main categories in terms of the SiO 2 concentration; that is, clay bodies and stone-paste bodies. Accordingly, beside the clay-based brickwork, the glazed decorations of the mosques of Gonābād, Ferdows and Khosrowshir were made on stone-paste bodies while those of the Zuzan mosque were applied on both clay-based and stone-paste bodies. Moreover, the results showed that the chemical composition of the samples of the Gonābād, Khosrowshir and Zuzan were different while the Ferdows’ samples were grouped with those of the Zuzan mosque. Moreover, statistically handling the WDXRF data on the clay bodies, it was proved that most of clay bodies were made of local clays except the samples of the Zuzan mosque. Furthermore, WDXRF, performed on the clay-bodies, showed that most of the samples of the Farumad mosque, with three exceptions, were grouped in a separate cluster. A strong correlation of Mg and Cr accounted for the clay bodies of the Farumad mosque showed that the clay used in the bodies was most probably supplied from the local clay sources near Farumad. Concerning the glazes, cross sections of the glazed bodies under polarised light microscope showed a priming white layer between bodies and glazes in most of the stone-paste samples. Moreover, the ICP-MS results suggested that cobalt and copper were the main colouring agents of the glazes which are responsible for dark-blue and turquoise colours respectively. Handling the ICP-MS data by PCA, it was shown that all the glazes were basically alkali in nature to which Pb and Sn were added to opacify some glazes. The reddish (or buff) colour of the clay bodies was, in fact, covered with tin-opacified glazes to cover the reddish colour of the bodies although opacified glazes were occasionally observed on stone-paste bodies...|$|R
