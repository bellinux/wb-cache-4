25|$|Dubeolsik, which shares its symbol layout {{with the}} QWERTY keyboard, {{is much more}} {{commonly}} used. While Korean consonants and vowels (jamo) are grouped together into syllabic grids when written, the script is essentially alphabetical, and therefore typing in Korean is quite simple for those who understand the Korean alphabet Hangul. Each jamo is assigned to a single key. As the <b>user</b> <b>types</b> letters, the computer automatically groups them into syllabic characters. Given a sequence of jamo, {{there is only one}} unambiguous way letters can be validly grouped into syllables, so the computer groups them together as the <b>user</b> <b>types.</b>|$|E

Other protocol handlers and IFilters can be installed as needed.|$|E

25|$|Lisp {{languages}} {{are often used}} with an interactive command line, which may be combined with an integrated development environment (IDE). The <b>user</b> <b>types</b> in expressions at the command line, or directs the IDE to transmit them to the Lisp system. Lisp reads the entered expressions, evaluates them, and prints the result. For this reason, the Lisp command line is called a read–eval–print loop (REPL).|$|E
25|$|In November 14, 2007, Tucows {{disclosed}} that they offer pay-per-click advertising {{on the pages}} of domains within their domain name portfolio. When a <b>user</b> <b>types</b> one of these domain names into the address of the browser (direct navigation), they are presented with dynamically generated links which are pay-per-click advertising. Every time a user clicks on one of the links listed on a web page, it generates revenue for Tucows through its partnership with third parties who provide syndicated pay-per-click results.|$|E
25|$|Asynchronous JavaScript and JSON (or AJAJ) {{refers to}} the same dynamic web page {{methodology}} as Ajax, but instead of XML, JSON is the data format. AJAJ is a web development technique that provides for {{the ability of a}} webpage to request new data after it has loaded into the web browser. Typically it renders new data from the server in response to user actions on that webpage. For example, what the <b>user</b> <b>types</b> into a search box, client-side code then sends to the server, which immediately responds with a drop-down list of matching database items.|$|E

25|$|The Omnibox is a URL {{box that}} {{combines}} {{the functions of}} both the address bar and search box. If a user enters the URL of a site previously searched from, Chrome allows pressing Tab to search the site again directly from the Omnibox. When a user starts typing in the Omnibox, Chrome provides suggestions for previously visited sites (based on the URL or in-page text), popular websites (not necessarily visited before powered by Google Instant), and popular searches. Although Instant can be turned off, suggestions based on previously visited sites cannot be turned off. Chrome will also autocomplete the URLs of sites visited often. If a <b>user</b> <b>types</b> keywords into the Omnibox that don't match any previously visited websites and presses enter, Chrome will conduct the search using the default search engine.|$|E
500|$|In the {{computer}} era, spacing between sentences is handled {{in several different}} ways by various software packages. [...] Some systems accept whatever the <b>user</b> <b>types,</b> while others attempt to alter the spacing, or use the user input {{as a method of}} detecting sentences. [...] Computer-based word processors, and typesetting software such as troff and TeX, allow users to arrange text in a manner previously only available to professional typesetters.|$|E
2500|$|Numbers uses {{a hybrid}} {{approach}} {{to the creation of}} formulas, supporting the use of named data like Improv, but implementing them in-sheet like Excel. In basic operation, Numbers can be used just like Excel; data can be typed anywhere and formulas can be created by referring to the data by its cell. However, if the <b>user</b> <b>types</b> a header into the table, something one normally does as a matter of course, Numbers uses this to automatically construct a named range for the cells on that row or column. For instance, if the <b>user</b> <b>types</b> [...] "month" [...] into A1, and then types the names [...] "January", [...] "February", etc. into the cells below it, Numbers constructs a named range for the cells A2 through A13 and gives it the name [...] "month". The same is true when the <b>user</b> <b>types</b> in the figures for [...] "sales" [...] and [...] "income". The user can then write the averaging formula in a category-like text format, = total income / cars sold. The formula will find the appropriate data and calculate the results independent of the row. Like Improv, this formula does not refer to the physical location of the data in the sheet, so the sheet can be dramatically modified without causing the formula to fail.|$|E

[...] Like all Unix shells, it supports [...] filename globbing (wildcard matching), piping, here documents, command substitution, variables, and control structures for condition-testing and iteration. The keywords, syntax and other basic features of the language are all copied from sh. [...] Other features, e.g., history, are copied from csh and ksh.
