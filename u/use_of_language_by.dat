Crow contrasts this work with Jasper Johns’s [...] "anonymous stenciling", drawing attention to the way Hedrick mimics the flamboyant calligraphy found in the decoration of hot-rod cars. Crow sees the work in contrast to Johns’s reticence, as a protest aimed against the waste of lives in Korea, and at Cold War adventurism in general. Additionally, Peace (1953), [...] "demonstrates an intuitive understanding of 'language as symbol' which predates the present postmodern <b>use</b> (<b>of</b> <b>language)</b> <b>by</b> twenty years. Hedrick’s pre-pop paintings were included in John Coplan’s historical “Pop Art, USA," [...] the first exhibition to attempt a collective look at the movement in the United States, presented at the Oakland Art Museum during September, 1963.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>languages</b> <b>by</b> foreign students in learning the Indonesian language for foreign speakers (BIPA).

5000|$|After World War II, {{during the}} late 1940s and 1950s, {{analytic}} philosophy became involved with ordinary-language analysis. This resulted in two main trends. One continued Wittgenstein's later philosophy, which differed dramatically from his early work of the Tractatus. The other, known as [...] "Oxford philosophy", involved J. L. Austin. In contrast to earlier analytic philosophers (including the early Wittgenstein) who thought philosophers should avoid the deceptive trappings of natural language by constructing ideal languages, ordinary-language philosophers claimed that ordinary language already represented {{a large number of}} subtle distinctions that had been unrecognized by the formulation of traditional philosophical theories or problems. While schools such as logical positivism emphasize logical terms, supposed to be universal and separate from contingent factors (such as culture, language, historical conditions), ordinary-language philosophy emphasizes the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> <b>by</b> ordinary people. The most prominent ordinary-language philosophers during the 1950s were Austin and Gilbert Ryle.|$|E

50|$|Rhetoric {{can also}} {{be defined as the}} {{strategic}} use of language: each scientist tries to make those statements that - given the statements made by their colleagues, and the ones the former expects they will do in the future (e.g., accepting or rejecting the claims made by the former) - maximise the chances of the former's attaining the goals he or she has. So, game theory can be applied to study the choice of the claims one scientist makes. Zamora Bonilla (2006) argues that, when rhetoric is understood this way, it can be discussed whether the way scientists interact - e.g., through certain scientific institutions like peer review - leads them to make their claims in an efficient or an inefficient way, i.e., whether the 'rhetorical games' are more analogous to 'invisible hand' processes, or to 'prisoner's dilemma' games. If the former is the case, then we can assert that scientific 'conversation' is organised {{in such a way that}} the strategic <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> <b>by</b> scientists leads them to reach cognitive progress, and if the opposite is the case, then this would be an argument to reform scientific institutions.|$|E

Since language is often the basis for monitoring and tracking learning gains in comprehension, content knowledge and tool use {{in and out of}} school the role of situated cognition in language learning activities is important. Membership and interaction in social and cultural groups is often determined by tools, technologies and discourse use for full participation. Language learning or literacy in various social and cultural groups must include how the groups work with and interact with these texts. Language instruction in the context of situated cognition also involves the skilled or novice <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> <b>by</b> members of the group, and instruction of not only the elements of language, but what is needed to bring a student to the level of expert. Originating from emergent literacy, specialist-language lessons examines the formal and informal styles and discourses of language use in socio-cultural contexts. A function of specialist-language lessons includes [...] "lucidly functional language", or complex specialist language is usually accompanied by clear and lucid language used to explain the rules, relationships or meanings existing between language and meaning.|$|E
