Col Garnons Williams was in temporary command of the 12th Royal Fusiliers when on 25 September he led his battalion in an attack on German trenches. However, the flanks were exposed and on 27 September, Garnons Williams gave the order to retreat. He was at that moment shot in the head from a house nearby. The soldier who gave the account said: [...] "I was very sorry for him, as we could not have had a better, braver officer. He was with <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time in the front trench, and looked after us as well as he could; no man could have done better. Nobody could get back to him."

500|$|The actress {{described}} {{the filming of}} the rape as easier than the scenes depicting its aftermath, which she called [...] "psychologically ..... physically hard". Strickland and Brendon agreed on a safeword when they filmed the rape, due to its brutality. The scene affected Strickland {{to the extent that}} she found it difficult to act on the set on which the rape was shot. The actress called the filming process [...] "intense" [...] and [...] "truthful", but [...] "by no means is any of that even comparable to anything that women and men have had experience with". Brendon was cast against type as McHenry, King's rapist, since he is primarily known for portraying the comedic Xander Harris in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Strickland said that Brendon's character should not be interpreted as crazy, because perpetrators of rape are [...] "people who are around <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time"; she called Brendon's acceptance of the role [...] "brave".|$|E
500|$|Watchmen {{was first}} {{mentioned}} publicly in the 1985 Amazing Heroes Preview.

Speaking in 1986, Moore said, [...] "DC backed <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way [...] and have been really supportive about even the most graphic excesses". To promote the series, DC Comics released a limited-edition badge ("button") display card set, featuring characters and images from the series. Ten thousand sets of the four badges, including a replica of the blood-stained smiley face badge worn by the Comedian in the story, were released and sold. Mayfair Games introduced a Watchmen module for its DC Heroes Role-playing Game series that was released before the series concluded. The module, which was endorsed by Moore, adds details to the series' backstory by portraying events that occurred in 1966.|$|E

Catesby had not then given up hope on foreign help, and so he sent Wintour to the continent {{to meet with the}} Constable of Castille. [...] Wintour also met with Welsh spy Hugh Owen, who introduced him to Guy Fawkes, a man with whose name Catesby was familiar. [...] A fifth conspirator, Thomas Percy, joined them several weeks later. [...] Percy was related to the Wright family by marriage, having wed John's sister, Martha. [...] The group met on 20 May 1604 at the Duck and Drake inn, in the fashionable Strand district of London.

So that night I went to the studio and I was telling Chris about (the meeting). And he was like, 'Let's get on it.'

He continued to explain how he, Rihanna and Brown developed the song in the recording studio, saying [...] "When her, Chris and myself were in the room, it's fun. That's when the music isn't work at all. It's all freestyle. Chris comes up with an idea; I come up with one. Rihanna will weigh in. And we build." [...] The song leaked on January 6, 2009. Their version of the song was excluded from the soundtrack, in favor of a version performed by the American girl group The Pussycat Dolls.|$|E
500|$|A major {{sticking}} point over NHL participation {{has been the}} insurance of players; for the 2014 Winter Olympics, the IOC paid around US$7 million to insure NHL players participating in the Games. In April 2016, the IOC announced that beginning in 2018, {{it would no longer}} cover accommodations, insurance, or travel for NHL players in the Olympics, prompting the IIHF to ask for support from national ice hockey associations and National Olympic Committees to help cover costs; Matti Nurminen of the Finnish Ice Hockey Association argued that it was the responsibility of the event's organizer to cover costs, and that [...] "In our opinion, the same party should pay the bills, and that’s not <b>us.</b> <b>All</b> <b>the</b> countries replied to the IIHF that they are not willing to pay for the insurance or the travel {{or any of the other}} expenses that are related to having the NHL players participate in Pyeongchang." [...] The New York Times felt that the removal of this financial support would put NHL participation at Pyeongchang in jeopardy, noting the already-strenuous relationship between the NHL and the IOC; Gary Bettman noted that the NHL does not profit from their presence, adding that [...] "in fact, we kind of disappear for two weeks because historically the IOC hasn't even let us join in promoting our participation in the Olympics." ...|$|E
