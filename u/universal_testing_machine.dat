Tensile and flexural tests were conducted on <b>universal</b> <b>test</b> <b>machine</b> as per standards. The result shows that the tensile strength increased with increasing strain rate. However the flexural strength decreased with increasing strain rate. Both tensile and flexural strength are maximum for carbon based FML structures, minimum for glass based FML and hybrid FML structure lies between them. The observations on both tensile and flexural failure mechanisms deduced from a microscopic study of the fractured specimens are presented...|$|R

40|$|A bespoke {{test rig}} has been {{designed}} to facilitate testing of magneto-rheological (MR) elastomers (MREs) under equi-biaxial tension using a standard <b>universal</b> <b>test</b> <b>machine.</b> <b>Tests</b> were performed up to 10 % strain on both isotropic and anisotropic MREs with and without the application of an external magnetic field. Assumptions regarding the material's response were used to analyse stress–strain results in the two stretching directions. The assumptions have been verified previously by uniaxial tension tests and by simulations of the magnetic flux distribution performed using a commercial multi-physics finite element software. The MR effect, which is defined as the increase in tangent modulus at a given strain, has been studied versus engineering strain. The latter was measured optically in the experiments using a digital image correlation system. Relative MR effects up to 74 % were found when the particle alignment of anisotropic MREs was oriented parallel to an applied magnetic induction of just 67. 5 mT...|$|R
