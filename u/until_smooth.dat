5000|$|The {{creaming}} {{method is}} frequently used for cake batters. The {{butter and sugar}} are [...] "creamed", or beaten together <b>until</b> <b>smooth</b> and fluffy.

Clarified butter, vegetable oils, bacon drippings or lard are commonly used fats. Roux {{is used as a}} thickening agent for gravy, sauces, soups and stews.

The dried chili pod must be soaked, seeded, and then drained of excess water.The lemongrass stalks {{need to be}} thinly sliced and fresh galangal should be diced. If fresh or brine-soaked turmeric is used, it must be diced as well. Kaffir lime zest must be sliced into thin strips and Kaffir lime leaves require deveining and thinly chopping. The ingredients are then added to the mortar and pounded, usually lime zest/leaves first <b>until</b> <b>smooth,</b> then chili, lemongrass, galangal, and turmeric, until a deep red color is achieved.

50|$|Besides their {{importance}} in describing birational transformations, blowups are {{also an important}} way of constructing new spaces.

50|$|In most light {{aircraft}}, as {{the stall}} is reached, the aircraft {{will start to}} descend (because the wing is no longer producing enough lift to support the aircraft's weight) and the nose will pitch down. Recovery from the stall involves lowering the aircraft nose, to decrease the angle of attack and increase the air speed, <b>until</b> <b>smooth</b> air-flow over the wing is restored. Normal flight can be resumed once recovery is complete. The maneuver is normally quite safe and if correctly handled leads to only a small loss in altitude (20-30 m/50'-100'). It is taught and practised in order for pilots to recognize, avoid, and recover from stalling the aircraft. A pilot is required to demonstrate competency in controlling an aircraft during and after a stall for certification, {{and it is a}} routine maneuver for pilots when getting to know the handling of a new aircraft type. The only dangerous aspect of a stall is a lack of altitude for recovery.|$|E
50|$|Restoration of a vehicle’s {{exterior}} {{can take many}} forms. A vehicle that has been left or abandoned will often accumulate rust over time. Sometimes this rust deterioration can render an exterior part unusable. In which case a replacement part like a fender, front grill or door mirror much be purchased outright from an external source. If rust damage is minor however the part will undergo rust repair. This {{is the process of}} removing rust from metal and returning structural integrity. This is accomplished by removing the rust through sanding or blasting to get down to bare metal. Then new sheet metal or fiberglass is applied to the affected area. Finally the piece is worked <b>until</b> <b>smooth,</b> primed and re-painted. Other materials like glass and weather stripping must be replaced as they become damaged over time. Factors like weather erosion can lead to faded and broken glass as well as dried out weather stripping. Another typical area of exterior repair is dent removal. This entails taking the original metal and re-working it to remove dents and other such blemishes. Professionals often use hammer and dolly work to remove dents. This involves placing the dented metal piece over a curved metal dolly and using an electric or manual hammer to remove the dent and smooth the metal.|$|E
