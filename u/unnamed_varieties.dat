60|$|In {{the last}} chapter I gave two cases of a peach-almond and a double- flowered almond which {{suddenly}} produced fruit closely resembling true peaches. I have also given many cases of peach-trees producing buds, which, when developed into branches, have yielded nectarines. We have seen that no less than six named and several <b>unnamed</b> <b>varieties</b> of the peach have thus produced several varieties of nectarine. I have shown that it is highly improbable that all these peach-trees, {{some of which are}} old varieties, and have been propagated by the million, are hybrids from the peach and nectarine, and that it is opposed to all analogy to attribute the occasional production of nectarines on peach-trees to the direct action of pollen from some neighbouring nectarine-tree. Several of the cases are highly remarkable, because, firstly, the fruit thus produced has sometimes been in part a nectarine and in part a peach; secondly, because nectarines thus suddenly produced have reproduced themselves by seed; and thirdly, because nectarines are produced from peach-trees from seed as well as from buds. The seed of the nectarine, on the other hand, occasionally produces peaches; and we have seen in one instance that a nectarine-tree yielded peaches by bud-variation. As the peach is certainly the oldest or primary variety, the production of peaches from nectarines, either by seeds or buds, may perhaps be considered as a case of reversion. Certain trees have also been described as indifferently bearing peaches or nectarines, and this may be considered as bud-variation carried to an extreme degree.|$|E
60|$|Two {{explanations}} {{have been}} suggested to account for these conversions. First, that the parent trees have been in every case hybrids (10/53. Alph. De Candolle 'Geograph. Bot.' page 886.) between the peach and nectarine, and have reverted by bud-variation or by seed {{to one of their}} pure parent forms. This view in itself is not very improbable; for the Mountaineer peach, which was raised by Knight from the red nutmeg-peach by pollen of the violette hative nectarine (10/54. Thompson in Loudon's 'Encyclop. of Gardening' page 911.), produces peaches, but these are said SOMETIMES to partake of the smoothness and flavour of the nectarine. But let it be observed that in the previous list no less than six well-known varieties and several <b>unnamed</b> <b>varieties</b> of the peach have once suddenly produced perfect nectarines by bud variation: and it would be an extremely rash supposition that all these varieties of the peach, which have been cultivated for years in many districts, and which show not a vestige of a mixed parentage, are, nevertheless, hybrids. A second explanation is, that the fruit of the peach has been directly affected by the pollen of the nectarine: although this certainly is possible, it cannot here apply; for we have not a shadow of evidence that a branch which has borne fruit directly affected by foreign pollen is so profoundly modified as afterwards to produce buds which continue to yield fruit of the new and modified form. Now it is known that when a bud on a peach-tree has once borne a nectarine the same branch has in several instances gone on during successive years producing nectarines. The Carclew nectarine, on the other hand, first produced half-and-half fruit, and subsequently pure peaches. Hence we may confidently accept the common view that the nectarine is a variety of the peach, which may be produced either by bud-variation or from seed. In the following chapter many analogous cases of bud-variation will he given.|$|E
50|$|Cryptozoa is the {{collective}} name for small animals {{who live in}} darkness and under conditions of high relative humidity, as in the wet soil underneath rocks, decomposing tree bark etc. Examples include pseudoscorpions, slugs, centipedes and earwigs. The habitat of the cryptozoa allows avoidance of fluctuations of temperature and humidity, which makes the contained range of considerably different species quite remarkable. Moreover, cryptozoa are notable for their inclusion of often <b>unnamed</b> <b>varieties</b> of organisms.|$|E

40|$|Rickenellla swartzii (Fr.) Kuyp., comb. nov. — Agaricus swartzii Fr., Obs. mycol. 1 : 90. 1815 (basionym). This {{species has}} been known thus far as Rickenella setipes (Fr. : Fr.) Raithelhuber. However, the {{original}} diagnosis of Agaricus setipes (Fries, 1818 : 162) clearly refers to another species, as A. setipes was characterized as follows: pileus 5 — 8 mm broad, campanulato-convex; stipe very long, 85 — 100 mm, setaceous; lamellae greyish; strongly resembling Agaricus corticola Pers. : Fr. As far as I can ascertain this protologue refers to a species of Mycena. The misapplication of the name Agaricus setipes might have arisen when Fries (1873 : pl. 75 f. 4) published an illustration of an <b>unnamed</b> <b>variety</b> of A. setipes, which undoubtedly represents Rickenella swartzii.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, {{researchers}} at University of California, Davis showed that Merlot is an offspring of Cabernet Franc {{and is a}} half-sibling of Carménère, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon. The identity of the second parent of Merlot wouldn't be discovered till the late 2000s when an obscure and <b>unnamed</b> <b>variety,</b> first sampled in 1996 from vines growing in an abandoned vineyard in Saint-Suliac in Brittany, was shown by DNA analysis to be the mother of Merlot.|$|R
2500|$|Some ampelographers (such as Hermann Goethe in his 1887 {{handbook}} of ampelography) have long assumed that Grüner Veltliner {{is not related}} to the other varieties with [...] "Veltliner" [...] in their name (such as Roter Veltliner), or that it is only distantly related. A first DNA analysis in the late 1990s secured Traminer as one parent of Grüner Veltliner, but was not able to identify the other parent among the candidates studied. The other parent was later found to be an originally <b>unnamed</b> <b>variety</b> of which only a single, abandoned, very old and weakened vine was found in Sankt Georgen am Leithagebirge outside Eisenstadt in Austria. The grape is therefore referred to as St. Georgener-Rebe or [...] "St. Georgen-vine".|$|R
500|$|The second video, {{created to}} {{accompany}} the 1992 single release that was recorded at Sound City Studios, was directed by Kevin Kerslake, who had previously directed the band's videos for [...] "Come as You Are" [...] and [...] "Lithium". Cobain's original concept for the video {{told the story of}} a young girl born into a Ku Klux Klan family who one day realizes how evil they are. His concept was too ambitious, so Cobain instead decided to parody musical performances by bands on early 1960s variety shows, such as The Ed Sullivan Show. The humorous tone of the video was a result of Cobain being [...] "so tired for the last year of people taking us so seriously [...] [...] [...] I wanted to fuck off and show them that we have a humorous side to us". Kerslake filmed the video on old Kinescope cameras, and the band improvised its performance. The video begins with an <b>unnamed</b> <b>variety</b> show host (played by Doug Llewelyn, former host of The People's Court) introducing Nirvana to an in-studio crowd of screaming teenagers; their non-stop screaming is heard throughout the duration of the song. The band members, whom the host refers to as [...] "thoroughly all right and decent fellas", perform dressed in Beach Boys-style outfits; Cobain wears glasses that blurred his vision, while Novoselic cut his hair short and liked it so much he kept it that way afterwards. As the video progresses, the band destroys the set and its instruments.|$|R

40|$|The {{variability}} {{in the level of}} the non-peroxide antibacterial component (UMF®) of mānuka honey produced in New Zealand was studied. A field analysis confirmed considerable variability existed in the honeys, and a number of hypotheses to explain this variability were proposed and examined. Nectar derived from Leptospermum scoparium (mānuka), was confirmed to be the source of UMF®. The dilution of mānuka honey with nectar derived from other floral sources was found to proportionally reduce the UMF® in monofloral mānuka honey. The utilisation of the thixotropic properties of mānuka honey allowed the degree of dilution in the field samples to be established, and an adjustment of the field results to account for the dilution of UMF® by other honey types revealed all monofloral mānuka honey contains UMF®. However, in the monofloral mānuka honey, significantly different levels of UMF® activity were found to come from reasonably well-defined geographic regions. The cause of the variable levels of UMF® activity in mānuka honey would appear to be the different varieties of L. scoparium being harvested by the honeybees, and the environmental parameters influencing nectar production or another species interacting with L. scoparium do not appear to influence UMF® activity. Three methods were used to establish genetic variability within regions of the North Island of New Zealand that gave rise to the various levels of UMF® activity. Analyses of morphological characteristics, chemotaxonomic essential oil profiles, and population genetics of L. scoparium populations were conducted, and the conclusions that were drawn from each of these were very similar. Two major divisions were identified, each divided into two varieties. The northern division, which contained the core populations from Northland and Waikato, represented the previously described L. scoparium var. incanum and L. scoparium var. linifolium. This division yielded mānuka honey with high UMF® activity. The southern division, which contained the core populations from the Central North Island and East Coast, represented the previously described L. scoparium var. myrtifolium and an <b>unnamed</b> <b>variety.</b> The latter, growing principally on the East Coast, uniquely contains triketones essential oils. The southern division yielded mānuka honey with low UMF® activity. Hybridisation between these varieties will occur, leading to a continuum of UMF® activity in mānuka honey. The data indicated multiple dispersions of L. scoparium to New Zealand from the evolutionary centre of the persistent-capsule Leptospermum group in south-east Australia, and later regional dispersal in New Zealand. From this study two hypotheses were accepted: the {{variability in}} the UMF® activity of mānuka honey is due to both the dilution of mānuka honey by other honey types and the variety of L. scoparium harvested...|$|R
40|$|QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI ASSOCIATED WITH LODGING, STEM STRENGTH, YIELD, AND OTHER IMPORTANT AGRONOMIC TRAITS IN DRY FIELD PEAS By Jamin Smitchger and Norman Weeden In pea, lodging changes canopy structure, {{increases}} disease pressure, reduces yield, {{and reduces}} harvest efficiency. In order {{to discover the}} quantitative trait loci (QTLs) influencing lodging resistance and other important agronomic traits in pea, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population was created from a relatively wide cross between the commercial variety Delta and an <b>unnamed</b> pea <b>variety.</b> The RIL population was grown for 6 site-years in Bozeman and Moccasin, MT, USA, and phenotypic data was collected for 22 quantitative morphological traits and seven categorical traits which {{were thought to be}} associated with lodging resistance. Genotypic data was derived from genotype by sequencing, microsattelite markers, and cleaved amplified sequence tagged sites. QTL analysis identified a total of 135 putative QTLs for the 22 traits examined in the study. There were 12 specific regions where 115 QTLs co-located, indicating that as few as 12 genes may be responsible for multiple pleiotropic effects. Ten QTLs were found for lodging resistance. Due to the large amount of phenotypic data collected, the putative mechanism of lodging resistance was determined for each QTL. In nearly every case, lodging resistance was associated with reduced plant height, a change in tendril number, or increased stem strength. This conclusion was supported by mathematical modeling. Branch number, which determines the number of tendrils per plant, was also positively associated with lodging resistance during all site-years, indicating that increasing tendril number also increases lodging resistance. Yield was controlled by eight QTLs. All QTLs for yield had pleiotropic effects on lodging resistance and yield per plant. Seed size was not correlated with yield, and a model was created which explained why no association between yield and seed size was found...|$|R
