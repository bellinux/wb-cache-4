50|$|It {{took four}} years to “refine” the Nazi art criteria; in the end what was tolerated was {{whatever}} Hitler liked, and whatever was most useful to the German government {{from the point of}} view of creating propaganda. A thorough head-hunting of artists within Germany was in effect from the beginning of the Second World War, which included the elimination of countless members within the art community. Museum directors that supported modern art were attacked; artists that refused to comply with Reich-approved art were forbidden to practice art altogether. To enforce the prohibition of practicing art, agents of the Gestapo routinely made <b>unexpected</b> <b>visits</b> to artist’s homes and studios. Wet brushes found during the inspections or even the smell of turpentine in the air was reason enough for arrest. In response to the oppressive restrictions, many artists chose to flee Germany.|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{how much time}} was taken by unplanned activities within a home dialysis training centre.

Method: This study was a quality improvement project conducted over a four-week period. Data was collected during thisperiod and included the number of telephone calls and <b>unexpected</b> <b>visits</b> from home dialysis patients into the home dialysistraining unit. Results: Findings from the study reported a total of approximately 24. 5 hours of staff time was taken for unplanned activitiesduring the four-week period of data collection. The unplanned activities included: technical troubleshooting; issues around fluidmanagement; medication prescriptions; and monthly blood forms. Conclusion: Unplanned activities take {{a substantial amount of}} staff time and there are a range of potential changes to workpractices that may assist in minimising this unplanned activity. Reducing unplanned activity time would allow more time forteaching patients the home dialysis procedure, resulting in reduced training times...|$|R

40|$|We discuss {{four key}} types of work interruptions-intrusions, breaks, distractions, and discrepancies-having {{different}} causes and consequences, and we delineate the principle features {{of each and}} specify when each kind of interruption {{is likely to have}} positive or negative consequences for the person being interrupted. By discussing in detail the multiple kinds of interruptions and their potential for positive or negative consequences, we provide a means for organizational scholars to treat interruptions and their consequences in more discriminating ways. Management scholars and practitioners generally define interruptions as incidents or occurrences that impede or delay organizational members as they attempt to make progress on work tasks. Therefore, they typically think of interruptions as disruptive for organizational members. Grove, for example, describes the <b>unexpected</b> <b>visits</b> that managers experience routinely as "the plague of managerial work " (1983 : 67). Similarly, Perlow (1999) proposes that the frequent coworker interruptions experienced by software engineers lead to "a time famine" wherein the engineers are plagued by the sense of having more job responsibilities than the time in which to do them. Even the way organization members typically define interruptions (e. g., as something that breaks continuity [Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary]) has negative undertones. Such negative perceptions notwithstanding, interruptions are ubiquitous in organizational life, and they occur frequently, {{in a variety of ways}} and forms. For example, unexpected meetings and conversations throughout the day interrupt the work patterns of managers, thwarting opportunities for extended, isolated period...|$|R

30|$|Sexuality strikes consonance {{both with}} the {{language}} of romantic presence and with {{the hole in the}} text both empty and pregnant with immense meaning. Lucy Lurie fills this space while engendering its emptiness. Lucy is projected as a lesbian family alone in the absence of her lover (variously named Helen and Grace). The <b>unexpected</b> violence <b>visited</b> upon her creates grievous ripples in her life. The non-phallic sexuality that Lucy chooses is threatened and is “usurped upon,” the phrase Lurie uses in Disgrace (22). Lucy is deliberately drawn back into the phallic system where in she consents to marry her “neighbor,” the aspiring land owner Petrus, who symbolizes the patriarchal forces gaining power in post-Apartheid South African society. Lucy is thus abducted from the non-phallic radical sexuality into a neo-masculanist patriarchal society.|$|R
