5|$|During dialogue, diction is {{dependent}} on the character's social background: Sumardjo writes that Marsiti speaks as a poor villager with little education would, and that Aij Tjeng's father and father-in-law use constructions and give advice only plausible if coming from older people. He finds only one character, the Columbia University-educated Bian Koen, to be unrealistic: Sumardjo criticises Bian Koen's emotionality, considering it <b>unfitting</b> of an individual with the character's education and life experiences. In other instances Kwee builds suspense by extended use of ellipses, a form which Sumardjo suggests was inspired by contemporary silat (traditional martial arts) stories.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{thought the}} {{enhancements}} {{made to the}} gamepad control scheme were smart and welcomed additions like controls groups. However, in some cases reviewers still regarded the gamepad as a suboptimal control method, {{largely due to the}} nature of analog sticks being imprecise in comparison to a mouse. This led to some frustration among several writers as they were unable to avoid enemy attacks because maneuvering units was slow with a gamepad. While the mouse and keyboard controls were seen as superior for performing precise actions quickly, some reviewers considered the control method to be unpolished and believed that concessions had been made for the gamepad. The unresponsive minimap, unintuitive default keybindings, and <b>unfitting</b> radial menus were highlighted as problems with the mouse and keyboard controls.|$|E
25|$|An {{unclassified}} document {{revealed that}} Solberg {{and the government}} considered that extracting Vanunu from Israel {{might be seen as}} an action against Israel and thereby <b>unfitting</b> the Norwegian government's traditional role as a friend of Israel and as a political player in the Middle East. Since the information has been revealed, Solberg has rejected criticism and defended her decision.|$|E
25|$|Subaru's {{character}} has received positive critical response by publication from manga and anime {{ever since his}} introduction in Tokyo Babylon. Anime News Network listed him as the best anime exorcist based on the cases he deals with across the series. Mike Dungan from Mania Entertainment noted that Subaru's relationship with Seishiro carried nods to Clamp's doujinshi fan-base. While reviewing the Tokyo Babylon OVAs, Chris Beveridge from the same site found Subaru's portrayal interesting and recommended it to X fans to explore the character more. On the other hand, Stig Hogset from THEM Anime Reviews criticized Subaru for being <b>unfitting</b> for his job due to his quiet personality.|$|E
25|$|On 29 December Josipović gave {{a speech}} on an SDP {{convention}} held in Rijeka where he said that with the following presidential election the political map of Croatia would change forever and that by the next parliamentary election Croatia would be colored red, referring to his party's official colour being red. Bandić did not waste time {{and the next day}} attacked Josipović arguing that the next president should not be biased once again repeating his claim that Josipović {{is nothing more than a}} pawn of Zoran Milanović who would work in his benefit if he should win. The prime minister Jadranka Kosor also criticized Josipović's remarks as <b>unfitting.</b>|$|E
25|$|Orlok is a {{fugitive}} on a distant planet, where he learns that a ten billion credit reward {{for the killing}} or kidnapping of Judge Dredd has been advertised by the Government-in-exile of East-Meg One, a band of ex-diplomats and others who survived the thermonuclear destruction of that city by Dredd's hand in 2104. Although {{not interested in the}} reward, he considers it <b>unfitting</b> that Dredd should be killed by anyone but himself, and heads for Earth. Arriving in Mega-City One, he is detected by Anderson, who tries to dissuade him from killing Dredd. Too late, she realises that Orlok has not changed as much as she thought, and she tries to arrest him, but Orlok overcomes her and takes her prisoner.|$|E
25|$|If any brother, being {{priest or}} deacon or {{of any other}} {{clerical}} order, shall commit any offense, and this shall come to {{the knowledge of the}} Prior or the Master, the brethren whom the Prior shall select for the court shall judge with righteous judgment and shall impose a penance of seven days or even of forty according to the gravity of the fault, just {{as in the case of}} other brethren who are not in holy orders. For, seeing that we are all of one religion and all, both clergy and laymen, make the same profession, it seems <b>unfitting</b> that there should be any distinction between brethren within the Hospital. Wherefore it is ordered that, as we live under one rule, so also we ought to be subject to the same judges of the rule.|$|E
25|$|The {{most direct}} attack by Bandić on Josipović {{came at the}} very end of the first debate when he accused him of {{damaging}} the city of Zagreb in 1998 by allegedly abusing his position as the head of the oversight board of a savings bank Zlatica to make a series of financial maneuvers that enabled him to collect his deposit of 138,000 Deutsche Marks from the bank Komercijalna banka that had been blocked and later went bankrupt. Bandić cited a court ruling from 2006 that had invalidated those maneuvers. Josipović defended himself saying that was merely a civil case which he was not even a part of and that he did not commit any illegal actions. Josipović also had to defend his damaging quotation that Croatia would be coloured red by the next election, saying that it was only natural for a political party to be ambitious saying he does not consider the remarks to be <b>unfitting</b> repeating once again that, if elected, he would be the president of all citizens.|$|E
500|$|On June 12, 2009, FIU's Board of Trustees voted {{unanimously}} to rename the University Park campus to the Modesto Maidique Campus. However, the change created a large backlash from the FIU community, as many felt it <b>unfitting</b> to name the campus after him. A campaign by FIU students and alumni was created to revert the name change, {{and to keep the}} name University Park. A Facebook group, [...] "No to Maidique's Campus" [...] with over 2,000 supporters has made national news, in many newspapers, TV news stations, and collegiate magazines, supporting to keep the name [...] "University Park".|$|E
500|$|In its 1994 review, GamePro rated Hotel Marios {{graphics}} at 3.5 {{and sound}} at 4 out of 5, citing that [...] "the only intriguing {{aspects of this}} game are the well-fashioned animated sequences." [...] Years after the game was released, the cut scenes have become a subject of criticism among video game websites, and were called [...] "outright terrifying" [...] by 1UP.com. IGN described them as [...] "abysmal" [...] and [...] "a bad flip-book of images printed out of Microsoft Paint. From 1987." [...] The quality of the voice acting was also questioned. Both 1UP.com and IGN thought the voices were <b>unfitting</b> for the characters and did not achieve the same playfulness as those of Mario and Luigi's current voice artist Charles Martinet. Hotel Mario was listed in the Top 10 Worst Mario Games of all time, and as the #1 worst Mario game by ScrewAttack's Top Ten Worst Mario Games.|$|E
500|$|Final Fantasy Versus XIII {{was created}} {{as part of}} Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy, a {{subseries}} within the Final Fantasy franchise featuring games linked by a common mythos which included Final Fantasy XIII and Type-0: apart from the mythos, they are completely separate, and each game's staff are able to interpret the mythos for each game. Versus XIII {{was one of the}} original titles created for the subseries alongside Final Fantasy XIII, forming the core of the series around which future titles would evolve. Nomura intended Versus XIII to be a heavy departure from his lighthearted Kingdom Hearts series. He attributed this move to his [...] "love for extremes" [...] and explained the direction he took as closer to his personal taste and completely different from what producers had requested him to do in the past. Early in development, Nomura said that the concept and thinking behind the game was <b>unfitting</b> for a regular numbered Final Fantasy installment, thus explaining its original status as a spin-off. His role as director of Versus XIII, in addition to other projects, was a move made following the departure of series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi from the company.|$|E
500|$|For Sony's OVAs of the franchise, {{there have}} also been {{multiple}} response. Matthew Anderson from DVD Vision Japan found the series' title [...] "Samurai X" [...] <b>unfitting</b> for Kenshin as the reviewer regarded the character as a hired killer rather than as a samurai as seen across the prequel OVAs. Rio Yañez from Animerica said one of the major themes of Trust is understanding the repercussions and after-effects murder can have, something that Kenshin has yet to comprehend though others have tried to point it out to him. Mike Crando from Anime News Network highly enjoyed Kenshin's characterization in the prequel as he refers it as [...] "it is a fascinating and emotional character study in its own right" [...] due to Kenshin's character development across these four episodes from [...] "an idealistic youth to a cold-hearted killer, only to be redeemed through love lost and the realization that swinging his sword is destroying his own life as well as {{the lives of the people}} on the receiving end". Additionally, the reviewer enjoyed the OVA's director's cut for showing more fights between Kenshin and Shinsenguimi, the special forces where Saito originated from. Earl Cressey from DVD Talk found Kenshin as a [...] "complex" [...] character and said his relationship with Yukishiro Tomoe might appeal the viewers. Carlos Ross from THEM Anime Reviews shared similar feelings and enjoyed the romance between Kenshin Tomoe despite its tragic outcome. Yegulalp from ThoughtCo. also listed the series as one of the [...] "Best anime romances" [...] with a bigger focus on Kenshin and Tomoe.|$|E
500|$|Similar to New Super Mario Bros., {{the game}} was {{developed}} with the intention to invoke nostalgic feelings in players with its art style and sound, while trying {{to provide them with}} new gameplay experiences. Retro tried to make the game [...] "accessible to all players", but with a [...] "kind of difficulty that made players want to try it again". The game employs fully polygonal 3D graphics with levels containing three times the amount of textures and polygons that Retro's [...] offered in a single room. Though Miyamoto initially opposed the idea, simultaneous two-player gameplay was eventually implemented, contrary to the tag-team system of the original series. Tanabe said a partial inspiration for the feature was to make Returns [...] "stand out" [...] compared to the New Play Control! re-release of Donkey Kong Jungle Beat. Over the course of six months, two-thirds of the game's tools and engine had to be rewritten by the programmers, the animation and collision systems being subject to the most changes, and while experiments were conducted with underwater levels, they were ultimately omitted as they felt too slow and <b>unfitting</b> to the overall gameplay. Two levels in the game, [...] "Tidal Terror" [...] and [...] "Mangoruby Run", proved to be the most difficult levels to design and program, each requiring several months of development time. In Returns, Retro tried to use the same camera engine used for the Morph Ball in Metroid Prime, but found it unable to handle the quick and complex movements of the characters, particularly after the implementation of two-player gameplay.|$|E
500|$|Usher {{made his}} {{television}} acting debut on the American sitcom Moesha in 1997 playing Jeremy Davis, the love interest and classmate Moesha played by Brandy Norwood. He has acted in feature films, debuting in 1998's The Faculty. In 1999 Usher {{appeared as a}} student disc jockey in the teen romantic comedy film She's All That. The same year he starred in his first {{leading role in the}} movie Light It Up with Rosario Dawson, Vanessa L. Williams and Forest Whitaker. The following year, he played in Gepetto and Texas Rangers. He starred in the 2002 Twilight Zone revival episode To Protect and Serve as a police officer. Usher continued to make appearances in various television shows, including the period drama American Dreams (2002) in the role of Marvin Gaye. He also appeared in Sabrina the Teenage Witch in Season 2, episode 6 playing the role of a love doctor. In 2005, he starred in the crime-comedy film In The Mix with Chazz Palminteri and Kevin Hart. He has acted on stage, making his debut on Broadway in 2006 in Chicago as lawyer Billy Flynn and joining the cast of the Off-Broadway play Fuerzabruta in 2012; the former performance was critiqued by theater critic Ben Brantley as <b>unfitting</b> for the character played stating [...] "Usher was [...] "cast so hard against type, you would think you would hear him cracking from the collision", despite commending his vocal and choreographic performance in the show. In 2013, he began filming his role as boxer Sugar Ray Leonard for the 2016 American biographical film Hands of Stone, which follows the life of Panamanian boxer Roberto Durán. In the film he stars alongside Édgar Ramírez, Robert De Niro, Ellen Barkin and Ana de Armas.

2500|$|In late 2005, Heap {{was asked}} to write a track for the [...] of [...] {{entitled}} [...] "Can't Take It In", when a track that fellow Brit singer Dido submitted was deemed <b>unfitting.</b> Heap's track is played {{at the end of}} the film in an orchestral version produced by Heap and Harry Gregson Williams, who scored the movie. In addition, she composed a track for the film , but it was deemed to be too dark in tone for the film. Instead, it was included in her album Ellipse as [...] "2-1". 2-1 has also featured in CSI Miami (Season 8 Episode 9), as well as promotional trailers for the film The Lovely Bones.|$|E
2500|$|Down-to-earth-aspects in Africanus' {{descriptions}} {{were largely}} ignored and stories of great riches {{served as a}} catalyst for travellers to visit the inaccessible city – with prominent French explorer René Caillié characterising Timbuktu as [...] "a mass of ill-looking houses built of earth". Now opened up, many travellers acknowledged the <b>unfitting</b> description of an [...] "African El Dorado". This development shifted the city's reputation – from being fabled because of its gold to fabled because of its location and mystery: Being used in this sense since at least 1863, English dictionaries now cite Timbuktu as a metaphor for any faraway place. Long part of colloquial language, Timbuktu also found its way into literature: in Tom Robbins' novel Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas, Timbuktu provides a central theme. One lead character, Larry Diamond, is vocally fascinated with the city.|$|E
2500|$|While {{teaching}} in Hightstown, Clara Barton {{learned about the}} lack of public schools in Bordentown, the neighboring city. In 1852, she was contracted to open a free school in Bordentown, which was the first ever free school in New Jersey. She was successful, and after a year she had hired another woman to help teach over 600 people. Both women were making $250 a year. This accomplishment compelled the town to raise nearly $4,000 for a new school building. Once completed, though, Barton was replaced as principal by a man elected by the school board. They saw the position as head of a large institution to be <b>unfitting</b> for a woman. She was demoted to [...] "female assistant" [...] and worked in a harsh environment until she had a nervous breakdown along with other health ailments, and quit.|$|E
2500|$|Keenly {{interested}} in botany, she was {{closely associated with}} the Lichfield Botanical Society (despite the name, composed of only three men, Erasmus Darwin, Sir Brooke Boothby and John Jackson) and published as did the preceding members, anonymously under the name of the Society. Encouraged by Darwin she firmly rejected the conservative backlash to the revelations of Carl Linnaeus' sexual system of plant classification. This was considered <b>unfitting</b> for ladies, whose modesty had to be protected. [...] "I had heard it was not fit for the female eye. It can only be unfit for the perusal of such females as still believe the legend of their nursery that children are dug out of a parsley-bed; who have never been at church, or looked into a Bible, -and are totally ignorant that in the present state of the world, two sexes are necessary to the production of animals." ...|$|E
2500|$|Minstrels and folk-singers reciting heroic {{songs were}} {{well-known}} {{figures of the}} age of Anonymus. He explicitly referred to [...] "the gabbling rhymes of mistrels and the spurious tales of peasants who have not forgotten the brave deeds and wars of the Hungarians" [...] even to his time. However, he did not conceal his scorn for oral tradition, stating that it [...] "would be most unworthy and completely <b>unfitting</b> for the so most noble people of Hungary to hear as if in sleep of the beginning of their kind and of their bravery and deeds from the false stories of peasants and the gabbling song of minstrels". All the same, stylistic elements (including formulaic repetitions which can be found in his text) imply that he occasionally utilized heroic songs. According to Kristó, the legend of Emese's dream of the [...] "falcon that seemed to come to her and impregnate her" [...] was one of the motifs that Anonymus borrowed from oral tradition.|$|E
