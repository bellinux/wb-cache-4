5|$|According to {{traditional}} sources Aisha was {{six or seven}} years old when betrothed to Muhammad, with the marriage not being consummated <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> reached puberty at the age of nine or ten years old. She was therefore a virgin at marriage. Modern Muslim authors who calculate Aisha's age based on other sources of information, such that available about her sister Asma about whom more is known, estimate that she was over thirteen and perhaps in her late teens {{at the time of her}} marriage.|$|E
5|$|These 7.5cm (3in) long {{chandelier}} earrings made by Cartier in 1929 {{have three}} large drops adorned with every modern cut of diamond. The earrings were purchased by Margaret Greville, who left {{them to her}} friend the Queen Mother in 1942, and Elizabeth's parents gave them to her in 1947 as a wedding present. However, she {{was not able to}} use them <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> her ears pierced. When the public noticed that her ears had been pierced, doctors and jewellers found themselves inundated with requests by women anxious to have their ears pierced too.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scenes in}} the episode were cut prior to broadcast. The opening scene in Jerry's car, in which George {{discusses}} breaking up with Marlene, originally had George proposing that he would stage his own kidnapping while {{walking down the street}} with Marlene, and then hide out <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> given up on him. Although it was cut before the episode's broadcast, this scene was included on the Seinfeld Volume 1 DVD set. Another scene which was cut featured Jerry's neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards) entering Jerry's apartment carrying a plate with cantaloupe on toothpicks. Originally, the scene in which Jerry tells George that he is dating Marlene took place in a library, with a librarian repeatedly shushing George and Jerry and kicking them out of the library {{at the end of the}} scene. The location was changed to Monk's Cafe because the dialogue had nothing to do with a library.|$|E

25|$|The {{sacrifice}} {{of a bear}} for Artemis started with the Brauron cult. Every year a girl between five and ten years of age was sent to Artemis' temple at Brauron. The Byzantine writer Suidos relayed the legend in Arktos e Brauroniois. A bear was tamed by Artemis and introduced {{to the people of}} Athens. They touched it and played with it until one day a group of girls poked the bear until it attacked them. A brother of one of the girls killed the bear, so Artemis sent a plague in revenge. The Athenians consulted an oracle to understand how to end the plague. The oracle suggested that, in payment for the bear's blood, no Athenian virgin should be allowed to marry <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> served Artemis in her temple ('played the bear for the goddess').|$|E

25|$|After {{this major}} defeat, Charles of Lorraine {{was removed from}} his command and {{replaced}} by Daun, who was now promoted to Field Marshal. Frederick hoped the major victories at Rossbach and Leuthen would bring Maria Theresa to the peace table, but she {{was determined not to}} negotiate <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> retaken Silesia. With the Saxon–Silesian front stabilized, Frederick ordered the bulk of his East Prussian forces under Marshal Lehwaldt to reinforce Pomerania, predicting that no new Russian advance would come until the spring. The enlarged Prussian army quickly drove the Swedes back, occupied most of Swedish Pomerania, and blockaded its capital at Stralsund through the winter. Over the winter, Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick, now commander of Hanover's army, launched a series of offensives that drove the French out of northern Germany and across the Rhine, securing Prussia's western flank {{for the duration of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|From {{the time}} of Genie's {{admission}} doctors saw clearly picked up some nonverbal information, with Kent emphasizing that she seemed very intent on looking at peoples' faces and made decent eye contact from other people, and she showed {{a small amount of}} responsiveness to it {{even in the absence of}} language. Despite this, Kent noted that she could only get across a few very basic needs and neither made facial expressions nor used any discernible body language. When Genie was upset she would engage in silent, expressionless, self-harming tantrums <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> physically tired herself out, after which she immediately reverted to being completely non-expressive. She never cried during these outbursts—according to several firsthand accounts she could not cry at all—and if she wanted to make noise she pushed chairs or other objects. On a few occasions she responded to stimuli with a very soft, high-pitched, shrill laugh, but was otherwise completely undemonstrative.|$|E

He married actress (and Miss Rheingold of 1958) Madelyn Darrow twice; they had three children including twin girls, she currently lives in Fountain Valley. He married his dental hygienist, Betty, in Beverly Hills and had one daughter. His last wife, Rita, is the sister of Andre Agassi, and they had two children. According to Price's article, Rita's father, Mike Agassi, a 1952 Olympian on the Iranian boxing team who had become a successful casino greeter in Las Vegas, hated Gonzales {{so much that he}} considered having him killed. Gonzales had coached the young Rita <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> rebelled against her father's 5,000-balls-a-day-regimen and first moved in with, then married, on March 31, 1984, the much older Gonzales. Years before, Mike Agassi, already a tennis fanatic, had once served as a linesman for one of Gonzales's professional matches in Chicago. Gonzales had upbraided Agassi so severely for perceived miscalls that Agassi had walked away and gone to sit in the stands.|$|E

Her father, Francesco Cardinale, was a railway worker, born in Gela, Sicily. [...] Her native languages were French, Tunisian Arabic, and the Sicilian language of her parents. She did not learn to speak Italian <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> already begun to be cast for Italian films.|$|E

She {{was attached to the}} Mediterranean Fleet following the outbreak of the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. When the Spanish Civil War broke out, Hood was officially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to return to Britain in 1939 for an overhaul. By this time, advances in naval gunnery had reduced Hoods usefulness. She was scheduled to undergo a major rebuild in 1941 to correct these issues, but the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 forced the ship into service without the upgrades.|$|E

500|$|Cathy Davey {{first came}} to be known as a backing vocalist {{alongside}} Carol Keogh for Ken McHugh's project Autamata. McHugh and Davey subsequently collaborated on what Hot Press described as [...] "a mixture of otherworldly indie and soft space age melodica". Davey signed to EMI/Parlophone in 2003 in a deal which Hot Press later described as having [...] "eclipsed even the high-profile signing of The Thrills". Her rise had been low-profile; she did not perform live <b>until</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> signed her record deal. Her four-track debut EP, [...] "Come Over", released in 2004, and in which she [...] "swoops and yelps her way through proceedings with her distinctive voice", was described by the magazine as [...] "inviting comparisons with others before deciding that she'd rather be completely unique if it's all the same with you".|$|E
500|$|After 1945, {{stories of}} the Lalaurie slaves became {{considerably}} more explicit.

Intestines were pulled out and knotted around naked waists. There were holes in skulls, where a rough stick had been inserted to stir the brains." [...] DeLavigne did not directly cite any sources for these claims, and they were not supported by the primary sources.|$|E

She assured him that publishing was as foreign to her [...] "as Firmament to Fin", but also proposed that [...] "If fame belonged to me, I could not escape her". Dickinson delighted in dramatic self-characterization and mystery in her letters to Higginson. She said of herself, [...] "I am small, like the wren, and my hair is bold, like the chestnut bur, and my eyes like the sherry in the glass that the guest leaves." [...] She stressed her solitary nature, stating that her only real companions were the hills, the sundown, and her dog, Carlo. She also mentioned that whereas her mother did not [...] "care for Thought", her father bought her books, but begged her [...] "not to read them– because he fears they joggle the Mind".|$|E
