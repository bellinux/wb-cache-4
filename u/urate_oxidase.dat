500|$|Gout is a {{disorder}} of purine metabolism, and occurs when its final metabolite, uric acid, crystallizes {{in the form}} of monosodium urate, precipitating and forming deposits (tophi) in joints, on tendons and in the surrounding tissues. Microscopic tophi may be walled off by a ring of proteins, which blocks interaction of the crystals with cells and therefore avoids inflammation. Naked crystals may break out of walled-off tophi due to minor physical damage to the joint, medical or surgical stress, or rapid changes in uric acid levels. When they break through the tophi, they trigger a local immune-mediated inflammatory reaction in macrophages, which is initiated by the NLRP3 inflammasome protein complex.

40|$|Bacteria that {{associate}} with living hosts require intricate mechanisms {{to detect and}} respond to host defenses. Part of the early host defense against invading bacteria is the production of reactive oxygen species, and xanthine oxidase {{is one of the}} main producers of such agents. The end-product of the enzymatic activity of xanthine <b>oxidase,</b> <b>urate,</b> was previously shown to be the natural ligand for Deinococcus radiodurans-encoded HucR and it was shown to attenuate DNA binding by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-encoded PecS and Burkholderia thailandensis-encoded MftR, all members of the multiple antibiotic resistance regulator (MarR) family. We here show that residues involved in binding urate and eliciting the DNA binding antagonism are conserved in a specific subset of MarR homologs. Although HucR controls endogenous urate levels by regulating a uricase gene, almost all other homologs are predicted to respond to exogenous urate levels and to regulate a transmembrane transport protein belonging to either the drug metabolite transporter (DMT) or the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), as further evidenced by the presence of conserved binding sites for the cognate transcription factor within the respective promoter regions. These data suggest the use of orthologous genes for different regulatory purposes.

5000|$|Serendipity {{followed}} de Duve {{for another}} major discovery. After confirmation of lysosome, de Duve's team {{was troubled by}} the existence of another enzyme <b>urate</b> <b>oxidase</b> in rat liver cell fraction. He was convinced {{that it did not}} belong to lysosome because it is not an acid hydrolase, typical of lysosomal enzymes, but still had similar distribution as acid phosphatase. In 1960 he further found that other enzymes such as catalase and D-amino acid oxidase were similarly distributed in cell fraction, and they were believed to be mitochondrial enzymes. (W. Bernhard and C. Rouillier had described such extra-mitochodrial organelles as microbodies, and believed that they were precursors to mitochondria.) de Duve discovered that these three enzymes exhibited similar chemical properties and were similar to those of other peroxide-producing oxidases. He was sceptical of referring to them as microbodies because, as he noted, [...] "too little is known of their enzyme complement and of their role in the physiology of the liver cells to substantiate a proposal at the present time". He suggested that these enzymes belonged to the same cell organelle, but different from previously known organelles. But it would take some years before he publicised his hypothesis, as strong evidences were still lacking. In 1955 his team demonstrated similar cell fractions with same biochemical properties from the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena pyriformis, from which it was indicated that these particles were new cell organelles unrelated to mitochondria. He presented his discovery {{at a meeting of the}} American Society for Cell Biology in 1955, and formally published in 1966 in which he created the name peroxisomes for the organelles as they are involved in peroxidase reactions. In 1968 he achieved the first large-scale preparation of peroxisomes, confirming that l-α hydroxyacid oxidase, d-amino acid oxidase, and catalase were all the unique enzymes of peroxisomes. de Duve and his team went on to show that peroxisomes play important metabolic roles, including the β-oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids by a pathway different from that in mitochondria, and that they are members of a large family of evolutionarily related organelles present in diverse cells including plants, and protozoa, where they carry out distinct functions and have been given specific names, such as glyoxysomes and glycosomes.|$|E

Screening of liver homogenates from rats at different developmental stages using immunoblot analysis demonstrated low levels of <b>urate</b> <b>oxidase</b> prior to 20 days of age; at 20 days of age, <b>urate</b> <b>oxidase</b> levels are 2 -fold greater than the 15 -day old levels and approximate adult levels. Catalase expression during rat development mimicked the differential expression pattern of <b>urate</b> <b>oxidase.</b> The increase between days 15 and 20 was determined to be independent of the process of weaning.

40|$|<b>Urate</b> <b>oxidase,</b> or uricase (EC 1. 7. 3. 3), is a peroxisomal {{enzyme that}} catalyzes the {{oxidation}} of uric acid to allantoin in most mammals.

To identify the molecular basis for this loss, <b>urate</b> <b>oxidase</b> cDNA clones were isolated from pig, mouse, and baboon, and their DNA sequences were determined. The mouse <b>urate</b> <b>oxidase</b> open reading frame encodes a 303 -amino acid polypeptide, while the pig and baboon <b>urate</b> <b>oxidase</b> cDNAs encode a 304 -amino acid polypeptide due to a single codon deletion/insertion event.
