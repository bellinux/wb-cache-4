It additionally incorporates the proposed calculation for expectation in heterogeneous and various environments. We can develop our work via completing these investigations in a bigger domain {{and with all the}} more genuine codes including high calculations. Our future work will likewise concentrate on amplifying our proposed procedure and its usage to incorporate other programming dialects. Another critical angle is to actualize occupation booking taking into account this forecast calculation. The asset supplier is characterized as an operator that controls the asset. Work is allotted onto the most suitable asset supplier as per its necessities. Thus, asset prerequisite portrayal for a vocation is a vital assignment <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> administration. The runtime conduct of an occupation is for the most part not known previously. Along these lines, asset necessity determination characterized by the clients may prompt over-estimation or <b>under-estimation</b> <b>of</b> obliged <b>assets</b> for occupations. While underestimation frustrates execution of occupation, over-estimation prompts wastage <b>of</b> profitable <b>assets.</b> So it would be extremely helpful if the asset necessity estimation can be computerized in the lattice itself. For this, different approaches are developed and distinctive forecast modules are these days utilized {{as a part of the}} Resource Management Systems (RMS) of a lattice. Proficient asset necessity forecast arrangements additionally help to accomplish better nature of administration, due date planning, effective plate use and so forth. So looks into have been going ahead to devise exact asset prerequisite forecast strategies over the globe and it is a running issue in framework figuring today.

40|$|Many {{financial}} time-series show leptokurtic behavior, i. e., fat tails. Such tail {{behavior is}} important for risk management. In this paper I focus on the calculation of Value-at-Risk (VaR) as a downside-risk measure for optimal asset portfolios. Using a framework centered around the Student t distribution, I explicitly allow for a discrepancy between the fat-tailedness of the true distribution <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> returns {{and that of the}} distribution used by the investment manager. As a result, numbers for the over-estimation or <b>under-estimation</b> <b>of</b> the true VaR of a given portfolio can be computed. These numbers are used to rank several well-known estimation methods for determining the unknown parameters of the distribution <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> returns. Minimizing the absolute (percentage) mismatch between the nominal and actual or true VaR leads to the choice of a Gaussian maximum quasi-likelihood estimator, i. e., a least-squares type estimator. The maximum likelihood estimator has a less satisfactory behavior. Outlier robust estimators perform even worse if the required confidence level for the VaR is high. An explanation for these results is provided.

40|$|We {{estimate}} the "non-gravitational" entropy-injection profiles, Δ K, {{and the resultant}} energy feedback profiles, Δ E, of the intracluster medium for 17 clusters using their Planck SZ and ROSAT X-Ray observations, spanning a large radial range from 0. 2 r_ 500 up to r_ 200. The feedback profiles are estimated by comparing the observed entropy, at fixed gas mass shells, with theoretical entropy profiles predicted from non-radiative hydrodynamic simulations. We include non-thermal pressure and gas clumping in our analysis. The inclusion of non-thermal pressure and clumping results in changing the estimates for r_ 500 and r_ 200 by 10 %- 20 %. When clumpiness is not considered it leads to an <b>under-estimation</b> <b>of</b> Δ K≈ 300 keV cm^ 2 at r_ 500 and Δ K≈ 1100 keV cm^ 2 at r_ 200. On the other hand, neglecting non-thermal pressure results in an over-estimation of Δ K≈ 100 keV cm^ 2 at r_ 500 and <b>under-estimation</b> <b>of</b> Δ K≈ 450 keV cm^ 2 at r_ 200. For the estimated feedback energy, we find that ignoring clumping leads to an <b>under-estimation</b> <b>of</b> energy per particle Δ E≈ 1 keV at r_ 500 and Δ E≈ 1. 5 keV at r_ 200. Similarly, neglect of the non-thermal pressure results in an over-estimation of Δ E≈ 0. 5 keV at r_ 500 and <b>under-estimation</b> <b>of</b> Δ E≈ 0. 25 keV at r_ 200. We find entropy floor of Δ K≈ 300 keV cm^ 2 is ruled out at ≈ 3 σ throughout the entire radial range and Δ E≈ 1 keV at more than 3 σ beyond r_ 500, strongly constraining ICM pre-heating scenarios. We also demonstrate robustness of results w. r. t sample selection, X-Ray analysis procedures, entropy modeling etc. Comment: 17 pages, 15 figures, 5 tables, Accepted in MNRA...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAsset {{management}} {{is an increasing}} concern for the water and wastewater industry. Condition assessment of sewer segments {{is an important component}} <b>of</b> sewer <b>asset</b> management and relies mostly on visual inspection. Observed defects are translated into a score for each segment. Although most protocols give a segment a condition grade by comparing its score with a subjective scale of numerical values, we propose a protocol to calibrate thresholds for each asset stock. Thresholds are calculated according to two sets of parameters: overall condition <b>of</b> the <b>asset</b> stock in question (estimated by a representative sample or provided by the utility manager) and assignment-error weighting (determined by the utility manager) linked to either over-estimation or <b>under-estimation</b> <b>of</b> condition grade. This method is applied to 150 km of sewers from the Greater Lyon asset stock. Sensitivity analyses of these parameters are then implemented. Three hypotheses about overall condition <b>of</b> the <b>asset</b> stock are combined with three matrices of assignment-error weights. Both parameters influence thresholds and change the assessment of the studied segments. The synthesis of such sensitivity analyses can be used to prioritise complementary investigations...|$|R

By means of a case study, it is shown that the failure to reproduce the spatial correlations among stochastic precipitation records in a large watershed leads to an <b>under-estimation</b> <b>of</b> the variance of basin-wide precipitation volumes and consequently an over-estimation of water supply reliability. This in turn can lead to <b>under-estimation</b> <b>of</b> the active storage requirements for proposed reservoirs and, ultimately, water supply infrastructure that fails to deliver the design water demands at the expected reliability level.

40|$|Primary objective: To {{determine}} whether patients with stroke {{who have a}} good functional outcome show awareness of memory functioning and whether over-and <b>under-estimation</b> <b>of</b> memory performance are differentially related to neuropsychological performance. Research design: Prospective cohort study. Methods and procedures: The Barrow Neurological Institute Screen for Higher Cerebral Functions and a brief neuropsychological assessment were used to evaluate language, orientation, attention, visuospatial problem-solving, perception, reasoning, executive functioning, memory, affect and awareness of memory functioning. As for the latter, the patient's estimate of memory functioning was compared {{with his or her}} actual memory performance. Patients were divided into three groups: good-estimators (estimated performance actual performance), over-estimators (estimated performance > actual performance) and under-estimators (estimated performance < actual performance). Main outcomes and results: In total, 54 patients with stroke were included, of whom 27 patients were classified as good-estimators, 19 as over-estimators and eight as under-estimators. Compared to good-estimators, over-estimators had significantly lower scores for all cognitive domains. Under-estimators had significantly poorer affect compared to good-estimators. Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that over-and <b>under-estimation</b> <b>of</b> memory functioning can be observed in patients with stroke who have a good functional outcome and that they may reflect distinct underlying neuropsychological processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to study the e ect of under-reporting in epidemics. In particular, there are two broad questions we investigate: In the situation of under-reporting in epidemics, {{what would happen if}} the data were treated as if no under-reporting were occurring? Such assumption leads to an <b>under-estimation</b> <b>of</b> the contact rate, implying an <b>under-estimation</b> <b>of</b> the reproduction number. By allowing for the fact that under-reporting is occurring, how and how well can we estimate the reporting rate and other parameters of the model? We explore the above questions by considering the stochastic Markovian SIR epidemic in which various reporting processes are incorporated. We consider cases of constant reporting probability and move on to more realistic assumptions such as the reporting probability depending on time, the number of reported cases and the dependence on the source of infection for each infected individual. We develop various methodologies, based on temporal data, to account for underreporting in the Bayesian framework using MCMC to sample from the posterior distributions of the model parameters.

SIMDualKc applies the FAO 56 dual crop coefficient approach for computing and partitioning evapotranspiration (ET) into actual crop transpiration (Tc act) and soil evaporation (Es), while AquaCrop uses an approach {{that depends on the}} canopy cover curve. The calibration-validations of models were performed by comparing observed and predicted soil water content (SWC) and grain yield. SIMDualKc showed good accuracy for SWC estimations, with normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) 7. 6 %. AquaCrop was less accurate, with NRMSE 9. 2 %. Differences between models regarding the water balance terms were notable, and the ET partition revealed a trend for <b>under-estimation</b> <b>of</b> Tc act by AquaCrop, mainly under severe water stress. Yield predictions with SIMDualKc-Stewart models produced NRMSE < 15 % while predictions with AquaCrop resulted in NRMSE 23 % due to <b>under-estimation</b> <b>of</b> Tc act, particularly for water stressed treatments.
