40|$|The Polish {{parliamentary}} committees {{have completed}} {{work on the}} draft regulation concerning the liability of the State Treasury, local government and other legal persons for damage done during the execution of public power. These regulations are due to replace currently binding art. 417 - 421 of the Polish Civil Code. Under art. 77 section 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland this liability has been tightened, for they no longer {{are based on the}} principle of guilt. The above mentioned legal entities take liability on the principle of risk, as they are liable only for <b>unlawful</b> action or <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> act during the execution of public authority. This liability encompasses also damage done as a result of unlawful normative or individual acts and <b>unlawful</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> issue such acts...|$|R

I describe an action for <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> act, define the conditions of admissibility, compare the action for <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> act to the action for annulment and analyse {{the decisions of the}} CJEU.

40|$|Exposure to {{traumatic}} stress {{is a requirement}} {{for the development of}} post{{traumatic stress}} disorder (PTSD). However, because the majority of trauma-exposed persons do not develop PTSD, examination of the typical effects of a stressor will not identify the critical components of PTSD risk or pathogenesis. Rather, PTSD represents a specific phenotype associated with a <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> recover from the normal effects of trauma. Thus, research must focus on identifying pre- and posttraumatic risk factors that explain the development of the disorder and the <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>reinstate</b> physiological homeostasis. In this review, we summarize what is known about the clinical and biological characteristics of PTSD and articulate some of the gaps in knowledge that can be addressed by basic neuroscience research. We emphasize how knowledge about individual differences related to genetic and epigenetic factors in behavioral and brain responses to stress offers the hope of a deeper understanding of PTSD...|$|R

40|$|A {{purpose of}} my thesis was an {{analysis}} of problems with legal regulation of protection against <b>unlawful</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> act in public administration. Firstly I described institutes which should prevent illegal inactivity so I focused on regulations of time for taking a decision and other institutes, especially regulation presented by the Administrative Procedure Rules. The regulation in Administrative Procedure Rules {{caused a lot of}} questions which are nowadays answered thanks to the Highest Court of Administration and procedure according the Administrative Procedure Rules is connected with protection given by an administrative justice. In this system there is also included regulation of liability for damages caused by unlawful official procedure. The purpose of this institute is not to prevent inactivity but to compensate consequences it caused. The legislature completed this topic with a result that injured party can require (since 2006) compensation for suffering moral damage independently of property damage. We can find some positive elements of recent regulation, such as specific regulation of time for taking a decision, formulation of fundamental principles of action of administrative bodies or possibility to provide compensation of moral damages. But the regulation has imperfections too. Since basic [...] ...|$|R
