40|$|Abstract The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to examine how the personnel of the Unviversity of Oulu experienced a change in <b>print</b> <b>services.</b> The <b>print</b> <b>services</b> managed by the university were replaced with <b>print</b> <b>services</b> provided by an external service provider. The management of the university was interested to find out how satisfied the employees were with the new services, so a master’s thesis topic for studying the experiences of the personnel was announced. The service provider, Canon, was interested in the results of the research, too. Data for the study was collected with a user satisfaction questionnaire that was sent to the personnel in February 2015. The survey consisted of open ended and closed-ended questions. The research was a qualitative case study and the emphasis was on qualitative analysis of the open ended questions. The data collected from the closed questions was analysed quantitatively. The findings of the study revealed that the users were quite satisfied with the new <b>print</b> <b>services,</b> and that some of the new features were highly appreciated. However, a few relatively clear areas of dissatisfaction existed, too. This research contributed to science by adding knowledge about managed <b>print</b> <b>services,</b> and on a more detailed level, about how personnel of a university experienced a change from <b>print</b> <b>services</b> managed by the university to <b>print</b> <b>services</b> provided by an outside service provider. Also, a possible positive relationship between implementing a managed <b>print</b> <b>services</b> solution and user satisfaction was found. On a practical level the findings provided helpful information for the university and the service provider for improving the new <b>print</b> <b>services.</b> Also, this study contributed to the research of information systems success, user resistance and user satisfaction in the context of managed <b>print</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} and classify the available types of 3 D <b>printing</b> <b>services,</b> with the scope of determining the potential implications that such services could have on the supply chains of manufacturing firms and creating a research agenda for future studies. Design/methodology/approach: The authors review the current literature on the potential supply chain impacts of 3 D printing and evaluate the 3 D <b>printing</b> <b>services</b> provided by 404 firms in selected European markets. Findings: The results show that 3 D <b>printing</b> <b>services</b> form a rapidly evolving industry, with new service providers entering the market on a regular basis. Evidence from the European markets investigated suggests that services can be classified into three distinct categories: generative, facilitative and selective services. Research limitations/implications: This paper represents an attempt to take stock of a fastmoving and potentially paradigm-shifting market. The implications are dynamic as new applications, business models and techniques are continually being developed. Further studies are required to substantiate the findings. Practical implications: Three categories of 3 D <b>printing</b> <b>services</b> that could significantly impact supply chain configurations of the future are proposed. Several issues specific to 3 D <b>printing</b> <b>services</b> raised in the research agenda require further scrutiny and substantiation before services can reach their full potential. Originality/value: This paper provides an overview of the growing 3 D <b>printing</b> <b>services</b> industry, highlighting how the market might change as additive manufacturing technology matures...|$|R
