50|$|To {{recreate}} the battlefield authentically, the Soviets bulldozed away two hills, laid five miles of roads, transplanted 5,000 trees, sowed fields of rye, barley and wildflowers and reconstructed four historic buildings. To create the mud, {{more than six}} miles of <b>underground</b> <b>irrigation</b> piping was specially laid. Most of the battle scenes were filmed using five Panavision cameras simultaneously—from ground level, from 100 foot towers, from a helicopter, and from an overhead railway built right across the location.|$|R
5000|$|The Garamantes ({{possibly}} {{from the}} Berber igherman / iɣerman, meaning: [...] "cities" [...] in modern Berber; or possibly from igerramen meaning [...] "saints, holy/sacred people" [...] in modern Berber) were a Berber tribe who developed an advanced civilization in ancient southwestern Libya. They used an elaborate <b>underground</b> <b>irrigation</b> system, and founded prosperous Berber kingdoms or city-states in the Fezzan area of Libya, in the Sahara desert. They were a local power between 500 BC and 700 AD.|$|R
5000|$|Al-‘Ain's oases {{are known}} for their <b>underground</b> <b>irrigation</b> system [...] "falaj" [...] (or qanāt from Arabic قناة) that brings water from {{boreholes}} to water farms and palm trees. Falaj irrigation is an ancient system dating back thousands of years and is used widely in ‘Oman, the UAE, China, Iran and other countries. Al-‘Ain has seven oases; the largest is Al Ain Oasis, near to Old Sarooj, and the smallest is Al-Jahili Oasis. The rest are Al-Qaṭṭara, Al-Mu‘ṫaredh, Al-Jimi, Al-Muwaiji, and Al-Hili.|$|R
25|$|The Draa {{valley is}} famous as the date basket of Morocco. It grows more than 18 varieties. Fruit trees and {{vegetables}} are the main crops but henna is also a well known product of the region. The agriculture is very labour-intensive because it takes place on terraced fields. Seguias (small canals) transport {{the water from the}} river to the fields. Like some other ancient Berber oases in North Africa (Siwa, Kufra, Ouargla) the Draa valley was known for its qatarra, a sophisticated system of <b>underground</b> <b>irrigation</b> canals.|$|R
50|$|Sigiriya {{was a large}} rock {{rising above}} the {{surrounding}} plain, offering an unhindered view in all directions. It {{was chosen as the}} capital because of the strategic advantage this would give the defenders during an attack. Large ramparts and moats were built around the city. An elaborate and large garden was built around the rock. These gardens consisted a number of pools, fountains and other structures. A complex <b>underground</b> <b>irrigation</b> system supplied water to these pools and fountains, and the fountains are functional to this day.|$|R

5000|$|Over {{two hundred}} years later, in the {{beginning}} of the Song dynasty's Yuanyou era (1086-1094), another great poet, Su Shi (also known as Su Dongpo), came to Hangzhou to serve as the governor. At that time, the farmers suffered drought again, due to overgrowth of the weeds at the bottom of the lake clogging the <b>irrigation</b> <b>ducts.</b> He ordered dredging of the lake and piled up all the mud into another causeway, in the style of Bai Causeway, but much wider and nearly three times as long: he also planted willow trees along its banks. This causeway was later named after him as the [...] "Su Causeway". There are six bridges along the 2.6 km Su Causeway (蘇堤). [...] "Dawn on the Su Causeway in Spring 蘇堤春曉" [...] is one of the attractions.|$|R
50|$|The Afro-Asiatic {{ancestors}} of the Berber people are assumed to have spread into the area by the Late Bronze Age. The earliest known name of such a tribe {{is that of the}} Garamantes, who were based in Germa. The Garamantes were a Saharan people of Berber origin who used an elaborate <b>underground</b> <b>irrigation</b> system; they were probably present as tribal people in the Fezzan by about 1000 BCE, and were a local power in the Sahara between 500 BCE and 500 CE. By the time of contact with the Phoenicians, the first of the Semitic civilizations to arrive in Libya from the East, the Lebu, Garamantes, Berbers and other tribes that lived in the Sahara were already well established.|$|R

50|$|Because of its {{attractiveness}} {{and ease}} of cultivation, parrot feather has been introduced worldwide for use in indoor and outdoor aquaria. It is also a popular aquatic garden plant. However, it has escaped cultivation and spread via plant fragments and intentional plantings. While parrot feather may provide cover for some aquatic organisms, it can seriously change the physical and chemical characteristics of lakes and streams. The parrot feather grows abundantly, shades out naturally occurring algae, and clogs <b>irrigation</b> <b>ducts</b> and canals. The Parrot feather typically exist in bundles and extend out of the water. In large numbers, the plants make a dense mat on the water's surface. Because of this, they shade the water from sunlight and cause native plants to die because of light deficiency. The organisms that feed on the native plants can die off due to starvation. The dense mats also cause problems for recreation. Swimmers and boat propellors can become entangled. The mats are also {{a breeding ground for}} mosquitos.|$|R

40|$|Following the {{discovery}} of severe corrosion of cadmium plated steel bolts in an <b>underground</b> <b>irrigation</b> system, the corrosivity of the surrounding soil and ground water was assessed using the procedures outlined in the standard DIN 50929. This methodology predicted successfully the strongly aggressive nature of the soil from the irrigation system, which contained sulphate reducing bacteria, although the corrosivity of the ground water was low. An evaluation of alternative bolting materials was conducted using both soil from the irrigation network and soil of lower corrosivity from a university campus in Athens. This has shown that general corrosion rates for screws made from type 316 stainless steel or brass are much lower than those for ferritic steel or similar steel coated with cadmium or zinc. However, the brass and stainless steel screws both showed evidence of localised corrosion (pitting and dezincification respectively) ...|$|R
5000|$|Built in 1994 and {{originally}} designated [...] "Court A", Court Suzanne Lenglen is {{the secondary}} stadium with {{a capacity of}} 10,068 spectators. [...] Its namesake, an international celebrity and the first true star of women's tennis, won 31 major tournaments, including six French Open titles and six Wimbledon championships, between 1914 and 1926. Known as La Divine ("Divine One") and La Grand Dame ("Great Lady") of French tennis, she also won two Olympic gold medals in Antwerp in 1920. A bronze bas relief of Lenglen by the Italian sculptor Vito Tongiani stands over the east tunnel-entrance to the stadium. The trophy awarded each year to the French Open women's singles champion is named La Coupe Suzanne Lenglen in her honor.

40|$|With {{respect to}} land and water {{management}} in Iran, three paradigms can be distinguished. The pre-modern paradigm can be characterised by its key technical system (the `qanat¿ <b>underground</b> <b>irrigation</b> system), its main social institution (the `buneh¿ cooperative organisation of agricultural production), and its ethical framework (Zoroastrianism and Islam). The paradigm of industrial modernity can be identified by the partial replacement of `qanats¿ by dams, the substitution of the `buneh¿ by a system of smallholding, {{and the emergence of}} a mechanistic worldview. Since the 1970 s, industrial modernity has gradually given way to {{what has come to be}} known as `reflexive modernity¿. In Iran, the new paradigm is still in its first stage, and must be conceptualised and developed in terms of new technical systems of land and water management, of corresponding social institutions and of a new ethical framework that is sensitive to the specific features of the region...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the night}} between June 26 & 27, 2007 the {{backflow}} water from Mirani dam inundated upstream areas of Nasirabad, Nodez, and Kallatuk destroying several thousand houses, date trees, and indigenous <b>underground</b> <b>irrigation</b> channels. The damage was so extensive {{that the current}} Chief Minister of Baluchistan province, Dr. Abdul Malik Baloch who was a Senator at the time, termed the Dam as a [...] "mega-disaster" [...] and calling into question all the government assessments and forecasts about its utility. Local activists have been since then demanding the relevant authorities including WAPDA, the Planning Commission of Pakistan, and the Provincial government to pay compensation for their losses. Their specific demands include compensation of damages to houses and date trees for up to 271.2 Average Mean Sea Level (AMSL),.

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{the house was}} {{purchased}} by property/business entrepreneur, Raymond Slater who painstakingly restored the house keeping {{what was left of}} the original fixtures and fittings. The restoration included acquisition of the neighboring farm Merrydale from the notoriously thrifty Mr. Wainwright. This paved the way for the construction of a nine-hole golf course cleverly designed by golf professionals Dave Thomas and Hugh Lewis - a serial raconteur!; a system of alternative tees enabled 18 convincing holes to be played. Despite its proportions and not least, its private ownership the course was exceptionally well-specified including a full <b>underground</b> <b>irrigation</b> system and ground drainage (undertaken by contractor PE Goode of Goostrey). Slater invested heavily in the formal landscaping erecting a waterfall and an oriental garden complete with pagodas, stone Buddha's and several ponds filled with Koi carp (the entire stock disappeared subsequent to his departure to Guernsey, a theft rumored to be linked to a local farmer).|$|R

Sheep, goats, pigs, and poultry were also raised on the islands.|$|R
5000|$|Hennessey's {{advice on}} the growing of roses was often {{contrary}} to prevailing practices, and he was regarded as dogmatic and opinionated. [...] Two of his mantras which were contrary to conventional wisdom, are to not prune roots when planting roses, and that roses are so tough {{that you could do}} anything to a rose bush short of leaving it lying on the ground, and it will grow and bloom. He also advocated for the reliance on beneficial insects rather than insecticides for pest control; for allowing roses to grow unpruned for a few years before beginning annual pruning; for selecting rose cultivars that will prosper in the particular climate they will be planted in; for not adding uncomposted organic matter in planting holes; for the installation of <b>underground</b> <b>irrigation</b> in rose gardens; and for providing some shade for roses in warm climates. He also credited anonymous Chinese gardeners with the creation of the double-flowered reblooming China and Tea roses introduced into European gardens and hybridizing programs, in contrast to the prevailing belief that these roses were discovered growing wild in China by European explorers. He ridiculed the belief that the Chinese could not possibly have created something that Europe didn't have, therefore these roses must be wild species.|$|R
