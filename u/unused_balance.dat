The table had a great display of chrysanthemums, and there was orange blossom in the significant place and a wonderful cake. We also circulated upwards of a score of wedges of that accompanied by silver-printed cards in which Marion's name of Ramboat was stricken out by an arrow in favour of Ponderevo.

30|$|To {{combat the}} moral hazard, UISAs attempt to {{introduce}} “self-policing” into UI programs. Under the UISAs, each worker {{is required to}} save a fraction of earnings {{in his or her}} account and to draw unemployment benefits from it; upon retirement, any <b>unused</b> <b>balance</b> on the account is merged with the worker’s pension account. In theory, by internalizing the costs of unemployment benefits, UISAs improve work incentives and thus avoid or reduce the moral hazard inherent in traditional UI schemes (Orszag and Snower 2002) – while, in principle, they can provide the same protection as traditional UI. 20 By government matching contributions of individuals, UISAs also offer a way to expand participation in unemployment benefit programs to informal sector workers, which is another potential advantage of UISAs (for a recent overview of the experience with government matching to expand pension coverage both in developed and developing countries, see Hinz et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|In late 2008 {{and early}} 2009, the G 8 and the G 20 {{pressured}} remaining non-cooperative jurisdictions with sanctions if {{they failed to}} commit to the OECD standards of transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes and sign 12 agreements that met these standards. Leading up to this event was the continued work of the OECD to construct a treaty network to combat tax evasion by means of tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs). In this thesis, I investigate if the pressure to implement the network of tax information exchange agreements reduces tax evasion activities in jurisdictions providing banking secrecy. To measure {{the effect of these}} tax information exchange agreements I use the value of service charges banks and other financial institutions in a country apply to their foreign clients that own financial assets there. These charges are for each country included in the category financial services export in the Balance of Payments (BOP) data set. And this is the data used to analyse potential effects. In other words, I use financial services export as a proxy for foreign financial assets. The statistical software package used in this thesis is Stata 14. 1. There are two methods that I use to estimate an effect of the pressure to commit to the OECD standards and sign 12 agreements that meet the standards. The first approach is the fixed-effects (FE) model, and it is used to measure the change in financial services export as a percent of goods and services export for all countries that goes from being uncooperative to cooperative in exchanging tax information. The overall effect on the data set is then measured by this method. The second approach is called the synthetic control method and is used on the data to estimate a potential effect on an individual country's financial services export. I apply it to Switzerland as it historically has been the place to hide financial assets, with a banking secrecy law enacted in 1935, and an almost complete hegemony over the international wealth-management market until the beginning of the 1980 s. By using the fixed-effect model and, in this context, the previously <b>unused</b> <b>Balance</b> of Payments data set, I find evidence that committing to the OECD standards and signing at least 12 tax information exchange agreements to the OECD standards has no significant effect on the cumulative amount of foreign financial assets. I theorise that this is a result of heterogeneous effects, caused by spillover effects of foreign financial assets from highly cooperative jurisdictions to less cooperative jurisdictions. By using the synthetic control method on an individual country known to provide banking secrecy, Switzerland, I find a large decrease in foreign financial assets from committing to the OECD standards and signing tax information exchange agreements to the OECD standards. This strengthens the theory of heterogeneous effects from the fixed-effects model, as a reduction in Switzerland necessitates a similar opposite effect in other countries that have committed to the OECD standards and signed at least 12 agreements that meet the standards. The concerns that the bilateral agreement network does not cover enough country pairs to effectively prevent tax evasion seems to be valid. The network for each country is far from complete, and {{a large part of the}} world is completely left out because of administrative costs of implementing and enforcing agreements. This continues to provide the opportunity for a tax evader to transfer financial assets, with little risk of detection, to countries not covered by an agreement with the home country of the tax evader...|$|E

GAO was asked to review the prevalence of CDHPs, how the associated accounts are funded and used, and the factors that may contribute to the growth or limit the appeal of these plans.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2013. Major: Economics. Advisor: Jose-Victor Rios-Rull. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 73 pages, appendices A-C. This dissertation {{consists of two}} essays {{that focus on the}} role that frictions to inter-temporal exchange have in shaping the response of aggregate activity to exogenous changes in credit conditions. The first essay approaches this issue from a general equilibrium perspective. I study credit crises by considering the fact that they do not always affect all agents in the same manner. I show that during a household credit crisis, the more the productive sector saves, the more disruptive the contraction in household debt is. That is, the response of the economy is closely connected to the financial asset position of the productive sector, a statistic that can be calculated directly from aggregate data. An important feature of the model is that it is household debt, as opposed to household savings, which has a productive role. The low interest rates that ensue the contraction in household debt not only make investment cheaper, but also alter its composition. Consequently, capital ends being used in a less efficient manner, and the overall effect in economic activity is ultimately a quantitative issue. I solve the model numerically and perform a numerical evaluation of this novel channel. The second essay, co-authored with Maria Elisa Belfiori, provides a decision theoretical model of loan commitments, with the purpose of exploiting aggregate data on loan commitments to identify credit crunches. The usual difficulty for identification is that interest rate movements can be misleading {{due to the nature of}} credit markets. For instance, during a credit crunch, interest rates could go down just because funds flight to quality, or because lending contracts are indexed to policy interest rates. We sidestep this problem by exploiting data on used of <b>unused</b> <b>balances</b> of loan commitments contracts. Commercial and Industrial Loans in the U. S. are predominantly implemented using these contracts. We study the evolution of the used and unused portions during the last recession to shed light on the origin of this episode. We find that the type of movements observed in aggregate data regarding aggregate quantities can indeed be consistent with real shocks...|$|R

Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) clouds free {{companies}} of building infrastructures dimensioned for peak service demand {{and allow them}} to only pay for the resources they actually use. Being a PaaS cloud customer, on the one hand, o↵ers a company the opportunity to provide applications in a dynamically scalable way. On the other hand, this scalability may lead to financial loss due to costly use of vast amounts of resources caused by program errors, attacks, or careless use. To limit the e↵ects of involuntary resource usage, we present DQMP, a decentralized, fault-tolerant, and scalable quota-enforcement protocol. It allows customers to buy a fixed amount of resources (e. g., CPU cycles) that can be used flexibly within the cloud. DQMP utilizes the concept of di↵usion to equally <b>balance</b> <b>unused</b> resource quotas over all processes running applications of the same customer. This enables the enforcement of upper bounds while being highly adaptive to all kinds of resourcedemand changes. Our evaluation shows that our protocol outperforms a lease-based centralized implementation in a setting with 1, 000 processes. ...|$|R

System {{partitioning}} {{provides the}} users of high-performance parallel servers with the flexibility in resource allocation and dynamic reconfiguration {{as well as}} fault isolation. However, the bandwidth of links that connect different domains can be wasted while links within the same domains are congested. In this paper, we present a routing mechanism that can utilize the bandwidth of otherwise <b>unused</b> links to <b>balance</b> the message traffic and lead to lower message latencies for the latency-sensitive transactions. The performance of the proposed routing mechanism was studied using an analytical model with on-line transaction processing type workload parameters. The results indicated the proposed routing mechanism reduced the congestion on the direct paths significantly and lowered the queuing delay for the links. For example, when a 4 -cluster system with a fully connected network with the bandwidth of 3. 2 GB/s per link is partitioned into two 2 -cluster domains, the queuing delay was reduced from 53 ns to 37 ns and resulted in the improvement of CPI by 2 %.

40|$|Opportunistic {{computing}} is {{the recent}} application of delay-tolerant networking {{to the creation}} of networks of mobile devices that give users the capability to share and access services provided by other (mobile) devices in proximity without using any cellular infrastructures. The importance of this paradigm becomes apparent given the ubiquitous proliferation of personal mobile devices in recent years. Opportunistic computing {{can also be used to}} realise service offloading, a recent trend in mobile networking research where resources on the edge of the cellular network are used in synergy with the cloud infrastructure. The importance of this application of opportunistic computing comes from the data traffic generated by mobile devices that, in the last few years, has been steadily increasing. While the development of LTE and LTE-A will boost cellular network capacity, it is unclear whether this would be enough to support the expected exponential increase in traffic demands in the medium term. Opportunistic techniques can contribute to solve this problem by offloading computation and data access to locally available devices, exploiting <b>unused</b> resources and <b>balancing</b> allocation of users requests to obtain an increase in service provisioning performances and avoiding network congestion. This thesis brings contributions in two different scenarios: the first one is purely opportunistic with the detailing of a distributed system for the establishment and self-organization of mobile service provisioning. The system is established by each device autonomously collecting and using context information to individuate sequential compositions of resources for service provisioning and, thanks to a stochastic model, find the alternative that is expected to result in the lowest service provisioning time. In the second scenario, this thesis presents a solution for the integration of the opportunistic paradigm into a mobile edge system, where service provisioning is orchestrated between mobile devices and a remote cloud system thanks to the collaboration with network base stations local to the mobile devices. In the first scenario, experiments are presented to validate the decision algorithms and the stochastic model they rely on, while in the second scenario, we evaluate the performance gains obtained by using the opportunistic paradigm for service offloading in respect to traditional remote cloud systems...|$|R
