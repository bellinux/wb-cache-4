5000|$|Professor Sloan is {{distinguished}} {{for the development}} of pioneering new methods which can be used to predict the <b>ultimate</b> <b>limit</b> <b>states</b> of geostructures such as tunnels, dams, highways and foundations. Being able to estimate the limit load accurately is {{complicated by the fact that}} the behaviour of geomaterials is dilatant, nonlinear, heterogeneous, anisotropic and dependent on the pore pressures and ground water conditions. His work is based on the limit theorems of plasticity, applied via novel finite element techniques. His research has made fundamental contributions to the science of geomechanics, enabling engineers to model complex geomaterial behaviour in a robust manner, leading to cheaper and safer civil infrastructure worldwide.|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of vertical, horizontal and moment (VHM) loads {{acting on a}} shallow foundation is complex, and {{it is becoming increasingly}} popular to represent <b>ultimate</b> <b>limit</b> <b>states</b> under general VHM loading as failure envelopes in three-dimensional load space. General loading is of particular interest offshore, where harsh environmental conditions lead to large horizontal and moment foundation loads. Shallow foundations with peripheral skirts that penetrate into the seabed are used to resist large lateral and overturning forces. During undrained loading, tensile resistance can be mobilised {{on the underside of the}} base plate by suctions developed within the skirt compartment. This paper presents failure envelopes and kinematic mechanisms for undrained <b>ultimate</b> <b>limit</b> <b>states</b> of circular skirted foundations in uniform and heterogeneous deposits under general VHM loading based on finite element results. An approximating method is proposed that permits accurate prediction of <b>ultimate</b> <b>limit</b> <b>states</b> under a full range of general loading. </p...|$|E

Stochastic {{analysis of the}} <b>ultimate</b> <b>limit</b> <b>state</b> of a slender member IPE 220 under bending was elaborated.

In the design of steel beams the performance of the structural elements is often limited by the serviceability requirements, which are related to the serviceability <b>limit</b> <b>state</b> (SLS) using different load combinations than those applied in the <b>ultimate</b> <b>limit</b> <b>state.</b> The current study aims to investigate the reliability for serviceability design for flexural steel members according to the specifications of the Eurocode.

40|$|A {{foundation}} {{system may}} involve {{more than a}} single footing with an arrangement such that the footings are sufficiently closely spaced that adjacent footings interact. Vertical, horizontal, and moment capacity of multifooting foundation systems are potentially dependent on footing interaction, and in particular overturning capacity can be significantly enhanced by the structural rigidity of a multifooting foundation system. There is no established procedure for the calculation of bearing capacity of a shallow foundation system comprising cojoined footings and ad hoc approaches may simply involve summing the <b>ultimate</b> <b>limit</b> <b>states</b> of the individual footings as if they acted independently; neglecting additional capacity of the system available from the kinematic constraint provided by the structural connection between the footings.

40|$|A {{main concern}} related to safety of {{offshore}} structures is the hydrodynamic loading {{of the structure}} during its expected lifetime. The safety of a fixed or floating structure is contingent on the robust design of the structure. Design of an offshore structure is usually based on a methodology in which a target component safety level is obtained by defining specific <b>limit</b> <b>states</b> and ensuring that the environmental loads do not exceed these limits. The most typical <b>limit</b> <b>states</b> are the <b>Ultimate</b> <b>Limit</b> <b>State</b> corresponding to the ultimate resistance of the structure for carrying loads and the Fatigue <b>Limit</b> <b>State</b> related {{to the possibility of}} failure due to the effect of cyclic loading. For each of the <b>limit</b> <b>states</b> representative loads are defined. For the <b>ultimate</b> <b>limit</b> <b>state,</b> the characteristic load corresponds to a load with an annual probability of exceedance equal to or less than 10 - 2. For the fatigue <b>limit</b> <b>state,</b> the characteristic load is the expected load history on the structure during its lifetime [1]. For offshore structures the main environmental loads are loads induced by waves, wind and current. Other loads can be due to earthquake, tidal effects or snow and ice. An <b>ultimate</b> <b>limit</b> <b>state</b> with 10 - 2 annual probability of exceedance is defined as a certain combination of the different environmental loads. A typical combination is wind with annual probability o...|$|R
40|$|The linear elastic {{analysis}} is over-conservative and not suitable {{to predict the}} actual response of continuous steel-concrete composite beams. Actually the structural response {{is influenced by the}} non-linear behaviour of component materials for each load level, both at <b>ultimate</b> and serviceability <b>limit</b> <b>states.</b> Therefore the modern codes [01, 02] permit to carry out either linear elastic analyses with some moment redistribution or rigid plastic analyses. The former analyses can be employed both to check the maximum deflection at serviceability and to verify the beams at collapse, whereas the latter can be used at the <b>ultimate</b> <b>limit</b> <b>state</b> only.

Vertical and moment capacity of rectangular footings, with either zero or unlimited tension interfaces, is shown to increase with reducing footing length, for foundations of a given bearing area. For footings unable to sustain tension, footing aspect ratio {{does not affect the}} shape of the failure envelope: therefore <b>ultimate</b> <b>limit</b> <b>states</b> of a footing of any aspect ratio can be derived from a unique envelope scaled by the appropriate ultimate limit loads defining its apex points.
