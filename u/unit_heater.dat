Issues covered include equipment capital costs, fuel requirements, maintenance and operating costs, system control and integration into conventional hot water greenhouse heating systems.

In most applications, peaking systems sized for 60 % of the peak load are able to satisfy over 95 % of the annual heating requirements and cost less than $ 0. 15 per square foot per year to operate.

40|$|The {{traditional}} geometry for {{surface mount}} devices is the peripheral array where the leads {{are on the}} edges of the device. As the technology drives towards high input/output (I/O) count (increasing number of leads) and smaller packages with finer pitch (less distance between peripheral leads), limitations on peripheral surface mount devices arise. The leads on these fine pitch devices are fragile and can be easily bent. It becomes increasingly difficult to deliver solder past to leads spaced as little as 0. 012 inch apart. Too much solder mass can result in bridging between leads while too little solder can contribute to the loss of mechanical and electrical continuity. A solution is to shift the leads from the periphery of the device to the area under the device. This scheme is called areal array packaging and is exemplified by the ball grid array (BGA) package. A system has been designed and constructed to deposit an entire array of several hundred uniform solder droplets onto a printed circuit board in a fraction of a second. The solder droplets wet to the interconnect lands on a pc board and forms a basis for later application of a BGA device. The system consists of a piezoelectric solder pulse <b>unit,</b> <b>heater</b> controls, an inert gas chamber and an analog power supply/pulse unit...|$|E

40|$|A hollow cathode-based plasma {{contactor}} {{has been}} selected for use on the Space Station. During {{the operation of the}} plasma contactor, the hollow cathode heater will endure approximately 12000 thermal cycles. Since a hollow cathode heater failure would result in a plasma contactor failure, a hollow cathode heater development program was established to produce a reliable heater. The development program includes the heater design, process documents for both heater fabrication and assembly, and heater testing. The heater design was a modification of a sheathed ion thruster cathode heater. Heater tests included testing of the <b>heater</b> <b>unit</b> alone and plasma contactor and ion thruster testing. To date, eight heaters have been or are being processed through <b>heater</b> <b>unit</b> testing, two through plasma contactor testing and three through ion thruster testing, all using direct current power supplies. Comparisons of data from <b>heater</b> <b>unit</b> performance tests before cyclic testing, plasma contactor tests, and ion thruster tests at the ignition input current level show the average deviation of input power and tube temperature near the cathode tip to be +/- 0. 9 W and +/- 21 C, respectively. <b>Heater</b> <b>unit</b> testing included cyclic testing to evaluate reliability under thermal cycling.

This study was commissioned in order to analyze the economic benefits of incorporating both heat recovery and air preheating methods into the existing fired <b>heater</b> <b>units.</b> Four fired <b>heater</b> <b>units</b> were analyzed from the energy and environmental point of views. Moreover, the second law efficiency {{and the rate of}} irreversibility were also analyzed via the exergy analysis. Both analyses was indicative {{of the fact that the}} heat recovery process enhances both the first and second law efficiencies while simultaneously assisting in the production of high and low pressure water steam. The implementation and usage of the process improves the thermal and exergy efficiencies from 63. 4 % to 71. 7 % and 49. 4 %, to 54. 8 %, respectively. Additionally, the heat recovery and air preheating methods leads to a substantial reduction in fuel consumption, in the realm of up to 7. 4 %, while also simultaneously decreasing heat loss and the irreversibility of the unit. Nevertheless, the results of the economic analysis posits that although utilizing an air preheater unit enhances the thermal performance of the system, due to the air preheater's capital and maintenance costs, incorporating an air preheater unit to an existing fired heater is not economically justifiable. Furthermore, the results of the sensitivity analysis and payback period showed that the economic results are highly susceptible to the interest rate, and the payback period for the most economical case is 2. 6 years...|$|R
