5|$|Grammar is {{the study}} of how {{meaningful}} elements called morphemes within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If they are free to be moved around within an <b>utterance,</b> they are usually called words, and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called morphology. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called syntax.|$|E

For a very brief period {{he served as a}} volunteer ambulance driver before ill health forced his return to Britain. Subsequently, Nevinson volunteered for home service with the Royal Army Medical Corps. He used these experiences as the subject matter for a series of powerful paintings which used the machine aesthetic of Futurism and the influence of Cubism to great effect. His fellow artist Walter Sickert wrote at the time that Nevinson's painting La Mitrailleuse, 'will probably remain the most authoritative and concentrated <b>utterance</b> on the war in the history of painting.' In 1917, Nevinson was appointed an official war artist, but he was no longer finding Modernist styles adequate for describing the horrors of modern war, and he increasingly painted in a more realistic manner. Nevinson's later World War One paintings, based on short visits to the Western Front, lacked the same powerful effect as those earlier works which had helped to make him {{one of the most famous}} young artists working in England.|$|E

Obviously we should have criteria to divide child's <b>utterances</b> into some classes including cries and non-cries. Thus we carried out an experiment in which a mother listened to her child's <b>utterances</b> and classified them into certain categories.

40|$|Child's {{learning}} {{language is}} a fascinating matter to be observed all the time. The way a child constructs a sentence always makes anybody around him/her curious. There are so many observations deal with this matter that create child language acquisition theories. However, the writer notices there are such still a few linguists observing/studying Indonesian children. Nevertheless, linguistic theories are universal in which any observers are able to apply them to any children {{although there are some}} differences. Based on that reason, the writer carried out an Indonesian child observation in acquiring her language. This study concerns with the production of <b>utterances</b> as uttered by a two year- old Indonesian child and the language functions which are reflected in the <b>utterances.</b> The data of this study which was collected with a tape recorder and a diary were transcribed and analyzed under the parameters of kinds of sentences, the syntactic patterns, and language functions in the subject's one-word <b>utterances,</b> two-word <b>utterances,</b> three-word <b>utterances,</b> and more-than-three-word <b>utterances.</b> This study is a case study since the writer only analyzed one Indonesian child to find out the kinds of sentences, the syntactic patterns, and the language functions that were produced in the subject's one-word <b>utterances,</b> two-word <b>utterances,</b> three-word <b>utterances,</b> and more-than-three-word <b>utterances.</b> After analyzing the data, the writer found that the subject only produced the headword in her one-word <b>utterances.</b> Meanwhile, in two-word <b>utterances,</b> the subject practised the pivotal structure in which her pattern was Pivot + Open. In this case her pivot words was the function words and her open words were the content words. Apart from that, the subject had been able to produce sentences which consists of subject, predicate, and object in her three-word <b>utterances.</b> She had already produced more-than-three-word <b>utterances</b> which came to resemble adult language. Generally, the produced sentences were various. They are simple affirmative statements, negative statements, interrogative statements, and imperative statements. Even in the production of three-word <b>utterances,</b> the subject of the study began to produce passive statements although the form was not perfect. The produced <b>utterances</b> reflect language functions. In the subject's one word <b>utterances,</b> they imply only three kinds of language functions, i. e. informational, expressive, and directive. Starting from two-word <b>utterances</b> until the subject was able to produce more-than-three-word <b>utterances,</b> the language she produced began to reflect a phatic function. What is interesting to notice is that her <b>utterances</b> may also reflect two functions at the same time. Finally, this study is intended to give a contribution to Psycholinguistics and further observation dealing with Indonesian child's language development...|$|R

The research findings show that in teaching-learning process there were three kinds of persuasive <b>utterances</b> and five techniques of persuasive <b>utterances</b> that teacher used in made interaction with the students. Those are ethos, pathos, logos, association technique, integration technique, reward technique, arrangement technique and red-herring technique.
