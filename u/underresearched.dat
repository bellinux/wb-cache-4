50|$|Nearly half {{a century}} ago, Edith Penrose (1959) pointed out that {{superior}} profitability (e.g. return on sales or return on assets) was neither interesting to investors - who value the prospect of increasing future cash flows - nor sustainable over time. Profitability is not entirely unimportant - it does after all provide the investment in new resources to enable growth to occur. More recently, Rugman and Verbeke (2002) have reviewed {{the implications of this}} observation for research in strategy.

5000|$|Bermudian English {{has been}} called [...] "one of the most {{severely}} <b>underresearched</b> varieties of English". It primarily shows a mixture of traits typical of British English and American English, and is generally classified {{as a form of}} American (rather than Caribbean) English. The most detailed scholarly study of Bermudian English, in 1933, stated that this type of speech [...] "would create least remark, if indeed any, between, say, Norfolk, Virginia, and Charleston, South Carolina"; British-Bermudian actor Earl Cameron noted that because the Bermudian accent sounded American, he was able to land a speaking role in 1942. Large scale West Indian immigration to Bermuda, especially Sandys and Pembroke parishes, began with the expansion of the Royal Naval Dockyard (as a result of the lack of cheap, unskilled labour in Bermuda) {{at the turn of the}} 19th/20th Century, and affected the dialect of certain demographic groups. Consequently, in certain aspects of vocalization, some Bermudian English dialects are close to some versions of Caribbean English, and some would bracket all these varieties to the broad region of the [...] "English-speaking West Indies". Azorean Portuguese has also impacted on Bermudian English as a result of immigration since the 1840s.|$|E

He opines that Lowney had [...] "beautifully" [...] described her encounters, {{but that it was}} [...] "unfortunate" [...] that she spent so much of the text reflecting on her logistical challenges, subsequently describing Søderlind and Dyrendal's contribution as [...] "one of the most lively and entertaining" [...] parts of the volume. He remarks positively of Granholm's criticism of the term [...] "Satanism", describing his chapter as a [...] "crucial contribution", and believing that he has made a [...] "good case" [...] for the term [...] "Left Hand Path". Moving on to review the inclusion of primary documents {{at the end of the}} volume, he believes that the works presented appear [...] "minor in context", and that it is unfortunate that texts from LaVey and Aquino were not included. As such, he believes that Contemporary Religious Satanism is not [...] "the perfect reader." [...] Wishing that philosophical and symbolic analyses of Satanism had been included alongside the sociological studies, he also felt that [...] "much more can be made" [...] regarding the differences between LaVeyan-influenced secular Satanists and the mystical Left-Hand Path followers. He believed that the volume would be of great interest to scholars of magic, contemporary Paganism and new religious movements.|$|E

This paper adopts a framework from social sciences that views social context as a sequence of turns taken between participants.

Our study aims to fill this gap and to identify the extent and backgrounds of these differences in business performance. We will introduce this topic by providing a concise literature overview.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to map out the {{research}} around the concept of interactivity, as well as to point out the dominant streams and <b>underresearched</b> areas. It is based upon the content analysis of methods employed in articles published in five topranking communication journals over five year period (200610). The review of methods applied in research of interactivity is based upon distinction between social interactivity, textual interactivity and technical interactivity. This classification is further developed by adding the category of levels of interactivity (low, medium and high) which allows further classification of different mediated practices. This leads to specification of nine theoretical subsets of interactivity as the main categories of the analysis of research articles. Within this matrix we have situated diverse methods that respond to conceptually different types and levels of audience/users interactivity. The analysis shows that scholarly focus lies within the low textual and the high social interactive practices, whereas the high technical and high textual interactivity are <b>underresearched</b> areas. Investigations into the audience/users relations with texts are mainly orientated towards content analyses and surveys. High social interaction research is reviving the application of ethnographic methods, while the possibilities of technical interactivity are embraced not as an object but as a tool for research...|$|E

The success story of the rapid franchising network formation by a retail bank contributes to our understanding of rent generation and appropriation from social capital.

By integrating knowledge and wisdom theory with strategic leadership theory, we define what wise intellectual leadership for a sustainable, knowledge-based future is. More specifically, we argue that strategic leaders should provide intellectual leadership for a sustainable future as an explicit part of a knowledge management strategy. 19 page(s...|$|E

Analyses of 2001 Great Britain Census data reveal uneven patterns, with different concentrations of mixed-ethnicity families in distinct locations.

The concentration of mixed-ethnicity families within ethnically diverse neighbourhoods is, in part, substantiated. The discussion disrupts media representations of mixed ethnicity and assumptions of the marginalisation of deprived, mixed-ethnicity families, making a contribution to theoretical debates of processes of sociospatial segregation, ethnicity and neighbourhood chang...|$|E

Furthermore, drawing on stewardship theory, we develop a theoretical model linking reciprocal altruism, participative strategy, and role conflict among family members. We also present the moderating effects of family members ’ perceptions of collective-efficacy and group-interdependence on these relationships. We conclude by discussing future research and practical implications...|$|E
