50|$|Chemical mimicry {{refers to}} the {{production}} of one species’ chemical signals by another species. Many myrmecophilous Staphylinids have evolved chemical mimicry to deter or placate ants. Synecthrans, as non tolarated guests, primarily produce defensive secretions. Pella species produce two compounds found in their host ant Lasius fuliginosus, <b>undecane</b> and sulcatone, which elicit aggressive and panic reactions respectively. Although it seems counterintuitive to release an aggressive alarm pheromone as a defense, the presence of sulcatone stops the aggression response to <b>undecane.</b> Ants exposed to the defensive secretion act less aggressively and avoid the odor.|$|E

40|$|Spiroacetals, cryptic ketodiols {{showing a}} {{hydroxyl}} group at {{both sides of}} a carbonyl whithin reachable distances are very widespread in nature. A group of 30 different structures, not including stereoisomers, represent volatile, less polar constituents of insect secretions. Five different systems were identified: 1, 6 -dioxaspirol[4. 4]nonanes, 1, 6 -dioxaspiro[4. 5]decanes, 1, 6 -dioxaspiro[4. 6]undecanes, 1, 7 -dioxaspiro[5. 5] <b>undecanes,</b> and 1, 7 -dioxaspiro[5. 6]dodecanes. Some spiroacetals are insect pheromones: (2 S, 5 R) - 2 -ethyl- 1, 6 -dioxaspiro[4. 4]nonane, chalcogran, 1, is a key component of the male produced aggregation pheromone of the spruce bark beetle, Pityogenes cha 2 cographus. In contrast, (5 S, 7 S) - 7 -methyl- 1, 6 -dioxaspiro[4. 5]decane, 2, conophthorin, acts as a repellent or spacer in several bark beetles. Racemic 1, 7 -diosaspiro[5. 5]undecane, olean, 5, is the female produced sex pheromone of the olive fly, Bactrocera (Dacus) oleae. The most widespread spiroacetal is 2, 8 -dimethyl- 1, 7 -dioxaspiro[5. 5]undecane, 8. Tt often forms a mixture of (E,E) - and (E,Z) -isomers, the (E,E) -isomer showing (2 S, 6 R, 8 S) -configuration.

50|$|Capnellene {{has been}} a popular target for {{synthesis}} due to its molecular architecture, {{its role in the}} defense mechanism of soft corals, and the challenge posed by the high degree of functionalization, stereochemical sophistication, and the complexity of the <b>undecane</b> skeleton. In 1981, the first stereocontrolled synthesis of (±)-Δ9(12)-capnellene was performed in nine steps, with an overall yield of 60%. Their starting reagent was a dimethylated cyclopentenyl carboxaldehyde and the overall synthesis took the form of a series of pentane ring annulations. The second pentane ring was formed by condensation of the aldehyde by vinylmagnesium bromide, followed by Nazarov cyclization of the dienone. A regiospecific 3+2 cyclopentannulation, using ozonolysis and an intramolecular aldol condensation, formed the third ring and a simple dehydration reaction yielded the target capnellene.|$|E

40|$|A {{study is}} made by EPR {{spectroscopy}} {{of the nature of}} the undecyl radicals formed by gamma-irradiation of CCl 3 F/undecane at 77 K. It is observed that at low <b>undecane</b> concentration (e. g., 1 mol%) primary undecyl radicals are very prominent. With increasing <b>undecane</b> concentration, the (relative) contribution of primary undecyl radicals to undecyl formation decreases as a result of intermolecular radical site transfer and at 4 - 6 mol % <b>undecane</b> in CCl 3 F primary undecyl radicals are essentially absent. With further increases in <b>undecane</b> concentration primary undecyl radicals regain some of their prominence in the EPR spectra but only to a limited extent, contributing an estimated 5 - 10 % to the total undecyl radical concentration at for instance 20 mol % <b>undecane.</b> In view of the documented dependence of intermolecular radical site transfer on the molecular alignment in n-alkane crystals (Iwasaki, M.; Toriyama, K.; Fukaya, M.; Muto, H.; Nunome, K.

40|$|International audienceNestmate {{recognition}} in social insects generally involves matching a label to the template that is acquired {{through the early}} learning of non-volatile cuticular hydrocarbon cues. However, a possible role of the volatile chemical cues {{that exist in the}} nest, and which may also affect template formation, has not been studied. We investigated this possibility using experimental mixedspecies groups composed of the two ant species Manica rubida and Formica selysi. The experimental set-up either allowed full contact between workers of the two species or interspecific contact was hindered or prohibited by a single or a double mesh. After three months, workers of M. rubida ants were selected as focal ants for aggression tests including the following target ants: F. selysi workers from the same mixed-species group (for each of the three rearing conditions) or from a single-species group (control). Workers of M. rubida were always amicable towards their group-mates, irrespective of the experimental group (contact, single or double mesh). However, M. rubida that were not imprinted on F. selysi, expressed high levels of aggression towards the non-familiar F. selysi workers. The finding that F. selysi workers in the mixed-species groups appeared familiar to their M. rubida group-mates even without physical contact between them, suggests that the volatile cues produced by F. selysi affected nestmate {{recognition in}} M. rubida. In an attempt to identify these volatile cues we performed SPME analysis of the head space over groups of F. selysi workers. The findings revealed that F. selysi Dufour's gland constituents, with <b>undecane</b> as the major product, are released into the head space, rendering them likely candidates to affect template formation in M. rubida.
