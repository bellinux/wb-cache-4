40|$|Activity {{recognition}} in monitored environments where the occupants are elderly or disabled {{is currently a}} popular research topic and is being proposed as a possible solution that may help maintain the independence of an aging population within their homes, where these homes are adapted as monitored environments. Current activity recognition systems implement ubiquitous sensing or video surveillance techniques which inherently, to varying degrees, impinge on {{the privacy of the}} occupants of these environments. The research presented in this thesis investigates the use of Ubiquitous sensors within a smart home setting with a view to establishing whether activity recognition is possible with a reduced, less intrusive subset of sensors that can be realised using <b>utility</b> <b>meter</b> disaggregation techniques. The thesis considers the selection of sensors as a feature selection problem and concludes that data produced from water, electricity and PIR sensors contribute significantly to the recognition of selected activities. With an established method of activity recognition that implements a reduced number of sensors {{it can be argued that}} occupants of the monitored environment maintain a greater level of privacy. This level of privacy, however, is dependent on such systems being practically implementable into homes that are designed to assist and monitor the residents, and as such configuration and maintenance of these systems are also considered here. The <b>utility</b> <b>meter</b> disaggregation technique presented proves to perform exceptionally well when trained with large quantities of data, but gathering and labelling this data is, in itself, an intrusive process that requires significant effort and could compromise the practicality of such promising systems. This thesis considers methods for implementing synthesised, labelled training data for both disaggregation and activity recognition systems and shows that such techniques can significantly reduce the quantity of labelled training data required. The work presented shows a significant contribution, in the areas of sensor selection and the use of <b>utility</b> <b>meter</b> disaggregation for activity recognition, and also the use of synthesised labelled training data to reduce significant system training times. The work is carried out using a combination of publicly available datasets and data collected from a purpose built smart home which includes water and electricity meter disaggregation. It is shown that a system for non-intrusive monitoring within an ambient environment, occupied by a single resident, is achievable using repurposed versions of the standard domestic infrastructure.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes a}} security policy for a distributed utility metering system. The system uses untrusted networks, {{such as the}} Internet, to communicate between service providers (water, gas, electricity etc.) and the gateway servers at customer premises. Within a building, the system uses a low-bandwidth mains-borne network, or Field-Area Network (FAN), such as Fieldbus, to communicate between the gateway server {{and each of the}} utility meters. The FAN is regarded as untrusted, and communications to and from each <b>utility</b> <b>meter</b> must be protected from all other meters and any possible outsiders on the network. It must also be assumed that the gateway server is physically vulnerable to attack, and that its loss must not jeopardise the security of the system. Each service provider must be able to access each <b>utility</b> <b>meter</b> individually. Service providers can send commands to individual utility meters, and obtain individual meter readings applicable to their service. Service providers must not be able to interfere with one another’s service. However, the gateway must be able to interpret communications initiated by individual meters, to ensure that the alarm can be raised to service providers if a meter reading appears to have been tampered with. On high-bandwidth networks, well known symmetric and public-key cryptography techniques can easily provide the required features. However, with a low-bandwidth network such as FANs, the protocol must be carefully optimised to minimise the amount of data transmitted. This dissertation describes a new architecture, in which well-known cryptography principles are applied in the FAN field in a way that has not been described in the literature.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} {{the challenges of}} monitoring energy consumption to assess behavioral changes in occupants during renovation projects and how to develop a strategy to overcome those challenges. Three buildings containing seventeen flats in total were monitored {{during a period of}} over two years, monitoring energy consumption and internal temperature of the flats. The energy consumption for the flats was capture by the use of a Current Cost smart meter placed at the ground floor of each block of flats in a cover under stairs. Wireless sensors were clamped to each flat. The smart meters were not connected to the internet or a computer, but instead the data was stored in the internal memory of the equipment and manually downloaded to a computer at each data collection visit. For the purpose of double checking, meter readings were collected at the electricity meter to be able to compared the accuracy and success of the data collected by the Current Cost smart meters. The internal temperature of every flat was collected by mean of a LogTag temperature data. From comparing the Current Cost smart meter data versus the <b>utility</b> <b>meter</b> readings a huge range of overestimation and underestimation of the actual energy consumption was observed. Regarding the internal temperature monitoring, long periods of lost data was identified. The main factors contributing to these data lost were: Long periods between data collection, wireless signal drop offs, unplugging, tampering and removal of equipment. A normalized energy index, based on <b>utility</b> <b>meter</b> readings, internal temperature and outdoor conditions, was developed to overcome the loss of data and assess the effectiveness of the technology and the behavioral change in the occupants. The normalised energy index provides a methodology to evaluate technology and behavioural changes effect between flats and across seasons...|$|E
