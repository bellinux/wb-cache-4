A total of 632 sexually transmitted infected index patients and 168 sexual partners (156 partner referral and 12 provider referral) were seen at ten health centres of Chiweshe Communal Area, Mashonaland Central Province between September 1998 and March 1999. All STI index patients who visited the study sites were observed, counselled and treated by the nurses. A questionnaire to determine the reproductive/ sexual behaviour of patients and their partners was administered to the index patient. Of the 632 index patients observed, almost half (46 percent) presented with vaginal discharge syndrome, 26 percent with genital ulcer disease and 16 percent with <b>urethral</b> discharge <b>syndrome.</b> Out of a total of 168 partners referred to the health centres, 93 percent had been referred by index patients and only 7 percent by health workers. The majority (61 percent) of the index patients were female. On average, the index patients were 30. 03 + 9. 97 years old. The majority of the clients (56 percent index patients and 70 percent contacts) were married (monogamous). About a third of all the clients had completed form four (Ordinary Level) and were highly knowledgeable of STIs - particularly genital ulcers and <b>urethral</b> discharge <b>syndrome.</b> Friends and relatives were reported to be the first source of information on STIs. About half the index patients reported that they never use condoms and yet they felt they were at high risk of contracting STIs because their partners were not faithful. This survey established that people’s behaviour has not been significantly changed by the AIDS pandemic. There is urgent need to find out why condom use is low, even when people do feel to be at risk...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTBetween July 2002 and July 2004, {{all male}} {{patients}} (n = 307) presenting to a {{sexually transmitted disease}} (STD) clinic who reported unprotected sex {{were enrolled in the}} study. Of these, 63 (20. 5 %), 19 (6. 2 %) and one (0. 3 %) were infected with one, two and three pathogens, respectively. The prevalences of chlamydial infection, gonorrhoea, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus infection and trichomoniasis were 14. 3 %, 10. 1 %, 6. 8 %, 2. 2 % and 0 %, respectively. The sensitivities of <b>urethral</b> discharge <b>syndrome</b> for detection of chlamydial, gonococcal, and combined forms of infection were 31. 8 %, 58. 5 % and 70. 0 %, respectively, with specificities of 93. 5 %, 97. 1 % and 93. 9 %, respectively. Positive predictive values (PPVs) were 56. 0 %, 68. 0 % and 28. 0 % for chlamydial and gonococcal infections and combinations of the two forms, respectively. In contrast, the sensitivity of genital ulceration syndrome for syphilis detection was only 38. 0 %, although the specificity was 82. 5 %, and the PPV was 32. 0 %.

40|$|Aims: To {{validate}} syndromic {{management of}} cases having genital ulcerative disease (GUD) and <b>urethral</b> discharge <b>syndrome</b> (UDS). Materials and Methods: A study of 113 cases of GUD and UDS {{was carried out}} in the Department of Skin and VD from March 2011 to August 2012. All cases having history and clinical evidence suggestive of GUD and UDS were included in the study. Results: According to syndromic diagnosis, GUD herpetic syndrome was the most common 71 (62. 27 %), followed by GUD non-herpetic syndrome 25 (21. 89 %) and UDS 17 (14. 91 %). Out of 71 cases clinically diagnosed as GUD herpetic, 16 (22. 53 %) were validated by immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti herpes simplex virus- 2 (HSV) serology, 14 (19. 71 %) by Tzanck smear and 3 (4. 22 %) by both. 24 (33. 80 %) were Reactive plasma Reagin (RPR) (< 1 : 8) reactive and trepenomma palidum haem-agglutination positive.

40|$|Introduction: Treatment {{of sexually}} {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) {{has been made}} easy for field workers due to syndromic approach. The etiological agent responsible for different STI syndromes needs to be validated {{from time to time}} so as to guide the therapeutic regimen. Aims and Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the etiological agent for STI syndromes and correlate the syndromic diagnosis with etiological diagnosis. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted over 9 months in all patients attending the STI and Gynaecology Outpatient Department. Syndromic diagnosis was done by STI-trained medical officer of respective clinic. Sample was collected for etiological diagnosis and subjected to relevant investigations. Data were analyzed by applying statistical methods. Results: Among 308 patients (male:female = 1 : 3. 5), no syndromic diagnosis could be made in 11 cases (all females and had premalignant changes on Pap smear). In 68 patients (22. 08 %), no etiological diagnosis could be arrived at (mostly genital ulcer disease [GUD]-herpetic [H] and vaginal discharge). In cervical discharge syndrome, six patients (16. 7 %) showed gonococcus. In GUD-H syndrome, 37 patients (27. 027 %) were tested positive. In GUD-nonherpetic syndrome, three patients (33. 33 %) were syphilis, granuloma inguinale, and chancroid (1 each). In <b>urethral</b> discharge <b>syndrome,</b> etiology could not be found in 33 cases (45. 45 %). In vaginal discharge syndrome (n = 217), etiologies were overlapping as follows: trichomonas vaginalis (76. 04 %), bacterial vaginosis (40 %), gonococcus (24 %), and undiagnosed (6. 5 %). Conclusion: The present tool for validation of GUD-H can validate only 27 % of cases. Overlap of etiologies is mostly common in vaginal discharge syndrome, wherein malignancies and premalignant conditions are overtreated with kits. Validation can be done only in two-third of cases with the available resources. However, syndromic approach provides the opportunity of treating STI without delay...|$|R

40|$|Context: These {{guidelines}} were prepared {{on behalf of}} the European Association of Urology (EAU) to help urologists assess the evidence-based management of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) and to incorporate the recommendations into their clinical practice. Objective: To revise guidelines for the diagnosis, therapy, and follow-up of CPP patients. Evidence acquisition: Guidelines were compiled by a working group and based on a systematic review of current literature using the PubMed database, with important papers reviewed for the 2003 EAU guidelines as a background. A panel of experts weighted the references. Evidence synthesis: The full text of the guidelines is available through the EAU Central Office and the EAU Web site (www. uroweb. org). This article is a short version of the full guidelines text and summarises the main conclusions from the guidelines on the management of CPP. Conclusions: A guidelines text is presented including chapters on chronic prostate pain and bladder pain <b>syndromes,</b> <b>urethral</b> pain, scrotal pain, pelvic pain in gynaecologic practice, neurogenic dysfunctions, the role of the pelvic floor and pudendal nerve, psychological factors, general treatment of CPP, nerve blocks, and neuromodulation.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Sacral nerve {{stimulation}} (SNS) {{is an effective}} treatment for women with urinary retention. Some women present specific electromyography abnormalities of the external <b>urethral</b> sphincter (Fowler's <b>syndrome).</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate whether Fowler's syndrome and psychologic preimplant screening could be predictive factors for long-term success of SNS in women with urinary retention. METHODS: All patients underwent electrophysiologic and urodynamic studies and voiding charts. A validated psychologic screening questionnaire was used. Women with successful temporary stimulation, received a definitive implant (Interstim Medtronic). They were followed prospectively every 6 months. Failure was defined as recurrent retention needing intermittent or permanent catheterisation. RESULTS: Sixty-two women were implanted, 30 with Fowler's syndrome, 32 with idiopathic retention. In those with Fowler's syndrome, 26. 6 % screened positive for somatisation, as did 43. 8 % in the idiopathic group (not significant [ns]). Screening for depression was positive in 30 % and 18. 8 %, respectively (ns). There was no correlation with outcome. Twenty-eight patients failed: 9 with Fowler's syndromes, 19 without (p= 0. 04). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with Fowler's syndrome benefitted significantly longer from SNS (log-rank test, p= 0. 005). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of Fowler's syndrome is a positive predictive factor for SNS in female urinary retention. Idiopathic urinary retention patients can benefit as well, but the success might be less predictable. Preimplant psychologic screening, using the Patient Health Questionnaire, does not correlate with long-term outcome of SNS in this population. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Introduction A {{prospective}} {{study was conducted}} to evaluate the success of neuromodulation in women with bladder emptying disorders with or without complex repetitive discharges and decelerations on concentric needle EMG of the external <b>urethral</b> sphincter (Fowler <b>syndrome).</b> Material and Methods Twenty-one patients received a definitive implant (Medtronic InterStimÂ® System) between 1996 - 1998; 12 patients with Fowler's syndrome (57 %) and 9 patients without (43 %). Their mean age was 43 years (23 - 59) and the mean follow-up was 24. 1 months (6 - 31). Follow-up was done every 3 months. An "excellent" response was defined as normal uroflowmetry without residual. A partial response was defined as abnormal uroflowmetry with a residual 150 ml. Results Overall, there was an excellent result in 62 %, a partial response in 19 % and failure in 19 %. In the Fowler group, an excellent result was achieved in 75 %, 8. 4 % had a partial response and 16. 6 % ended in failure. In the non-Fowler group, we noticed an excellent result in 45 %, partial in 33 % and poor in 22 %. Conclusion Sacral nerve stimulation can be a successful treatment for women with bladder emptying disorders. The presence of complex repetitive discharges and decelerations on the concentric needle EMG is a positive prognostic factor.

40|$|Objective: To {{review the}} initial {{experience}} of potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) laser photoselective vaporization {{of the prostate}} (PVP). Materials and methods: Thirty patients with benign prostatic enlargement who underwent PVP at our institution between March 2007 and June 2009 were prospectively analyzed. The efficacy of the procedure was assessed using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Quality of Life (QoL) score, maximum flow rate (QMax), and post-void residual volume (PVR) at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery and then annually thereafter. Operative time, laser energy and fiber use, and any procedural or postoperative complications were noted. Results: Fourteen (47 %) patients opted for PVP by choice, and 16 (53 %) underwent PVP because they were at high-risk for transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), KTP laser PVP was successfully performed in all patients without any intraoperative complications. The median prostate volume was 47 g (range 25 - 136 g). Median operative time, laser energy, and hospital stay were 84 min (range 66 - 109 min), 126. 1 kJ (range 27. 6 - 235. 5 kJ), and 2 days (range 1 - 9 days), respectively. IPSS, QoL score, QMax, and PVR improved from preoperative median values of 22, 04, 09 mL/sec, and 206 mL to 03, 01, 19. 7 mL/sec, and 30. 5 mL, respectively, postoperatively. No patient required blood transfusion or had TURP <b>syndrome.</b> <b>Urethral</b> stricture developed in only 2 (6. 6 %) patients in our study.

40|$|The {{cause of}} the female <b>urethral</b> <b>syndrome</b> has {{previously}} been obscure, {{as it has been}} associated by definition with a lack of objective findings but a plethora of subjective complaints of retropubic pressure, dyspareunia, urinary frequency, and dysuria. There is now strong evidence that the microscopic paraurethral glands connected to the distal third of the urethra in the prevaginal space are homologous to the prostate. They stain histologically for prostate-specific antigen and, like the prostate, are subject to both infection and cancer. The most important aspect of recognizing this microscopic "female prostate" as an anatomic feature is that its infections may completely explain many cases of the <b>urethral</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Further, the diagnosis is not elusive if trained clinicians palpate for localized and objective paraurethral tenderness through the anterior vagina wall to one or both sides of the urethra. Treatment parallel to that for male prostatitis is usually rewarded by the elimination of symptoms and the objective finding of the loss of tenderness of the paraurethral glands. As with prostatitis, the localized problem often recurs.

The study included all women aged 25 years and over on 1 May 1987 who had been registered with one rural, dispensing practice over the study period, 1 May 1985 to 1 May 1989. A self-administered questionnaire was sent to the women on 1 May 1987 and a second, similar, questionnaire was sent two years later. A total of 721 women responded to the two questionnaires (response rate 97 %). Regular symptoms of frequency and dysuria were reported by 8 % of women in 1987 and 14 % in 1989. Four percent of women reported symptoms throughout the four year study period. Symptoms were found to be least common in the 55 - 74 years age group. Although none of the women who were sexually inactive reported regular symptoms no association was reported between recent sexual intercourse and symptoms. Neither was an association demonstrated between type of contraception used and symptoms. However, it was found that premenopausal women reported significantly more symptoms than postmenopausal women. The number of women involved in this study was too small to allow the importance of change of sexual partner to be determined. Significantly more of the women who reported regular symptoms had been treated for urinary tract infection than of those who did not report regular symptoms.

Urinary pus cell counts were also carried out and sometimes found to be misleading. Of the 14 children found to have an infection, three had a radiological abnormality. Five of the children had a recurrence of infection within the first two years, and one an asymptomatic bacteriuria seven years after diagnosis. Only six out of 34 children presenting with dysuria had infected urine, and an association was discovered between abacterial dysuria (or the <b>urethral</b> <b>syndrome)</b> in the remainder and a concurrent upper respiratory tract infection. All children should undergo radiological investigation after their first confirmed infection. Diagnosis and management could be improved by providing all general practitioners with a semiquantitative method of urine culture such as the dip slide...|$|E
40|$|Background. Urinary {{infection}} in otherwise healthy women {{has largely been}} a straightforward matter of diagnosis by identifying bacteria in the urine, and then cure by appropriate antibiotics. Recent research has shown this to be over-simplified. Evaluation of methods of self-management of symptoms has been neglected. Discussion. Firstly trial data show that women with what used to called 2 ̆ 7 <b>urethral</b> <b>syndrome</b> 2 ̆ 7 (urinary symptoms but sterile urine) obtain relief from antibiotics. Other trial data have shown a surprisingly large placebo effect from the resolution of symptoms among women who feel their care has been 2 ̆ 7 positive 2 ̆ 7. In addition, data published this month in BMC Medicine show that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs provide symptom relief to women with conventional infections (positive urine bacteriology) as much as antibiotics. Conclusions. These recent findings {{provide an opportunity to}} consider how clinicians might change practice, and sets a new research agenda. We need to know (1) whether the effect of NSAIDs is replicable; (2) why some women in previous trials have had more symptoms if not treated with antibiotics sooner; (3) whether NSAIDs and antibiotics have an additive effect on relieving symptoms; (4) how we can harness the placebo effect better to assist out patients with this distressing and common complaint...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionFibromyalgia (FM) is a rheumatic {{condition}} {{characterized by}} a picture of gener- alized chronic pain, hyperalgesia and allodynia. Symptoms such as fatigue, sleep disorders, morning stiffness, headache and paresthesia can also be present. It is also associated with other comorbidities, such as depression, anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, myofascial pain syndrome and nonspecific <b>urethral</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Few studies have addressed the evolution of FM, especially regarding medium and long-term evolution, such as why some patients do better than others, despite the fact of being submitted to the same treatment. ObjectiveTo determine {{whether there is a}} correlation between demographic and clinical variables and FM severity. Material and methodsSixty women who met the classification criteria for FM of the Ameri- can College of Rheumatology of 1990 were divided into three groups, according to the sever- ity established by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) : severe (70 - 100), moderate (50 to 70) and mild (0 to 50). ResultsNine demographic and clinical variables were assessed, with a significant differ- ence (P < 0. 05) being observed only in the groups showing higher FIQ scores with the pres- ence of depression and workers’ compensation interests. ConclusionThe impact of FM measured by the FIQ is directly correlated with the severity of depression and the presence of workers’ compensation interests...|$|E
40|$|A process, {{outcome and}} salary-cost {{analysis}} {{was made of}} the use of a urinary tract infection/vaginitis protocol. Three nurse practitioners, in a university-based, walk-in clinic, cared for 128 women presenting with complaints of dysuria or vaginal discharge, or both. There were no significant differences among the nurse practitioners in data collection, diagnostic accuracy or patient outcome. The diagnoses were correct in 92 percent, incorrect in 6 percent and indeterminate in 2 percent of the patients. Incorrect diagnoses were due to presumption of urinary tract infection in patients with the <b>urethral</b> <b>syndrome</b> or vaginitis. Of the patients, 78 percent were actually sent home without seeing a physician. Concordance with the nurse practitioners' physical examination was 100 percent in those patients examined by a physician. In 82 percent of the patients there was alleviation of symptoms. Patient satisfaction with this method of care was extraordinary, with 98 percent of the patients giving favorable reports. True physician extension was achieved with a reduction in physician time per patient from 20 minutes to 6 minutes. In contrast to previously reported data, only a modest reduction in salary cost savings (10 percent) could be shown. The author concludes that nurse practitioners working in an acute care clinic or emergency department can see the patients defined in the study and provide high-quality care at a reasonable cost...|$|E
