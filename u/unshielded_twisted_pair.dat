25|$|<b>Unshielded</b> <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> (UTP) cables {{are found}} in many Ethernet {{networks}} and telephone systems. For indoor telephone applications, UTP is often grouped into sets of 25 pairs according to a standard 25-pair color code originally developed by AT Corporation. A typical subset of these colors (white/blue, blue/white, white/orange, orange/white) shows up in most UTP cables. The cables are typically made with copper wires measured at 22 or 24 American Wire Gauge (AWG), with the colored insulation typically made from an insulator such as polyethylene or FEP and the total package covered in a polyethylene jacket.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Development of cables for {{structured}} cabling systems based on <b>twisted</b> <b>pairs</b> for shipbuilding {{is carried out}} in two main directions: increasing the fire safety of cables and increasing the long-term permissible operating temperature by using new, more heat-resistant, electrical insulating materials. Purpose. Substantiation {{of the possibility of}} unshielded cables on the basis of <b>unshielded</b> <b>twisted</b> <b>pairs</b> with thermoplastic polyethylene insulation in PVC protective jacket in conditions of high humidity and high operating temperatures {{on the basis of the}} results of accelerated aging. Methodology. The cycle of aging under conditions of increased humidity is performed for 336 hours. Then the sample was under natural drying conditions for 1440 hours. Thermal aging in a thermostat at 90 °C was carried out in two stages: first – for 206 hours, the second – for 260 hours. In the initial state and after accelerated aging, measurements of the capacitance and tangent of the dielectric loss angle of all the insulating gaps at frequencies of 100 Hz, 1 and 10 kHz were performed. Results. According to the results of accelerated aging under conditions of high humidity and temperature, it is established that the design of an unshielded cable based on <b>unshielded</b> <b>twisted</b> <b>pairs</b> with thermoplastic polyethylene insulation in a protective coating based on PVC-plastic is resistant to external influencing factors. Practical value. The prolonged holding at temperature of 90 °C is equivalent to operation at temperature of 40 °C for 6. 8 years. At higher operating temperatures, the lifetime of the cable is significantly reduced...|$|R

50|$|Most {{copper wires}} used in data {{communications}} today have eight strands of copper, organized in <b>unshielded</b> <b>twisted</b> <b>pairs,</b> or UTP.

In addition to UTP, some wires use shielded <b>twisted</b> <b>pairs</b> (STP), which reduce electrical interference even further. The way copper wires are twisted around one another {{also has an}} effect on data rates. Category 3 cable (Cat3), has three to four twists per foot and can support speeds of 10 Mbit/s. Category 5 cable (Cat5) is newer and has three to four twists per inch, which results in a maximum data rate of 100 Mbit/s. In addition, there are category 5e (Cat5e) cables which can support speeds of up to 1,000 Mbit/s, and more recently, category 6 cables (Cat6), which support data rates of up to 10,000 Mbit/s (or 10 Gbit/s).|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a rapidly {{converging}} LMS algorithm for crosstalk cancellation. The architecture is similar to deep neural networks, where multiple layers are adapted sequentially. The application motivating this approach is gigabit rate transmission over <b>unshielded</b> <b>twisted</b> <b>pairs</b> using a vectored system. The crosstalk cancellation algorithm uses an adaptive non-diagonal preprocessing matrix prior to a conventional LMS crosstalk canceler. The update of the preprocessing matrix is inspired by deep neural networks. However, since most the operations in the Deep-LMS algorithm are linear, we are capable of providing an exact convergence speed analysis. The role of the preprocessing matrix is to speed up the convergence of the conventional LMS crosstalk canceler and hence the convergence of the overall system. The Deep-LMS is important for crosstalk cancellation in the novel G. fast standard, where traditional LMS converges very slowly due to the ill-conditioned covariance matrix of the received signal at the extended bandwidth. Simulation results support our analysis and show significant reduction in convergence time compared to existing LMS variants...|$|R

40|$|Carrierless {{amplitude}} and phase (CAP) modulation {{is generally}} regarded as a bandwidth efficient two-dimensional (2 -D) passband line code. It {{is closely related to}} the pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) schemes. CAP has been proposed for various digital subscriber loop (DSL) systems over <b>unshielded</b> <b>twisted</b> <b>pairs</b> of copper wires. In this thesis, our main focus is on the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) performance of the ideal (i. e., infinite length) linear and non-linear (decision feedback) CAP receivers/equalisers in the presence of additive, coloured Gaussian noise, and/or data-like cross-talks. An in-depth analysis is given on the performance of both receiver structures. In the case of the linear receiver, one possible view of the overall CAP transceiver system which includes both data and cross-talk transmission paths {{is that it is a}} linear multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Accordingly, the existing MMSE results for a general MIMO system are applicable also to CAP systems. However, up to date, this approach was shown to be unsuccessful in the sense that the derived MMSE expressions are too complex and offer little insights. In our analysis, in order to find a more incisive MMSE expression, we reconsider the problem of minimisation of the MSEs at slicers. By exploiting the Hilbert transform pair relationship between the impulse responses of the inphase and quadrature transmit shaping filters, we are able to obtain an elegant and more meaningful MMSE expression, as well as the corresponding transfer functions of the optimum linear receive filters. In the case of the nonlinear, or decision feedback equaliser (DFE), receiver, we start our analysis with the receiver structure of a generic multidimensional (>/= 3) CAP-type system. This receiver consists of a bank of analog receive filters, the number of which equals the dimension of the CAP line code, and a matrix of cross-connected, infinite-length, baud-spaced feedback filters. It is shown that the optimum filters and the corresponding MMSE of the DFE receiver require the factorisation of a discrete-time channel spectral matrix. This mathematically intractable step can be avoided, however, when the DFE results are specialised to a standard 2 -D CAP system where we are able to again exploit the Hilbert transform pair relationship to derive a further and more useful MMSE expression. Three sets of numerical studies are given on the MMSE performance of the CAP receivers. In the first set of studies. we model the sum of all crosstalks as an additive, Gaussian noise source and select three test transmission channels over which we compare the MMSE performance of the linear and DFE receiver structures. In the second set of studies, we compare the performance of the two receiver structures, but in a data-like cross-talk environment. The results demonstrate the importance of NEXT equalisation in the design of CAP receivers operating in a NEXT dominant environment. In the final set of studies which follows from the second set of studies, we investigate the relationship between the MMSE performance of the DFE receiver and system parameters which include excess bandwidth, data rate, CAP scheme. and relative phase between the received signal and the NEXT signal. The results show that data-like cross-talks can be effectively suppressed by using a large excess bandwidth (alpha > 1 in the case of a RC transmit shaping filter) alone. The relative phase also affect; the receiver performance. but to a lesser degree. In addition to the MMSE performance analysis. implementation issues of an adaptive linear CAP receiver are also considered. We propose a novel linear receiver by appending two fixed analog filters to the front-end of the existing adaptive linear receiver using fractionally-spaced equalisers (FSE). We show that if the analog filters are matched to the transmit shaping filters, then inphase and quadrature finite-length FSEs in the proposed receiver have the same NINISE solution. We further propose a modified least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm which takes advantage of this feature. The convergence analysis of the proposed LMS algorithm is also given. We show that the modified LMS algorithm converges approximately twice as fast as the standard LMS algorithm, given the same misadjustment, or alternatively, it halves the misadjustment, given the same initial convergence rate...|$|R
