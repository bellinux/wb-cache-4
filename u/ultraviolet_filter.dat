This increasing world-wide phenomenon is associated with temperature anomalies, high irradiance, pollution, and bacterial diseases. Recently, it has been demonstrated that personal can products, including sunscreens, {{have an impact on}} aquatic organisms similar to that of other contaminants. Objectives: Our goal was to evaluate the potential impact of sunscreen ingredients on hard corals and their symbiotic algae. Methods: In situ and laboratory experiments were conducted in several tropical regions (the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, and the Red Sea) by supplementing coral branches with aliquots of sunscreens and common <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>filters</b> contained in sunscreen formula. Zooxanthellae were checked for viral infection by epifluorescence and transmission electron microscopy analyses.

In this study we investigate the altering of both the structure and physical properties through the doping of hematite (a-Fe 203) nanocrystals with cerium at a range of concentrations, synthesised using a one-pot co-precipitation method.

Here, we report effects on male development. METHODS: 4 -MBC (0. 7, 7, 24, 47 mg/kg/day) was administered in chow to the parent generation before mating, during gestation and lactation, and to offspring until adulthood. mRNA was determined in prostate lobes by real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and protein was determined by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: 4 -MBC delayed male puberty, decreased adult prostate weight, and slightly increased testis weight. Androgen receptor (AR), insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1), ER-α, and ER-β expression in prostate were altered at mRNA and protein levels, with stronger effects in dorsolateral than ventral prostate. To assess sensitivity of target genes to estrogens, offspring were castrated on postnatal day 70, injected with 17 β-estradiol (E 2; 10 or 50 µg/kg, sc) or vehicle on postnatal day 84, and sacrificed 6 hr later.

Little {{is known about the}} reason for octocrylene's allergenic activity. Objectives. To present and discuss the results of patch tests and photopatch tests with octocrylene, and to investigate the possible cause of its allergenic properties. Methods. Results of patch tests and photopatch tests with octocrylene in patients with adverse skin reactions to sunscreen products and/or ketoprofen were collected. The allergenic potency of octocrylene was investigated in the murine local lymph node assay (LLNA). Chemical reactivity assays were used to mimic octocrylene's interaction with biomolecules. Results. We report 23 cases {{of positive}} test reactions to octocrylene (5 patch test and 18 photopatch). Notably, many of these patients also had positive photopatch test reactions to ketoprofen and benzophenone- 3. Octocrylene was shown to be a moderate sensitizer in the LLNA, and it reacted with amines such as lysine, but not with thiols such as cysteine. Conclusions. The clinical studies show that octocrylene is both a photocontact allergen and a contact allergen. Octocrylene's ability to cause contact allergy is probably attributable to its reactivity towards lysine.

METHODS: This prospective randomized bilateral double-masked clinical study included 52 patients with visually significant bilateral cataracts divided in two groups; 25 patients (50 eyes) received aspherical intraocular lens {{in one eye}} and spherical intraocular lens in the fellow eye; and 27 patients (54 eyes) received ultraviolet and blue light filter (yellow tinted) IOL implantation in one eye and acrylic <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>filter</b> IOL in the fellow eye.

However, in a standard entrainment experiment ground squirrels show no entrainment to ultraviolet light, while Syrian hamsters do entrain under the same protocol.
