Por sua vez, a produção de matéria seca das duas frações da planta daninha não foi influenciada pela variação do pH. Comparativamente, o capim-marandu apresentou maior habilidade para absorver nutrientes em pH 6, 5, enquanto a malva apresentou maior habilidade em condições de pH extremo (3, 5 e 6, 5). Independentemente do pH da solução nutritiva e da parte da planta analisada, os teores de fósforo, potássio, cálcio e magnésio foram, quase sempre, mais elevados na planta daninha do que no capim-marandu, demonstrando que a malva apresenta maior habilidade para extrair esses nutrientes do solo.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess ten plants from the Congolese {{pharmacopoeia}} for their analgesic activity as well as their cytotoxicity, in order to validate their traditional use. Thirty-three extracts were obtained in 3 different solvents (Water, Ethanol, DCM) from these ten plants selected after an ethnobotanic survey in the region of the Pool (Congo Brazzaville) : Leonotis nepetaefolia (Lamiaceae), Manotes pruinosa (Connaraceae), Spilanthes uliginosa (Asteraceae), Hymenocardia ulmoides (Euphorbiaceae), Celosia trigyna (Amaranthaceae), Cogniauxia podolaena (Cucurbitaceae), Brillantaisia patula (Acanthaceae), <b>Urena</b> <b>lobata</b> (Malvaceae), Mitracarpus scaber (Rubiaceae), Triumfetta rhomboidea (Tiliaceae). The writhing test (Siegmund Chemical Test) was used for the pharmacological screening. The cytotoxicity of all the extracts was tested on KB (Human epidermoid carcinoma) and Vero (African green monkey kidney) cell lines with taxotere as positive control. A TLC chemical screening of the extracts was carried out to detect the major chemical classes present in the plants. The data of the traditional medicine were confirmed, since eight plants out of ten were active, aqueous and ethanolic extracts being the most active. Moreover, only C. podolaena leaf extracts were cytotoxic (87 % of inhibition on KB). This work opens the way for the research of the active molecules from these plants and for their use as leads in the synthesis and the pharmacomodulation of compounds with analgesic potentiality...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the aqueous root extract of <b>urena</b> <b>lobata</b> on the rat liver was {{investigated}} using a total of (25) adult Wister rats of both sexes that were randomly divided into five groups of five rats each. Group I served as the control, while rats in groups II-IV where administered 100, 200 and 300 mg/kg body weight of the extract, respectively for 28 days. Rats in group V were administered 300 mg/kg of the extract for 28 days and allowed to stay for 14 days post treatment to observe for reversibility, persistence or delayed occurrence of toxic effects. At {{the end of the}} experimental period the animals were sacrificed and liver weight taken and fixed for routine histological examinations. Administration of the extract to rats had no effects on liver and body weights but the extract caused a decrease in albumin level and increases in the levels of Aspartate Transaminases (AST), Alanine Transaminases (ALT) and Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP). Histopathological assessment of the liver revealed mild to severe interstitial hemorrhage, mononuclear cell infiltration, necrosis, congestion and edema in the liver of the treated rats while withdrawal of the extract for 14 days showed a slight degree of recovery in the rats. This findings suggest that the biochemical and morphological organization of the liver can significantly be altered with continues and increase use of the extract, but further studies on the long term effect of the extract and a prolonged recovery period is recommended in further studies...|$|E

As the subject Ethno pediatric medicinal plants are very poorly known, therefore the present ethnopediatric information may prove helpful for further scientific studies. In recent years no valuable study has been made out on ethnopediatric medicinal plants. The number of informats such as local traditional medicinal practitioners and knowledgeable elders has provided the information in frequent field visits to this place. Total number of 20 plant species belonging to 15 families has been enumerated with scientific names families; uses and locality of use. The tribals are, by nature, reluctant {{to go to the}} hospital and have a great faith and insist on their own traditional system of medicine. Still the tribals use these plants frequently to cure diseases. The knowledge of this traditional medicine is intact in this region and they use this knowledge mostly for their daily requirements, due to lack of modern facilities. The tribals are very conservative in nature and they do not easily mixed up with other communities for exchange or to share their empirical knowledge...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} the incretin effects of <b>Urena</b> <b>lobata</b> leaves extract on the structure and function of rats islet β-cells. This study utilizes male Sprague-Dawley rats divided into 2 control group and 3 test group (n =  5). Diabetic rats were induced with High Fructose Diet (HFD) and single dose intraperitoneal streptozotocin 25  mg/kg bw. Aqueous leaves extract of U.  lobata was prepared by decoction methods and administrated orally with doses of 250, 500, and 1000  mg/kg bw for 4 weeks then incretin effect was evaluated by measuring serum GLP- 1, insulin, and blood glucose levels. Histology of islet β-cells was evaluated using photomicroscopy by analyzing size, shape, and number. Data were analyzed using ANOVA test followed by LSD test and p ≤  0. 05 is considered significant. Oral administration of aqueous extract U.  lobata leaves at doses of 250, 500, and 1000  mg/kg body weight were able to prolong GLP- 1 bioavailability by 3 -fold, 5 -fold, and 7 -fold respectively {{when compared to the}} diabetic group whereas blood glucose level were decreased about 30 %, 35 %, and 40 % respectively (p <  0. 05). Extract at doses of 500 and 1000  mg/kg bw also increased insulin level by 4 -fold and 8 -fold respectively compared to the diabetic group and the islet β-cells were repaired. The active compound in U.  lobata leaves extract are suggested to prevent degradation of GLP- 1 by inhibition of DPP- 4 activity. Aqueous extract of U.  lobata also improved the structure and function of islet β-cells by increasing of GLP- 1 bioavailability...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} the possible antifertility activity of Enicostemma axillare (E. axillare) leaves and <b>Urena</b> <b>lobata</b> (U. lobata) root in adult male Wistar albino rats. MethodsSix groups of rats {{were treated with}} ethanolic (70 %v/v) extracts of E. axillare (375 and 750 mg/kg body weight) and U. lobata root (300 and 600 mg/kg body weight) once daily for 55 days. Control groups received the distilled water and vehicle. All the treated rats had corresponding recovery groups. At {{the end of each}} treatment periods, animals were killed and organ weights, sperm characteristics, testicular and epididymal biochemicals as well as testicular enzymes were assessed. ResultsThe E. axillare and U. lobata at tested doses did not decrease body weight, whereas the weight of testes, epididymides and seminal vesicles were significantly (P< 0. 01) reduced. Significantly (P< 0. 01) more reductions in the sperm motility, viability and counts, epididymal and testicular protein contents were noted in the rats treated with higher dose of both the plants. Both the plants at the higher dose caused a marked increase (P< 0. 01) in sperm morphological abnormalities, testicular cholesterol and ascorbic acid contents were remarkably increased (P< 0. 01), while, the activities of testicular glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G- 6 -PDH) and Δ 5 - 3 β-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase (Δ 5 - 3 β-HSD) were significantly reduced (P< 0. 01). However, reversal of these changes occurred after 55 days of treatment withdrawal. ConclusionsThis study suggests that the E. axillare leaves and U. lobata root reversibly inhibited spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis indicating reversible antifertility activity which could partially support the traditional of these plants as male contraceptives...|$|E
40|$|<b>Urena</b> <b>lobata</b> is {{becoming}} a noxious and invasive weed in rangelands, pastures, and undisturbed areas in the Philippines. This study determined the effects of seed scarification, light, salt and water stress, amount of rice residue, and seed burial depth on seed germination and emergence of U. lobata; and evaluated the weed’s response to post-emergence herbicides. Germination was stimulated by both mechanical and chemical seed scarifications. The {{combination of the two}} scarification methods provided maximum (99 %) seed germination. Germination was slightly stimulated when seeds were placed in light (65 %) compared with when seeds were kept in the dark (46 %). Sodium chloride concentrations ranging from 0 to 200 mM and osmotic potential ranging from 0 to 21. 6 MPa affected the germination of U. lobata seeds significantly. The osmotic potential required for 50 % inhibition of the maximum germination was 20. 1 MPa; however, some seeds germinated at 20. 8 MPa, but none germinated at 21. 6 MPa. Seedling emergence and biomass increased with increase in rice residue amount up to 4 t ha 21, but declined beyond this amount. Soil surface placement of weed seeds resulted in the highest seedling emergence (84 %), which declined with increase in burial depth. The burial depth required for 50 % inhibition of maximum emergence was 2 cm; emergence was greatly reduced (93 %) at burial depth of 4 cm or more. Weed seedling biomass also decreased with increase in burial depth. Bispyribac-sodium, a commonly used herbicide in rice, sprayed at the 4 -leaf stage of the weed, provided 100 % control, which did not differ much with 2, 4 -D (98 %), glyphosate (97 %), an...|$|E
