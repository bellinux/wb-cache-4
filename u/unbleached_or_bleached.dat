Whole-wheat flour is used in baking of breads and other baked goods, and also typically mixed with other lighter [...] "white" [...] <b>unbleached</b> <b>or</b> <b>bleached</b> flours (that have been treated with flour bleaching agent(s)) to restore nutrients to the white flours (especially fiber, protein, and vitamins), texture, and body that are lost in milling and other processing to the finished baked goods or other food(s).|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Sapwood and {{heartwood}} groundwood {{samples were}} prepared separately {{from a second}} growth, coastal range, young Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco). The bleaching responses of these two groundwoods to zinc hydrosulfite were examined, and the roles of both dihydroquercetin and quercetin in this bleaching reaction were investigated. Heartwood groundwood was identified to be the major culprit in the bleaching of Douglas-fir groundwood. For this particular sample, the bleachability of its heartwood groundwood was inversely linearly proportional to the pulp freeness at the lower freeness levels. The addition of pure dihydroquercetin to sapwood groundwood had a minor effect on both brightness and bleachability of this groundwood, but the addition of quercetin resulted not only in decreased unbleached brightness but also in insignificant brightness gain during groundwood bleaching with zinc hydrosulfite. Paper and gas chromatographies were employed for the quantitative determinations of dihydroquercetin present in heartwood groundwoods treated in various ways, such as bleaching and/or aging. The brightnesses and bleachabilities of these heartwood groundwoods showed poor correlation with their dihydroquercetin contents. The effect of aging and the bleached brightness reversion were similar for both sapwood and heartwood groundwoods. Solvent extractions did not improve either the <b>unbleached</b> <b>or</b> <b>bleached</b> brightness of heartwood groundwood. No commercially feasible method of improving the brightness of Douglas-fir heartwood groundwood to a commercially acceptable level has been developed in this research...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{that control the}} natural rate of lipofuscin accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell and its stability over time are not well understood. Similarly, the contributions of retinoids, phospholipids and oxidation to the rate of accumulation of lipofuscin are uncertain. The experiments {{in this study were}} conducted to explore the individual contribution of rod outer segments (ROS) components to lipofuscin formation and its accumulation and stability over time. During the period of 14 days incubation of ROS, lipofuscin-like autofluorescence (LLAF) determined at two wavelengths (530 and 585 nm) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was measured from RPE cells. The autofluorescence increased in an exponential manner with a strong linear component between days 1 and 7. The magnitude of the increase was larger in cells incubated with 4 -hydroxynonenal (HNE-ROS) compared with cells incubated with either bleached or unbleached ROS, but with a different spectral profile. A small (10 - 15 %) decrease in LLAF was observed after stopping the ROS feeding for 14 days. The phagocytosis rate of HNE-ROS was higher than that of either bleached or unbleached ROS during the first 24 h of supplementation. Among the different ROS components, the increase of LLAF was highest in cells incubated with all-trans-retinal. Surprisingly, incubation with 11 -cis-retinal and 9 -cis-retinal also resulted in strong LLAF increase, comparable to the increase induced by all-trans-retinal. Supplementation with liposomes containing phosphatidylethanolamine (22 : 6 -PE) and phosphatidylcholine (18 : 1 -PC) also increased LLAF, while incubation with opsin had little effect. Cells incubated with retinoids demonstrated strong dose-dependence in LLAF increase, and the magnitude of the increase was 2 - 3 times higher at 585 nm compared to 530 nm, while cells incubated with liposomes showed little dose-dependence and similar increase at both wavelengths. Very little difference in LLAF was noted between cells incubated with either <b>unbleached</b> <b>or</b> <b>bleached</b> ROS under any conditions. In summary, results from this study suggest that supplementation with various ROS components can lead to an increase in LLAF, although the autofluorescence generated by the different classes of components has distinct spectral profiles, where the autofluorescence induced by retinoids results in a spectral profile closest to the one observed from human lipofuscin. Future fluorescence characterization of LLAF in vitro would benefit from an analysis of multiple wavelengths to better match the spectral characteristics of lipofuscin in vivo...|$|E
40|$|By {{removing}} the primary fines from an oxygen-delignified mill birch pulp, a fiber fraction was obtained having low metals content and no extractives. After DEDeD bleaching the fiber fraction had somewhat higher brightness and better brightness stability than the birch pulp containing the primary fines. The fines fraction was enriched with lignin, extractives, xylan, and metals. Bleaching the fines fraction in a QQP sequence {{did not affect}} the extractives, whereas a ZeQP sequence clearly reduced the extractives content. In a biorefinery concept, the fines fraction could be utilized as a source of xylan, fatty acids, sterols, and betulinol. Another possibility is to use the fines fraction <b>unbleached</b> <b>or</b> separately <b>bleached</b> as a bonding material in various fiber furnishes...|$|R
40|$|Extraction of house-fly {{heads with}} neutral {{phosphate}} buffer yielded a dark brown solution {{from which a}} number of pigments were separated, either wholly or partially, by chromatography on a column of calcium phosphate mixed with celite. One of the pigments was light-sensitive, and had a yellow color, with a spectral absorption maximum at 437 m/z in phosphate buffer at pH 6. 5. Several consecutively eluted fractions from each chromatogram of the house-fly head extract showed the characteristic absorption curve of this pigment with no trace, spectroscopically, of the other pigments of the extract. The products of bleaching the pigment at pH 6. 5 had an absorption curve showing plateaus at 440 to 460 m ~ and 350 to 360 m/ ~ and an inflection at about 250 m/~. Above pH 8. 0 the pigment bleached in the dark giving an absorption maximum at about 380 m~, and inflections at 290 mp and at about 250 m~. With 2. 5 to 5 N HC 1 or H 2504 an absorption maximum at 470 to 475 m ~ was obtained with either the <b>unbleached</b> <b>or</b> the <b>bleached</b> pigment. With sulfosalicylic acid, ethanol, or heating at 100 Â°C., {{a part of the}} pigment was precipitated, leaving a light-stable yellow supernatant. This light-sensitive house-fly pigment cannot as yet be identified with any of the previously known insect pigments or with the photosensitive pigments of other animals, though these latter compounds exhibit some similarity in their spectroscopic properties...|$|R
