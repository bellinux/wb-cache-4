The program also included training them to carry equipment and material to divers working underwater by holding cameras in their mouths to locate lost objects, survey ships and submarines, and underwater monitoring. A similar program was used by the Russian Navy during the Cold War, in which belugas were also trained for antimining operations in the Arctic.|$|E

The cataphract was a type of heavily armoured cavalry with distinct tactics, armour, and weaponry <b>used</b> <b>from</b> the time of the Persians up until the Middle Ages.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, {{following}} the accession of George V, the florin regained the shields and sceptres design {{it had in}} the late Victorian Era, and kept that motif until 1937, when the national emblems were placed on it. The florin retained such a theme for the remainder of its run, though a new design was <b>used</b> <b>from</b> 1953, {{following the}} accession of Elizabeth II. In 1968, prior to decimalisation, the Royal Mint began striking the ten pence piece.
