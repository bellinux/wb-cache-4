5|$|Professor Onassis, {{who invented}} the time machine in the 1800s, arrives in the {{original}} version of the machine soon after and future Candace steals it. She travels back to the day the boys built the rollercoaster in their backyard and succeeds in getting her mother to see them, finally fulfilling her dream of busting them. However, in doing so, she accidentally leads Perry, their pet platypus who is secretly a suave secret agent, to be injured while stopping an evil magnet mechanism. As a result, Perry's nemesis, Dr. Doofenshmirtz, comes out unharmed {{from the effects of}} the now-destroyed machine. Over time, everything is altered and the Tri-State Area becomes childproof for fear of a repeat of Phineas and Ferb's dangerous activities. Doofenshmirtz eventually gains the upper hand, effectively becoming the ruler. He claims to be a nice Emperor, though, since he can remember everyone's name (though this is considerably easier than it seems, since one of his rules is that everyone has to be named Joe and requires everyone to wear lab coats at all times). Also, because of Doofenshmirtz succeeding, the Agency is now forced into a oath to obey him, resulting a demoralized Perry to fail more on his missions against Doofenshmirtz and is forbidden to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> machine that Candace previously used as suggested by Major Monogram. After arriving in the dystopian future Doofenshmirtz rules, Candace finds the time machine in a junk yard and returns to the day of the rollercoaster to stop herself from interfering like before, stopping the dystopia from occurring.|$|E
25|$|Beatty's conduct {{during the}} next 15 minutes has {{received}} {{a great deal of}} criticism, as his ships out-ranged and outnumbered the German squadron, yet he held his fire for over 10 minutes with the German ships in range. He also failed to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> available to rearrange his battlecruisers into a fighting formation, with the result that they were still manoeuvring when the battle started.|$|E

25|$|The eldest male at {{the table}} was always served first, {{commonly}} served {{to them in the}} men's quarters by the women of the house. Women usually dined in a separate portion of the house after the men were served. The eldest men or women always ate before the younger family members. The meal was usually quiet, as conversation was discouraged during meals. In modern times, these rules have become lax, as families usually dine together now and <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to converse. Of the remaining elements of this decorum, one is that the younger members of the table should not pick up their chopsticks or start eating before the elders of the table or guests and should not finish eating before the elders or guests finish eating.|$|E

He reattaches the levers before he travels further ahead to roughly 30 million years from his own time. There he sees some of the last living things on a dying Earth: menacing reddish crab-like creatures slowly wandering the blood-red beaches chasing enormous butterflies in a world covered in simple lichenous vegetation. He continues to make short jumps through time, seeing Earth's rotation gradually cease and the sun grow larger, redder, and dimmer, and the world falling silent and freezing as the last degenerate living things die out.|$|E
25|$|German ships had {{to report}} their {{position}} every night by wireless and listening posts built along the British east coast took cross-bearings to find the positions of German ships when they transmitted. The intelligence meant that the British did not need wasteful defensive standing patrols and sweeps of the North Sea. The British could economise on fuel and <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> for training and maintenance. The Admiralty also uncovered the German order of battle and tracked the deployment of ships, which gave them an offensive advantage. The lack of a proper war staff at the Admiralty and poor liaison between Room 40, Oliver and the operations staff, meant that the advantage was poorly exploited in 1915. (It was not until 1917 that this was remedied.) When German ships sailed, information from Room 40 needed to be passed on quickly but Oliver {{found it hard to}} delegate and would not routinely supply all decrypts. Oliver's reticence meant that the Admiralty supplied commanders at sea only what the Admiralty thought they needed, risking information reaching the Grand Fleet late, being incomplete or mistakenly interpreted. When Jellicoe asked for a decryption section to take to sea, it was refused on security grounds.|$|E

500|$|When time stutters occur, the game's visual {{changes to}} inform players {{that they will}} {{encounter}} new enemies and obstacles. The levels in the game were designed to feature open environments to allow players to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> manipulation powers freely and encouraging them to explore. Kyle Rowley, lead designer of the game, described them as [...] "arenas". The stutters were also designed to convey stories: Players can inspect the non-playable characters stuck in a time stutter and learn {{about what happened to}} them when time freezes. To prevent the game from relying excessively on its cover system, the artificial intelligence (AI) of the game was designed to attack the player aggressively in order to drive the player out from cover. Time powers affect AI behaviors, and Remedy built a new system that allows the AI to search for the player character after Time Rush is used.|$|E

Rather than <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to rest, lead vocalist Bono and guitarist The Edge were keen to record new material. Following a hectic year of touring, the two {{did not want to}} settle back into domestic life. Bono said, [...] "We thought we could live a normal life and then go back on the road [...] But it turns out that your whole way of thinking, your whole body has been geared toward the madness of Zoo TV... So we decided to put the madness on a record. Everybody's head was spinning, so we thought, why not keep that momentum going...?" [...] The Edge also wished to distract himself from the emotions he was feeling after separating from his wife during the Achtung Baby sessions in 1991. The other members, bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen, Jr., ultimately agreed to join them for recording.|$|E
500|$|In 1816 Maxwell {{was ordered}} to escort Lord Amherst on a {{diplomatic}} mission to the Jiaqing Emperor of China. Alceste was accompanied by the small sloop HMS Lyra, under Captain Basil Hall, and the East Indiaman General Hewitt, which carried gifts for the Emperor. The small convoy called at Madeira, Rio de Janeiro, Cape Town, Anjere and Batavia, and arrived at Peiho after nearly six months at sea in July. Amherst went ashore with his party, instructing Maxwell {{to meet him at}} Canton once his diplomatic mission was complete. The mission was expected to last several months, so Maxwell and Hall agreed to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to become the first British sailors to explore the Yellow Sea and beyond. Between them, Lyra and Alceste visited the Gulf of Pecheli, the West coast of Korea and the [...] "Loo-Choo" [...] (Ryukyu) Islandsin some cases as the first European ships known to have sailed these waters. During the journey, Maxwell saw the Great Wall of China and discovered serious inaccuracies in the charts of Western Korea, finding it lay 130miles east of its supposed position. The expedition also made the first known British government contacts with both the Koreans and the Ryukyu Islanders, who ignored instructions from Chinese officials not to communicate with the British ships.|$|E
500|$|The unarmed first {{prototype}} first flew on 27 February 1942 {{using the}} Sabre II, {{the first of}} two armed prototypes following on 15 July. The initial flight trials were a disappointment as the aircraft could only reach [...] below Blackburn's estimated maximum speed. Replacement of the Sabre II with a Sabre III (an engine built specifically for the Firebrand) improved its top speed to [...] at 17,000 ft (5,182 m). The second prototype, DD810, conducted deck-landing trials, with Commander Dennis Cambell at the controls, aboard the fleet carrier [...] in February 1943. The Sabre engine was also used in the Hawker Typhoon, a fighter already in production and the Ministry of Air Production (MAP) decided that the Typhoon had priority for the Sabre. The Sabre was also experiencing production problems and so a new engine was needed, along with the necessary airframe adaptations. To <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> and effort invested in the design, the MAP decided to convert the Firebrand into an interim strike fighter, to meet a Fleet Air Arm requirement for a single-seat torpedo bomber capable of carrying bombs, rockets and being capable of air-to-air combat. Nine production F. Mk I aircraft were built to the original specifications and were retained for trials and development work.|$|E

500|$|My Bloody Valentine were {{scheduled}} to record at Blackwing Studios in Southwark, London {{for the month of}} February 1989, and intended to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to conceptualise a new, more studio-based sound for their second album. Shields said that Creation first believed the album could be recorded [...] "in five days". According to Shields [...] "when it became clear that wasn't going to happen, they [...] freaked." [...] After several unproductive months, the band relocated in September to the basement studio The Elephant and Wapping, where they spent eight unproductive weeks. In-house engineer Nick Robbins said Shields made it clear from the outset that he (Robbins) [...] "was just there to press the buttons." [...] Robbins was quickly replaced by Harold Burgon, but according to Shields, Burgon's main contribution was to show the group how to use the in-studio computer. Burgon and Shields spent three weeks at the Woodcray studio in Berkshire working on the Glider EP, which Shields and Creation owner Alan McGee agreed would be released in advance of the album. Alan Moulder was hired to mix the Glider song [...] "Soon" [...] at Trident 2 studio in Victoria (the song would reappear as the closing track on Loveless). Shields said of Moulder, [...] "As soon as we worked with him we realized we'd love to some more!" [...] When the group returned to work on the album Moulder was the sole engineer Shields trusted enough to perform tasks such as miking the amplifiers; all the other credited engineers were told [...] "We're so on top of this you don't even have to come to work." [...] Shields has since stated that [...] "these engineers—with the exception of Alan Moulder and later Anjali Dutt—were all just the people who came with the studio...everything we wanted to do was wrong, according to them", although the band did give credit on the album sleeve to anyone who was present during the recordings, [...] "even if all they did was fix tea", according to Shields.|$|E
