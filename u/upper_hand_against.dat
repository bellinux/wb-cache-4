5|$|The Battle of the Netherlands {{commenced}} on 10 May 1940. While initial {{air operations}} went well, and the German fighters and bombers soon gained the <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> the small Dutch air force, the paratroopers ran into fierce {{opposition in the}} Battle for The Hague and the Battle of Rotterdam. On 14 May 1940, responding to a call for assistance from Student, Kesselring ordered the bombing of Rotterdam city centre. Fires raged out of control, destroying much of the city.|$|E
500|$|Although in the {{previous}} years the Venetians had generally held the <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> the Ottomans, largely controlling the Aegean and able to extract tribute and recruits from its islands, they {{had been unable to}} transform this superiority into concrete results. Despite their defeats, the Ottomans were still free to roam the Aegean and resupply their forces in Crete, in particular through the use of supply fleets from places like Alexandria, Rhodes, Chios or Monemvasia in the Peloponnese. In June 1656 however, a combined Venetian–Maltese fleet of 67 ships under Marcello inflicted on the Ottomans, with 108 ships under Kenan Pasha, their [...] "worst naval defeat since Lepanto": Sixty Ottoman ships were destroyed and 24 captured and 5,000 Christian galley slaves set free, although the Venetians and Maltese suffered some casualties too, including the loss of Captain General Marcello. Although in the aftermath of this victory the Maltese contingent departed, the scale of their success enabled the Venetians under Barbado Doer to seize Tenedos on 8 July and Lemnos on 20 August. Using the two islands, strategically located near the entrance of the Straits, as forward bases, the Venetian blockade became much more effective. As a result, the resupply of Crete was effectively cut off, and Constantinople itself suffered a shortage of food during the following winter.|$|E
500|$|By June 1813 Belgrano {{set up a}} base in Potosí with an army of 2,500 men, {{to prepare}} an attack on Upper Peru. Goyeneche moved to Oruro and resigned, being {{replaced}} by Joaquín de la Pezuela. Belgrano administrated the zone and tried to revert the bad impression left by the previous campaign of Juan José Castelli. Belgrano initiated {{good relations with the}} natives as well. Belgrano's plan was to attack the royalists from the front and the sides, with the aid of the armies of Cárdenas and Zelaya. Both armies were near 3,500 men. However, the royalists obtained an important advantage by defeating Cárdenas and getting possession of his papers, which gave them insight into the patriotic plans. Belgrano was taken by surprise at Vilcapugio on 1 October, and initially gained the <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> the royalist troops, who started to flee. However, when Pezuela saw that the patriotic armies were not following, he reorganised his forces, returned to the battle, and won. There were barely 400 survivors. Belgrano said: [...] "Soldiers: we have lost the battle after so much fighting. Victory has betrayed us by going to the enemy ranks during our triumph. It does not matter! The flag of the nation still swings in our hands!". After gathering his army at Macha, where he received reinforcements from Cochabamba, Belgrano was ready for another engagement with Pezuela, whose troops were not in a better situation. On 14 November, Belgrano was again vanquished by the royalists at Ayohuma, and was forced to withdraw the remains of his army towards Potosí and from there to Jujuy.|$|E

5000|$|The Muslims' light cavalry {{during the}} later {{years of the}} Islamic conquest of Levant became the most {{powerful}} section of the army. The best use of this lightly armed and fast moving cavalry was revealed at the Battle of Yarmouk (636 A.D) in which Khalid ibn Walid, knowing the importance and ability of his cavalry, used them to turn the tables at every critical instance of the battle with their ability to engage and disengage and turn back and attack again from the flank or rear. A strong cavalry regiment was formed by Khalid ibn Walid which included the veterans of the campaign in Iraq and Syria. Early Muslim historians have given it the name mutaharrik tulaiha( [...] متحرك طليعة [...] ), or the mobile guard. This {{was used as an}} advance guard and a strong striking force to route the opposing armies with its greater mobility that gave it an <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> when maneuvering <b>against</b> any Byzantine army. With this mobile striking force, the conquest of Syria was made easy.|$|R
2500|$|Du {{claimed the}} title of Qa´id Jami al-Muslimin ("Leader of the Community of Muslims"). He was known in English as the Sultan of Dali upon the city's capture. It became the base for the rebels, who {{declared}} themselves [...] "Pingnan" [...] ( [...] , lit."The Pacified South"). The rebels besieged the city of Kunming four times (1857, 1861, 1863, and 1868) and briefly held the city during the third attempt. Later, as Qing forces began to gain the <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> the rebellion, the rebels {{sent a letter to}} Queen Victoria, asking the British for formal recognition and for military assistance; the British demurred. The rebellion was eventually suppressed by Qing troops, who killed and posthumously decapitated Du. The brutal suppression led to many Hui people fleeing to neighboring countries bordering Yunnan. Surviving Huis escaped to Burma, Thailand and Laos, forming the basis of a minority Chinese Hui population in those nations. Hundreds of thousands of Hui people were massacred or died in these purges.|$|E
2500|$|Taft {{was elected}} to the first of his three terms as US Senator in 1938. He first {{defeated}} Ohio Supreme Court justice Arthur H. Day in the Republican primary, and then defeated the Democratic incumbent, Robert Bulkley, in the general election. Taft engaged Bulkley in several debates and was generally regarded as the winner. He struggled in the earlier debates but later came out on top through assistance from his wife, Martha, who would be regarded as the most valuable asset in his campaign. As a result, Taft gained the <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> Bulkley, who had earlier been regarded as the frontrunner in the race, and won the election by nearly 171,000 votes, or 53.6% of the total vote. During his first two years as a Senator, the Tafts rented a home in Washington, but in 1941 they purchased a brick Victorian home, built in the 1880s, in the city's Georgetown neighborhood. The home– despite lacking [...] "the grace and amenities of Sky Farm", their home in Ohio– remained their Washington residence until Taft's death in 1953.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reign of}} King Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar (r. 16731704) {{is a high}} point in {{the early history of}} the Kingdom of Mysore. The king, an able warrior known to have {{defeated}} even the Marathas on occasion, held the <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> the Nizam of Golconda and brought the Keladi territories under his domain by 1682. An able administrator, the king was inclined towards the Srivaishnava faith. His reign produced numerous prolific writers, not the least the king himself [...] he was an accomplished scholar in Kannada and a composer of music. A well-known treatise on music called Geeta Gopala, written in opera style and in the saptapadi metre, is credited to him. Though inspired by Jayadeva's Geeta Govinda (c.1200), it had an originality of its own. The work differs from the original in that the god Krishna and his Gopikas are the protagonists of the play instead of Krishna and his consort Radha. The writing consists of fourteen sections, with seven songs in each section. It is considered an asset to students of music and literature. The king's other works are commentaries on the Bhagavata and the later chapters of the epic Mahabharata, a collection of devotional poems written in thirty verses (Chikkadevaraya binappa, [...] "Kings Petition") and composed in praise of the god Cheluva Narayanaswamy of Melkote.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{organized}} Arab mounted forces {{under the}} Rashidun caliphate comprised a light cavalry armed with lance and sword. Its main {{role was to}} attack the enemy flanks and rear. These relatively lightly armored horsemen formed the most effective element of the Muslim armies during the later stages of the Islamic conquest of the Levant. The best use of this lightly armed fast moving cavalry was revealed at the Battle of Yarmouk (636 AD) in which Khalid ibn Walid, knowing the skills of his horsemen, used them to turn the tables at every critical instance of the battle with their ability to engage, disengage, then turn back and attack again from the flank or rear.

2500|$|Shortly {{after signing}} the Treaty of Córdoba, the Spanish {{government}} reneged. [...] Ferdinand VII had regained the <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> the liberals in Spain and increased his influence outside the country. [...] He even had credible {{plans for the}} reconquest of the old colony. [...] For these reasons, no European noble would accept the offer of a Mexican crown. [...] Inside Mexico itself, there was no noble family that the populace would accept as royalty. [...] In the meantime, the governing junta that Iturbide headed convened a constituent congress {{to set up the}} new government. [...] This new government did have indirect representation, based on the Cadiz model. [...] However, the Plan of Iguala and the Treaty of Córdoba were clear that the order of things would be kept as it had been before the Cadiz constitution. Thus, Iturbide and the junta therefore declared {{that they would not be}} bound by the Cadiz Constitution but kept the Congress that was convened. [...] This led to divisiveness which came to a head in February 1822. [...] In its inauguration Congress swore that it would never abide for all of the powers of the State to fall into the hands of a single person or entity. It however proceeded to assign sovereignty to itself rather than to the people, and proclaimed that it held all three powers of the State. It also considered lowering military pay and decreasing the size of the army. These moves threatened to reduce Iturbide's influence in current and future governments.|$|E
2500|$|First {{contender}} Blassie and Stasiak remained Morales' main {{rivals in}} the first two months of 1972, against whom he scored several draws and some wins. Graham, Valiant and Toru Tanaka served as enhancement talents. On February 18, 1972, Morales and Rivera defeated The Rugged Russians, continuing this parallel rivalry. March featured several different matchups, in which he emerged victorious against [...] "Baron" [...] Mikel Scicluna, Smasher Sloan and Rugged Russian #2, while consistently teaming with Rivera against Curtis Iaukea and Scicluna, both of whom he defeated individually throughout April. The following month feuds that ended in Morales earning several victories over Pampero Firpo, Tanaka, Iaukea and Albano. After disposing of Valiant, Graham, Scicluna and Graham again, the feud against Albano continued with wins in [...] regular and steel cage matches. During June 1972, Morales also bested other notable opponents, including Nikita Mulkovitch, Blue Demon and Ernie Ladd. To continue this run, he defeated George Steele in New York. Following wins three wins over Tanaka and more against Firpo, Morales teamed with Sammartino on July 18, 1972, to face the former and Mr. Fuji. The match featured the two most popular wrestlers of the era, but finished in a no contest with both of the involved in a confrontation after Mr. Fuji threw salt in both of their faces, ensuing a fight. A rematch took place, this time in a team with Monsoon, but finished in a draw. Morales defeated both Tanaka and Mr. Fuji by countout and won the following two tag team matches. This was followed by a series involving Steele, Fuji, Ernie Ladd, Chuck O'Connor and [...] "The Spoiler" [...] Don Jardine, none of whom were able to gain an <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> him. On September 30, 1972, Morales faced Bruno Sammartino {{in the first}}-ever match featuring two fan favorite, technical wrestlers. The crowd favored him, despite Sammartino's large fan base in the city of New York. After 75 minutes of wrestling featuring several near-falls, the contest ended in a draw, when the city's curfew entered in effect. Subsequently, both performers embraced, signifying the end of their rivalry and the reformation of the tag team. However, the lack of a resolution was not well received, the fans were noticeably angry, and some jumped into the dugouts to shake their fists at the wrestlers. The main event of the 1972 Showdown at Shea later became known as [...] "The Match of the Century" [...] and is still {{regarded as one of the}} best events in the history of professional wrestling. After scoring a win over The Spoiler, Morales joined Sammartino in a rematch against Tanaka and Mr. Fuji, this time emerging victorious in a three-fall contest.|$|E
