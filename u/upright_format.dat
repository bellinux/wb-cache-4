50|$|Baby {{grand pianos}} are the smallest, {{intended}} for homes, restaurants and similar applications where the grand style of piano is desired {{even at the}} expense of the longer scale and better sound that an <b>upright</b> <b>format</b> would permit in the available space.|$|E
5000|$|Wilder, one of {{the most}} {{influential}} members of the [...] "Decadence", commissioned Beardsley to illustrate the English version of his play, which resulted in The Climax, The Stomach Dance, and The Eyes of Herod, in which women are attributed with traditionally male vices of lust, desire to dominate, and materialism. The Climax was redrawn because The Studio owned the copyright for the original drawing. The femme fatale of the successor was less menacing. Stylistically, it was more advanced, and it was drawn with more conventional page proportions, as compared to the J’ai baisé ta bouche Iokanaan version made with an elongated <b>upright</b> <b>format.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Whereas {{fragment}} A3 is in oblong format, fragment B is in <b>upright</b> <b>format,</b> {{suggesting that}} the two fragments come from different manuscripts. Fragment B contains parts of two songs, {{both of which are}} in the Fayrfax manuscript. The second one contains the opening line from Davy's [...] "A blessid Jhesu" [...] (Fayrfax ms. No. 37). The recto and top of the verso were designated by Stevens as two different songs, although he left open the possibility that they could be from the same work. Fallows said they are two stanzas of the same carol and proposes that Fragment B contains the second and third stanzas. This leads Fallows to hypothesize that fragment B was not from a choirbook, but from a discantus partbook, because recto and verso of the fragment are a continuous discantus line, leading into another song.|$|E
2500|$|Bass banjos {{have been}} {{produced}} in both <b>upright</b> bass <b>formats</b> and with standard, horizontally carried banjo bodies. Contrabass banjos with either three or four strings have also been made; some of these had headstocks {{similar to those of}} bass violins. Tuning varies on these large instruments, with four-string models sometimes being tuned in 4ths like a bass violin—E1-A1-D2-G2, and sometimes in 5ths, like a four-string cello banjo, one octave lower—C1-G1-D2-A2. Other variants are also used.|$|R
2500|$|Exposure to both Western and Japanese style emoticons or kaomoji through blogs, instant messaging, and forums {{featuring}} {{a blend of}} Western and Japanese pop culture {{has given rise to}} many emoticons that have an <b>upright</b> viewing <b>format.</b> [...] The parentheses are often dropped, and these emoticons typically only use alphanumeric characters and the most commonly used English punctuation marks. Emoticons such as -O-, -3-, -w-, '_',_;, T_T, :>, and [...]V. are used to convey mixed emotions that are more difficult to convey with traditional emoticons. Characters are sometimes added to emoticons to convey an anime- or manga-styled sweat drop, for example ^_^', !>_ ...|$|R
5|$|Space Invaders {{was first}} {{released}} in a cocktail-table format {{with black and}} white graphics, while the Western release by Midway was in an <b>upright</b> cabinet <b>format.</b> The <b>upright</b> cabinet uses strips of orange and green cellophane over the screen to simulate color graphics. The graphics are reflected onto a painted backdrop of a moon against a starry background. Later Japanese releases used rainbow-colored cellophane, such as T.T. Space Invaders in 1978, followed by a version with a full-color display. The cabinet artwork features large humanoid monsters not present in the game. Nishikado attributes this to the artist basing the designs on the original title, Space Monsters, rather than referring to the in-game graphics.|$|R
40|$|The neonate {{and young}} child present unique {{problems}} in echocardiographic diagnosis {{because of the}} wide spectrum of possible abnormalities and the tendency toward multiple lesions, requiring clear visualization of all great veins and arteries as well as intracardiac structures. Performance and interpretation of echocardiograms {{in this age group}} require an extensive knowledge of the pathologic anatomy of congenital heart disease. Recognition of unusual lesions is facilitated by displaying the heart in an anatomically familiar (<b>upright)</b> <b>format</b> in order to draw from experience in angiography and pathology. The subxiphoid (subcostal) transducer position provides a flexible acoustic window for scanning the heart and great vessels in a multitude of planes, providing a general orientation for each cardiac segment. All other transducer positions are utilized to provide specific anatomic information. Although in this age group echocardiographic visualization of intracardiac anatomy is superior to other techniques, delineation of the great vessels remains its greatest limitation. Tortuous vessels may not lie in a single plane and, therefore, cannot always be displayed throughout its length by a "slice" technique such as echocardiography. In addition, limited focal range of most high frequency transducers is a continuing impediment to imaging structures in the posterior and superior mediastinum. Echocardiography provides a cost-effective means for identifying the neonate with life-threatening cardiovascular disease. It provides a complete and definitive anatomic diagnosis, in some cases eliminating the need for further procedures, while in others, improving the timing and performance of cardiac catheterization. Future studies should investigate the proper utilization of echocardiography as adjunct to or replacement of other techniques in the management of the young child...|$|E
40|$|The {{processing}} of upright, inverted and contrast-reversed faces was investigated using MEG. Peak and global field power {{analyses revealed that}} the M 100, M 170 and M 220 components were delayed for inverted and contrast-reversed compared to normal upright faces but no amplitude modulations were found. Source analyses using an event-related SAM beamformer technique revealed bilateral occipital sources for the M 100 and M 220 components. For the M 170, two distinct sources simultaneously active were found, a bilateral and posterior source (M 170 A) and a right lateralized ventral and more anterior source (M 170 B) around the fusiform gyrus. None of the sources varied in location or intensity between face types. However, although different from the M 100, {{the location of the}} M 170 A was not significantly {{different from that of the}} M 220, suggesting the latter could be a reactivation of the former. Confirming previous ERP results on the {{processing of}} inverted faces, the present study extends the findings to contrast-reversed face stimuli and suggests that deviations from the standard <b>upright</b> face <b>format</b> do not activate extra areas but simply result in the delayed activation of the sources generating the M 100, M 170 and M 220 components. The data confirm the sensitivity of the M 100 to face manipulations and further suggest that the M 170 is generated by two distinct sources, one of which situated in occipital extrastriate areas (M 170 A) could be reactivated around 220 ms to generate the M 220 component...|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} publication was a [...] "four-shape" [...] shape {{note book}} using {{the shapes and}} syllables [...] "faw, sol, law, and mi". Funk designed A Compilation of Genuine Church Music for use in singing schools. It contained 208 pages, including rudiments of music and tunes harmonized for three voices. Funk released a second edition in 1835, and a third in 1842. The 1847 fourth edition was the first publication by Joseph Funk and Sons at Singers Glen. The name was changed to Harmonia Sacra in 1851, using the original title as a subtitle. In 1851, Funk also changed from the four-shapes to the seven-shape shape note system. Rather than adopt the Aikin system, Funk devised his own. Further editions were released, including 1860, 1866, 1878, 1980 and 1993. In 1866, called the 12th edition, the three voice parts were expanded to four. After 1878 (17th edition), the rudiments of music were deleted. In 1980, the 24th edition, the format was changed, changing the old four stave oblong tunebook to an <b>upright</b> modern soprano-alto-tenor-bass <b>format.</b> The 25th edition (1993) restored the old oblong tunebook format, {{as well as the}} rudiments of music and 27 three-voice hymns from the first and second editions. A newly typeset 26th edition is available. An online edition of the 26th edition provides tunes in both four- and seven-shape settings.|$|R
