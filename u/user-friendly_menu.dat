40|$|Because {{physicians}} {{have been reluctant}} to accept computerized medical records systems, we sought to identify the barriers to acceptance and redesigned our ambulatory records system accordingly. We identified several problems physicians encounter in using our computerized medical record system (COSTAR), including physicians' hesitation to use a computer in front of their patients, physicians' poor keyboard skills, and the structural organization of the computerized medical record. We formed a users group to educate users and the group has helped identify solutions to these problems. We equipped the exam room terminals with a <b>user-friendly,</b> patient-specific <b>menu.</b> We created a new physician interface for COSTAR that was organized to function similarly to a patient's chart and features <b>user-friendly</b> <b>menus</b> that provide cues to the unsophisticated user. Physician use of exam room terminals tripled after the installation of the exam room menu. The new physician interface doubled physician use of COSTAR's scheduling features. Acceptance of the new interface as gauged by a user survey was excellent, with the majority stating it improved their patient care...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Heavy {{rainfall}} {{often leads}} to complete suspension of highway construction due to saturated and unworkable soil conditions. Therefore, quantifying the impact of rainfall on the productivity of highway con-struction is essential in preparing realistic schedules and cost estimates for the preconstruction stage and in analyzing weather-related claims for the postconstruction stage. This paper presents a decision support system for quantifying the impact of rainfall on productivity and duration of common highway construction operations, namely: earthmoving, construction of base courses, construction of drainage layers, and paving operations. The system incorporates a knowledgebase and a database. The knowledgebase includes if/then type rules, acquired from experts in highway construction operations, and the database contains hourly records of weather parameters from the closest weather station to the construction site. The system, named WEATHER, is a software system that provides <b>user-friendly</b> interface, including <b>menus,</b> dialog boxes, and graphical capabilities to facilitate data input and output...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Greece is a net {{importer}} {{of oil and}} gas and is among the most vulnerable countries of the European Union (EU) on energy supply disruptions. Furthermore, is considered a ""crossroad"" of existing and forthcoming infrastructure for importing energy to the EU. The {{purpose of this paper is}} the presentation of the web tool that implements the developed methodology for the quantification of socio-economic risks {{of oil and gas}} corridors. The tool is applied to the main present and future oil and gas corridors to Greece, and the related outcomes are discussed. Design/methodology/approach: A structured and coherent review on the future and present oil and natural gas (NG) corridors to Greece was elaborated, based on desk analysis and collection of the related data from national and international sources. Factor analysis was employed for the quantification of socio-economic risks of each energy corridor. Particular emphasis was laid on the tool's design, so as to be <b>user-friendly,</b> combining intuitive <b>menus</b> and navigation throughout the steps of the system. Findings: The calculation of socio-economic risks of the main oil and gas corridors to Greece provides operative and measurable concepts for supporting energy-modelling processes. Indeed, this paper provides useful insights on the factors affecting the smooth energy supply and the reliability of oil and gas supply options to the Greek energy system. Moreover, the presented web tool can be used as a reference point for the researcher working on energy supply risks quantification. Originality/value: The introduction of the energy corridors perspective in the valuation of supply security is of significant importance, taking into account the constantly increasing energy dependence of EU countries. To the best of the authors' knowledge, a structured and coherent review of the future and present oil and NG corridors to Greece is not present in the international literature. In addition to this, the development of the web tool is a clear contribution towards the quantification of the economic and socio-political risk analysis and a step forward of the existing studies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R
40|$|An {{object-oriented}} {{model is}} presented for optimized scheduling of repetitive construction projects such as: high-rise buildings, housing projects, highways, pipeline networks, bridges and tunnels. The model provides {{a number of}} practical features, and incorporates newly developed algorithms for scheduling of repetitive construction projects including: (1) a resource-driven scheduling algorithm for repetitive activities; (2) an interruption algorithm; and (3) an optimization procedure. The scheduling algorithm identifies the scheduled start and finish times {{as well as the}} assigned crew for each unit of a repetitive activity. The algorithm provides a schedule that complies with precedence relationships, crew availability and crew work continuity constraints, and considers the impact of a number of practical factors commonly encountered during scheduling. The interruption algorithm generates feasible interruption vectors for each repetitive activity in the project and provides added advantage over available formulations that consider arbitrary user-specified interruption vectors. The optimization procedure is based on a dynamic programming formulation. Unlike available dynamic programming formulations, the present formulation is capable of incorporating cost in the optimization process, thus offering valuable support to project team members in minimizing the overall cost of the project. For each repetitive activity in the project, the present model assists the planner in selecting the optimum crew formation and interruption vector from a set of possible alternatives. As such, the model can be used to evaluate the impact of different project acceleration strategies (i. e. multiple crews, increased crew size, overtime policies, or additional shifts) on the overall cost. The present model is implemented as a prototype software system. The system is developed as a 32 -bit windows application that supports <b>user-friendly</b> interface including <b>menus,</b> dialog boxes, and windows. A number of application examples are analyzed to illustrate the use of the model and demonstrate its capabilities. The model {{can be used as a}} decision support system for generating optimized schedules for repetitive construction projects. This should contribute to cost-effective delivery of constructed projects...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 17 - 20, 1994 / Town & Country Hotel and Conference Center, San Diego, CaliforniaAs modern weapons {{grow more}} {{sophisticated}} and capable of operating autonomously, the challenge of testing these weapons has also grown more complex. Seekers may be multispectral and {{must be able to}} overcome threat countermeasures. To effectively analyze the performance of these weapons, time-correlated test data must be efficiently, simultaneously acquired from both the weapons' internal busses and from the threat countermeasures' internal communication busses, often in a "live fire" environment. The test data must be transmitted to a central processing station where test personnel may immediately analyze the performance of the weapon with the assistance of scientific visualization techniques. In addition, the data must be captured on permanent media for future playback and more detailed analysis. One solution is to link the test article, threat countermeasures and other test support resources through an Integrated Telemetry System (ITS). Instrumentation to acquire high-speed test data is installed in data collection vans that are remotely located {{in the vicinity of the}} article under test or in the vicinity of the threat countermeasures systems or test support resources. The remote vans will be interconnected and linked to a control van which provides a centralized test control and monitoring point. Remote Data Formatter (RDF) instrumentation units, located in the remote vans, can acquire data from and control seekers, sensors, emission sources or other equipment located in or near the remote vans. The RDF units can also format the data for transmission to the control van via either fiber optic or microwave radio links. The data transmitted from multiple remote vans is received by Real-time Data Processing System (RTPS) units located in the control van for merging, processing and recording. Some of the processed data can be transferred to a Host Processing System (HPS) where it can be displayed on color graphic workstations. The control van's HPS workstations provide <b>user-friendly</b> displays and <b>menus</b> for test setup and control. Both the remote and control vans are equipped with secure digital communication systems capable of supporting compressed digital video, audio, high-speed instrumentation data and an Ethernet computer network...|$|R
