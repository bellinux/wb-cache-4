Convergent evolution creates analogous structures that have similar form or function {{but were not}} present in the last common ancestor of those groups.

Functionally similar features that have arisen through convergent evolution are analogous, whereas homologous structures or traits have a common origin but can have dissimilar functions.

To our friend Drowne there came a brief season of excitement, kindled by love. It rendered him a genius for that one occasion, but, quenched in disappointment, left him again the mechanical carver in wood, without the power even of appreciating the work that his own hands had wrought. Yet who can doubt that the very highest state to which a human spirit can attain, in its loftiest aspirations, is its truest and most natural state, and that Drowne was more consistent with himself when he wrought the admirable figure of the mysterious lady, than when he perpetrated a whole progeny of blockheads? ...|$|E

The crystal structures of the samples were studied via X-ray diffractometry and scanning electron microscopy. Hydrogenation/dehydrogenation characteristics were investigated using a Sievert apparatus.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the isolation and identification of biosurfactant producing bacteria from Iranian oil wells. The biosurfactant production of bacteria isolates was evaluated and confirmed using hemolysis and emulsification tests. The biodegradation of crude oil was studied using GC and HPLC analysis. A total of 45 strains have been isolated. These strains showed less than a 40 mN m- 1 reduction in surface tension. The effects of different pH (4. 2 - 9. 2), salinity concentrations (1 %- 15 %), and temperatures (25 - 50) in biosurfactant production of isolated strains were evaluated. One of the strains (Bacillus sp. NO. 4) showed a high salt tolerance and a successful production of biosurfactant in a vast pH range. Its maximum biomass production (about 3. 1 g L- 1 dry weight) was achieved after 60 hours of growth. The surface tension of the culture broth dropped rapidly after inoculation and reached its lowest value (36 mN m- 1) during the exponential phase after about 36 - 48 hours of growth. The study of the GC graphs showed that higher aliphatic reduction occurred in fractions with C 14 to C 24 hydrocarbons.
