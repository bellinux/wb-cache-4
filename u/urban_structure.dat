It appears {{for the first time}} in historical sources in the Ebla tablets around 2,300 BC, and gained particular importance during the Neo-Assyrian period. During the Sassanian period and the Abbasid Caliphate, Erbil was an important centre for Christianity. After the Mongols captured the citadel in 1258, the importance of Erbil declined. During the 20th century, the <b>urban</b> <b>structure</b> was significantly modified, as a result of which a number of houses and public buildings were destroyed. In 2007, the High Commission for Erbil Citadel Revitalization (HCECR) was established to oversee the restoration of the citadel. In the same year, all inhabitants, except one family, were evicted from the citadel as part of a large restoration project. Since then, archaeological research and restoration works have been carried out at and around the tell by various international teams and in cooperation with local specialists.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, several {{advanced}} {{methods for}} detecting and classifying <b>urban</b> <b>structures</b> in high-resolution SAR imagery are presented. The detection of man-made structures resp. {{the suppression of}} clutter, for example natural surfaces, {{can be accomplished by}} a coherent time-frequency analysis. These techniques can detect targets in the scene that behave like pointscatterers (such as edges, poles, etc.) by their high degree of correlation across sub-apertures of the scene. If polarimetric data are available, this approach can be extended by taking into account the frequently anisotropic polarimetric backscattering of man-made targets. As a third approach, a simple but powerful operator for detecting <b>urban</b> <b>structures</b> by analysing texture inhomogeneity in SAR images is developed. A second objective of this paper is the segmentation and classification of the detected <b>urban</b> <b>structures.</b> Based on the detected man-made structures, the characteristic structure size is investigated, using several approaches, to distinguishing between residential areas, industrial areas and dense city centres. The methods are evaluated using several real airborne SAR datasets. I...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis investigates how <b>urban</b> <b>structures</b> {{influence}} travel behaviour in {{the city}} region of Oslo and Akershus. Global climate change {{is one of the}} greatest challenges of our time. In search for ways to mitigate CO 2 emissions, policymakers have turned their eyes to the transport sector. It is often conceived that polycentric city regions with compact, transit-oriented cities and neighbourhoods reduce distances travelled, discourage car use and promote the use of alternative transport modes. Multivariate quantitative models are applied in this thesis to address specifically three shortcomings in the assumed causality between <b>urban</b> <b>structures</b> and travel behaviour. First, car ownership usually overshadows the effect of all other factors on travel behaviour. The findings in this thesis indicate, however, that car ownership function as a mediator between <b>urban</b> <b>structures</b> and travel behaviour. Second, the influence of trip destination locations on travel behaviour is understudied, particularly in a Nordic context. In this thesis, the <b>urban</b> <b>structures</b> at trip destination locations, especially workplace density, turn out to have a major impact on transport mode choice. Third, few Nordic studies, and none of them Norwegian, have taken into account the street design in the local neighbourhoods. Moreover, diversity measures, such as the degree of mixed building or land use, have not been popular in Nordic studies. The findings in this thesis indicate that future studies should take diversity and design elements into consideration...|$|R
