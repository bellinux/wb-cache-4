5|$|For a {{suspected}} first leg DVT in a moderate-probability scenario, a high-sensitivity D-dimer is suggested as a recommended option over <b>ultrasound</b> imaging, with both whole-leg and compression <b>ultrasound</b> possible.

5|$|Given that {{ascending}} cholangitis usually {{occurs in}} the setting of bile duct obstruction, various forms of medical imaging may be employed to identify the site and nature of this obstruction. The first investigation is usually <b>ultrasound,</b> as this is the most easily available. <b>Ultrasound</b> may show dilation of the bile duct and identifies 38% of bile duct stones; it is relatively poor at identifying stones farther down the bile duct. <b>Ultrasound</b> can help distinguish between cholangitis and cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder), which has similar symptoms to cholangitis but appears differently on <b>ultrasound.</b> A better test is magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), which uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); this has a comparable sensitivity to ERCP. Smaller stones, however, can still be missed on MRCP depending {{on the quality of the}} hospital's facilities.|$|E
5|$|Imaging {{tests of}} the veins {{are used in the}} {{diagnosis}} of DVT, most commonly either proximal compression <b>ultrasound</b> or whole-leg <b>ultrasound.</b> Each technique has drawbacks: a single proximal scan may miss a distal DVT, while whole-leg scanning can lead to distal DVT overtreatment. Doppler <b>ultrasound,</b> CT scan venography, MRI venography, or MRI of the thrombus are also possibilities.|$|E

5|$|<b>Ultrasound</b> is {{commonly}} used {{in the evaluation of}} people who have sustained physical trauma, for example with the FAST protocol. <b>Ultrasound</b> may be more sensitive than chest X-rays in the identification of pneumothorax after blunt trauma to the chest. <b>Ultrasound</b> may also provide a rapid diagnosis in other emergency situations, and allow the quantification {{of the size of the}} pneumothorax.

5|$|<b>Ultrasound</b> of {{the liver}} and biliary tree is often used as the initial imaging {{modality}} in patients with suspected obstructive jaundice. <b>Ultrasound</b> can identify obstruction and ductal dilatation and, in some cases, may be sufficient to diagnose cholangiocarcinoma.

5|$|Instead of anticoagulation, a {{follow-up}} imaging test (typically <b>ultrasound)</b> about one-week post-diagnosis {{is an option}} for those with an acute isolated distal DVT without a high risk for extension; if the clot does not grow, the ACCP does not recommend anticoagulation. This technique can benefit those at a high risk for bleeding. Patients may choose anticoagulation over serial imaging, however, to avoid the inconvenience of another scan if concerns {{about the risk of}} bleeding are insignificant. When applied to symptomatic patients with a negative initial <b>ultrasound</b> result, serial testing is inefficient and not cost effective.|$|E

5|$|The <b>ultrasound</b> {{equipment}} must be of sufficiently {{high quality}} {{in order to}} give a correct image processing result, which can then provide invaluable information, mainly at the superficial level. It must be able to provide both color and Doppler imaging; technologies that developed alongside the development of <b>ultrasound.</b> The use of Doppler measurements which trace the echoes of the generated soundwaves received by the probe, enable the direction and the velocity of the blood flow, to be depicted. The overlay of color onto the Doppler information lets these images be seen more clearly.|$|E

5|$|Transvaginal <b>ultrasound</b> {{to examine}} the endometrial {{thickness}} in women with postmenopausal bleeding is increasingly being used {{to aid in the}} diagnosis of endometrial cancer in the United States. In the United Kingdom, both an endometrial biopsy and a transvaginal <b>ultrasound</b> used in conjunction are the standard of care for diagnosing endometrial cancer. The homogeneity of the tissue visible on transvaginal <b>ultrasound</b> can help to indicate whether the thickness is cancerous. <b>Ultrasound</b> findings alone are not conclusive in cases of endometrial cancer, so another screening method (for example endometrial biopsy) must be used in conjunction. Other imaging studies are of limited use. CT scans are used for preoperative imaging of tumors that appear advanced on physical exam or have a high-risk subtype (at high risk of metastasis).

40|$|This paper {{collects}} {{the experimental}} results {{obtained in the}} Thermal Fluid Dynamics Lab at the Department of Energy and Engineering Systems at the University of Pisa, concerning the influence of <b>ultrasounds</b> in single phase free convection and in pool saturated boiling, at atmospheric pressure. The authors have just reported in previous papers their results about the enhancement induced {{by the presence of}} ultrasonic waves in subcooled boiling conditions. The <b>ultrasounds</b> are applied at the set frequency of 40 kHz, with a transducer output changing from 300 to 500 W, on a circular horizontal cylinder heated by Joule effect, immersed in distilled water. The tests in single phase free convection, without ultrasonic waves, are validated by means of the classical correlations reported in literature. Moreover, the authors managed to correlate the data also in presence of <b>ultrasounds.</b> The enhancement of the heat transfer coefficient is lower than the one obtained in subcooled boiling and with regards to the saturated pool boiling conditions, as far as for subcooling degrees very close to the saturation, the <b>ultrasounds</b> cause a decrease of the heat transfer. At the same time, the <b>ultrasounds</b> induce the critical heat flux (CHF) at higher heat flux compared with the case without <b>ultrasounds.</b> Also in saturated pool boiling, without ultrasonic waves, the experimental value of the CHF is compared with the one obtained by equations reported in the literature. This paper, joined to the others published by the authors, makes clear systematically the effects of <b>ultrasounds</b> on the heat transfer and shows as they could be very useful in the last generation electronic components cooling...|$|R
