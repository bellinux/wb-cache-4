5|$|The most {{distinctive}} feature of Saurolophus is its cranial crest, which {{is present in}} young individuals, but is smaller. It is long and spike-like and projects <b>upward</b> <b>and</b> backward at about a 45° angle, starting from over the eyes. This crest {{is often described as}} solid, but appears to be solid only at the point, with internal chambers that may have had a respiratory and/or heat-regulation function.|$|E

5|$|A {{wide variety}} of weather can be found along an {{occluded}} front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage {{is associated with a}} drying of the air mass. Within the occlusion of the front, a circulation of air brings warm air <b>upward</b> <b>and</b> sends drafts of cold air downward, or vice versa depending on the occlusion the front is experiencing. Precipitations and clouds are associated with the trowal, the projection on the Earth's surface of the tongue of warm air aloft formed during the occlusion process of the depression.|$|E

5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} may {{be divided}} into two distinct size classes, small and large, with the large size class being about one and a half times larger than the small class, and the small class being twice as common as the large class. Both size classes lived alongside each other, and while researchers had previously suggested that they represent different species, Christopher Bennett showed that the differences between them are consistent with the concept that they represent females and males, and that Pteranodon species were sexually dimorphic. Skulls from the larger size class preserve large, <b>upward</b> <b>and</b> backward pointing crests, while the crests of the smaller size class are small and triangular. Some larger skulls also show evidence of a second crest that extended long and low, toward the tip of the beak, which is not seen in smaller specimens.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that the energy {{necessary}} to heat the corona is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere, and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating. The first is wave heating, in which sound, gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone. These waves travel <b>upward</b> <b>and</b> dissipate in the corona, depositing their energy in the ambient matter {{in the form of}} heat. The other is magnetic heating, in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through magnetic reconnection in the form of large solar flares and myriad similar but smaller events—nanoflares.|$|E

The victorious ant will remain raised <b>upward</b> <b>and</b> reach {{down to the}} worker and open its mandibles wider, grasping on the opponent's mandibles, and then tug and shake its head slightly for a few moments. However, the fight may continue if neither worker backs down, and will commence a side to side posture.

Eventually, they will break contact and groom once appeasement has been reached and continue to search for another ant.|$|E
5|$|The {{blurring}} or {{diffusion of}} the Republic's more rigid hierarchies led to increased social mobility under the Empire, both <b>upward</b> <b>and</b> downward, {{to an extent}} that exceeded that of all other well-documented ancient societies. Women, freedmen, and slaves had opportunities to profit and exercise influence in ways previously less available to them. Social life in the Empire, particularly for those whose personal resources were limited, was further fostered by a proliferation of voluntary associations and confraternities (collegia and sodalitates) formed for various purposes: professional and trade guilds, veterans' groups, religious sodalities, drinking and dining clubs, performing arts troupes, and burial societies.|$|E
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} characteristic of Pteranodon is its cranial crest. These crests consisted of skull bones (frontals) projecting <b>upward</b> <b>and</b> backward from the skull. The {{size and shape}} of these crests varied due to a number of factors, including age, sex, and species. Male Pteranodon sternbergi, the older species of the two described to date (and sometimes placed in the distinct genus Geosternbergia), had a more vertical crest with a broad forward projection, while their descendants, Pteranodon longiceps, evolved a narrower, more backward-projecting crest. Females of both species were smaller and bore small, rounded crests. The crests were probably mainly display structures, though they may have had other functions as well.|$|E

5|$|In Wonder Boy in Monster Land, players control Wonder Boy as he {{destroys the}} monsters in Monster Land and defeats the MEKA dragon. When the player begins the game, Wonder Boy starts {{out in the}} City of Wonder Land without any items or gold, but {{to give him a}} chance, at the {{beginning}} of the game, the city's mayor gives him a sword and a revival potion and sets him off on his own. The game is divided into twelve levels, and each of them has its own unique features, items, monsters, and secrets. These levels include towns, valleys, deserts, islands, and castles. Players use the D-pad to move Wonder Boy on the main screen, to enter doors by pressing <b>upward,</b> <b>and</b> to use Magic Weapons by pressing downward. The D-pad is also used to select between various items when in a shop. Players also have two buttons: one which makes Wonder Boy attack with his sword and buy items in the shop; and one which makes Wonder Boy jump and skip through storylines.|$|E
5|$|Mature {{specimens}} of Battarrea phalloides roughly resemble the typical agaric mushroom stature of stem and cap. However, {{rather than a}} cap with gills, this species has a spore sac atop the stem. When young, the fruit body is roughly spherical and completely encased in an outer wall (exoperidium) that later splits in a circumscissile fashion (along a circular or equatorial line), the lower wall forming a volva and the upper part forming scales that cover the inner wall. The upper part rolls <b>upward</b> <b>and</b> backward and eventually falls away in one piece, exposing a spore sac lined with a narrow ring of capillitium and spores. The spores are sticky. As these are carried away by the wind, the drying action of the latter cause {{the edges of the}} peridium to shrivel and roll up more, exposing more spores. This is continued until the upper half of the peridium has shriveled and blown away and there remains only a few spores, which may be washed away by rain.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before midnight, Taylor was {{led into}} the {{execution}} chamber and strapped to a chair 17 {{feet away from the}} shooters with a hood covering his head. Multiple bright lights covered Taylor. Sandbags were arranged behind him to prevent any ricochets. The captain walked down the aisle, tapping each shooter on the shoulder to check to see if they were ready. At 12:03 a.m. Mountain Standard Time on January 26, 1996, every shooter fired at the count of five and the white cloth target on Taylor's chest flew off. His chest moved <b>upward</b> <b>and</b> his left hand tightened into a fist. His grip gradually loosened and his head fell back. A doctor checked Taylor's neck for a pulse and cut two holes in his hood to check for a pupillary light reflex. Taylor was declared dead at 12:07 a.m. and became the 49th person to be executed in the state of Utah since 1852.|$|E

40|$|This {{doctoral}} study {{focuses on}} <b>upward</b> influence tactics <b>and</b> the social exchange process {{which takes place}} between leaders and their followers. The research posits Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) dimensions as a theoretical mechanism for understanding how upward influence tactics work. More specifically, it analyses the roles of LMX dimensions in mediating the relationship between followers’ <b>upward</b> influence tactics <b>and</b> job performance ratings. Furthermore, it seeks to understand the role of gender similarity in moderating the relationship between <b>upward</b> influence tactics <b>and</b> LMX dimensions. It goes on to query upward influence tactics’ direct and non-linear relationships with job performance ratings, the differences between leaders’ and followers’ reporting {{of the use of}} follower <b>upward</b> influence tactics <b>and</b> test their relationships with job performance ratings, and the use of these tactics in the Saudi context. The empirical research for the present study took place in public, private, and non-profit organizations in Saudi Arabia. This is a country which has not been the focus of research on influence tactics to date in the literature. Based on a sample of 389 leader-follower pairs, the results show a number of significant relationships. Results revealed that rationality and self-presentation tactics have positive relationships with job performance ratings while exchange of benefits <b>and</b> <b>upward</b> appeal tactics have negative relationships with job performance ratings. Moreover, LMX-loyalty mediates the relationship between upward influence tactics of rationality, ingratiation, <b>upward</b> appeal, coalition, <b>and</b> self-presentation with job performance ratings. LMX-affect mediates the relationship between upward influence tactics of <b>upward</b> appeal <b>and</b> coalition with job performance ratings. Gender similarity moderates the relationship between rationality ingratiation, <b>upward</b> appeal, coalition, <b>and</b> self-presentation tactics and LMX-loyalty. Specifically, the relationship between these tactics and job performance ratings are mediated by LMX-loyalty in case of the leader and the follower having the same gender. Additionally, non-linear relationships have been found between the use of coalition <b>and</b> <b>upward</b> appeal tactics <b>and</b> job performance ratings within Saudi culture. These latter findings suggesting non-linear effects for some upward influence tactics propose new avenues for conducting {{research in the area of}} influence tactics within differing cultural contexts. Finally, while rational persuasion and ingratiation were the most-used tactics, self-presentation was moderately used in Saudi culture. Assertiveness, <b>upward</b> appeal, coalition, <b>and</b> exchange of benefits were used far less by comparison in Saudi Arabian culture...|$|R

5|$|The toothcomb of most lemuriforms {{includes}} six finely spaced teeth, four incisors and two canine {{teeth that}} are procumbent (tilt forward) {{in the front}} of the mouth. The procumbent lower canine teeth are the same shape as the incisors located between them, but they are more robust and curve <b>upward</b> <b>and</b> inward, more so than the incisors. In the permanent dentition, the canines erupt after the incisors. The crowns of the incisors are also angled in the direction of the forward tilt, and the crowns of both the incisors and canines are elongated and compressed side-to-side. The apical ridge, following along the front edges of the toothcomb teeth, is V-shaped in most lemuriforms, tapering off from the midline. As a result of this dental reconfiguration, the upper and lower incisors do not contact one another, and often the upper incisors are reduced or lost completely.|$|E

It will be shown, however, that the standard derivational theory that posits the derivational component to treat <b>upward</b> movement <b>and</b> the LF representation/component to accommodate reconstruction cannot be modified in any straightforward manner. Alternatively, I will propose a representational theory of grammar in which there is no distinction between derivational component and LF representation/component, hence no distinction between <b>upward</b> movement <b>and</b> reconstruction either. It will be demonstrated that the proposed representational theory exceeds any conceivable derivational theory in explanatory adequacy...|$|R
