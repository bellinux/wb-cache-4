The EPB soon took responsibility for the attack and noted {{that it was a}} warning in response to the Invasion of Grenada. The organization referred to this as [...] "Operación La Guillotina" [...] and despite claiming success publicly, its strategists were frustrated that {{due to a lack of}} vantage points the commandoes had been unable to target the FBI offices directly, the <b>use</b> of <b>registered</b> <b>cars</b> and a deviation from the planned escape route. The FBI was able to track down the precedence of the cars and were able to find a traffic ticket attributed to a [...] "Pedro Almodova Rivera" [...] and using the information provided in this license, discovered the hideout of Filiberto Ojeda Ríos who had been on their wanted list for 13 years and who they claimed was a Cuban intelligence officer besides a leader in the EPB and coordinator of several pro-independence factions.

This changed in late 2011 when each county (prior to 2010) had their next available sequence number increased dramatically for no particular reason other than being easily identified as an [...] "import". For example, 10-D-120006 would be the 6th import in Dublin of a car from 2010, as Dublin's re-registration band starts at 120000. Meath's starts at 15000.|$|R
