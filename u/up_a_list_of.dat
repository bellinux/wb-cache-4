5|$|The Condemnations at {{the medieval}} University of Paris were enacted to {{restrict}} certain teachings as being heretical. These included {{a number of}} medieval theological teachings, but most importantly the physical treatises of Aristotle. The investigations of these teachings were conducted by the Bishops of Paris.

5|$|Tolman and Conant, {{in their}} role as the project's {{scientific}} advisers, drew <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> candidate scientists and had them rated by scientists already working on the project.

At the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Stanislaw Ulam gave one of his students, Joan Hinton, an exam early, so she could leave to do war work. A few weeks later, Ulam received a letter from Hans Bethe, inviting him to join the project. Conant personally persuaded Kistiakowsky to join the project.|$|E

5|$|According to cricket {{historian}} Bernard Whimpress, {{the early}} signs of a conspiracy against Marsh were raised by a journalist from The Age of Melbourne {{by the name of}} Old Boy. The journalist set a possible agenda by raising a question about Marsh to Crockett on the day before the bowler was called, possibly predisposing the umpire to take action. If Old Boy could be relied on, then observers suspected that Marsh's faster and slower ball were dubious. The reporter did not specify which ball he questioned, except to say that one ball per over was doubtful. The events in Australia occurred against a backdrop of a throwing frenzy in England. A fortnight earlier, the captains of the English county teams had drawn <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> prohibited bowlers. In Australia, Jim Phillips had set the tone by no-balling Australian Test bowler Ernie Jones. The events in England were seen as a catalyst for a clean-up campaign against dubious bowling actions. Historians regarded Marsh as a prime target due to his Indigenous heritage and his supple wrist action.|$|E
5|$|As {{the project}} neared its conclusion, American {{planners}} began {{to consider the}} use of the bomb. Groves formed a committee that met in April and May 1945 to draw <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> targets. One of the primary criteria was that the target cities must not have been damaged by conventional bombing. This would allow for an accurate assessment of the damage done by the atomic bomb. The targeting committee's list included 18 Japanese cities. At {{the top of the list}} were Kyoto, Hiroshima, Yokohama, Kokura, and Niigata. Ultimately, Kyoto was removed from the list at the insistence of Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, who had visited the city on his honeymoon and knew of its cultural and historical significance.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Hergé's English {{language}} publishers, Methuen, were planning on translating and publishing The Black Island for the British market. Methuen believed that many British readers {{would find the}} depiction of Britain in the comic inaccurate and out-of-date, and drew <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> 131 errors that they asked Hergé to rectify before they would publish it in English. They were also aware that the work would appear particularly dated when compared {{with some of the}} most recently published Adventures like Destination Moon and The Calculus Affair, which made use of advanced technologies in their plot. At the time, Hergé was busy producing the twenty-second Tintin story, Flight 714 to Sydney, and so did not have the time to undertake research into contemporary British society and culture. Instead, he sent his assistant Bob De Moor to Britain in October 1961, where he visited such sites as Batemans and the White Cliffs of Dover, making many observations as to new developments in clothing and architecture. While in England, De Moor sought out various contemporary uniforms to use as a basis for more accurate illustrations. A police constabulary lent him a police uniform, although when he asked British Rail if he could borrow one of their uniforms, their staff were suspicious and refused.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} now escalated {{into an open}} breach as Sverre began building <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> privileges that were contrary to the church law made by St. Olaf, the traditional founder of the Norwegian Church. Eirik on his side preached against the king and his men, and sent letters of complaint to the Pope, but {{in the short term}} his offensive weapons were few. In 1190 Sverre attempted to force the archbishop into submission, claiming that Eirik had broken the law by having 90 armed men in his service. According to law, the archbishop's guard was limited to 30 men. Rather than submit to the king's will, Eirik fled to Lund where the Danish archbishop had his seat. From there he sent a delegation to Rome asking the pope for advice.|$|E
25|$|In June, disillusioned {{members of}} the Latvian Riflemen began {{appearing}} in anti-Bolshevik circles in Petrograd and were eventually directed to Captain Cromie, a British naval attaché, and Mr. Constantine, a Turkish merchant who was actually Reilly. As Latvians were deemed the Praetorian Guard of the Bolsheviks and entrusted with {{the security of the}} Kremlin, Reilly believed their participation in the pending coup to be vital and arranged their meeting with Lockhart at the British mission in Moscow. At this stage, Reilly planned a coup against the Bolshevik government and drew <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> Soviet military leaders ready to assume responsibilities on the fall of the Bolshevik government. While the coup was being prepared, an Allied force landed on 4 August 1918, at Arkhangelsk, Russia, beginning a famous military expedition dubbed Operation Archangel. Its objective was to prevent the German Empire from obtaining Allied military supplies stored in the region. In retaliation for this incursion, the Bolsheviks raided the British diplomatic mission on 5 August, disrupting a meeting Reilly had arranged between the anti-Bolshevik Latvians, UDMF officials, and Lockhart.|$|E
25|$|BLAT {{is used to}} find {{regions in}} a target genomic {{database}} which are similar to a query sequence under examination. The general algorithmic process followed by BLAT is similar to BLAST's in that it first searches for short segments in the database and query sequences which have {{a certain number of}} matching elements. These alignment seeds are then extended in both directions of the sequences in order to form high-scoring pairs. However, BLAT uses a different indexing approach from BLAST, which allows it to rapidly scan very large genomic and protein databases for similarities to a query sequence. It does this by keeping an indexed list (hash table) of the target database in memory, which significantly reduces the time required for the comparison of the query sequences with the target database. This index is built by taking the coordinates of all the non-overlapping k-mers (words with k letters) in the target database, except for highly repeated k-mers. BLAT then builds a list of all overlapping k-mers from the query sequence and searches for these in the target database, building <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> hits where there are matches between the sequences (Figure 1 illustrates this process).|$|E
