40|$|Eleven {{types of}} forest {{management}} were investigated (coniferous and deciduous age-class forest at pole-, young- and old timber stage, continuous cover forest management, selectively cut forest management, farmers’ forest, coppice, coppicewith- standards and <b>unmanaged</b> <b>forest)</b> {{with respect to}} ground-based measurements (diameter at breast height, stand density, tree height, wood volume, tree species composition, coarse woody debris, regeneration, deer browsing) and remotely sensed variables by LiDAR (e. g. canopy height, canopy surface area, canopy depth). Wood volume ranged between 320 m 3 ha- 1 in continuous cover forest and 730 m 3 ha- 1 in farmers’ forest. Basal area was between 25 m 2 ha- 1 in deciduous age-class forest and 49 m 2 ha- 1 in farmers’ forest. Coarse woody debris ranged between 11 m 3 ha- 1 in selectively cut forest and 39 m 3 ha- 1 in <b>unmanaged</b> <b>forest.</b> Number of tree species was lowest in the selectively cut forest (1 to 2 tree species per ha) and highest in coppice forest (up to 8 tree species per ha). Density of regeneration was independent of management, but damage due to deer browsing was highest in <b>unmanaged</b> <b>forest</b> reserves and in selectively cut forest, leading to a decline of admixed species. We found that a classification according to management types as based on management plans is not appropriate for scientific studies of relations between forest structure, biodiversity, and management at plot scale. In reality, some management types, such as continuous cover forest, were not sufficiently distinct. The most consistent separation was between longrotation, short-rotation and uneven-aged forests. The remotely sensed variables distinguished forest structures more clearly than ground-based measurements. Nevertheless, structural variables might be rather similar between unrelated management systems and rather dissimilar even within the same management type at plot scales between 500 m 2 and 0, 64 ha.

30|$|The wood quality from 50 - to 70 -year-old Tectona grandis {{trees from}} an <b>unmanaged</b> <b>forest</b> in East Timor was assessed. The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} teak in mature stands that had undergone uncontrolled disturbances, e.g., fire and local community usage. Heartwood represented 91 % of the tree radius at a height of 1.7 m, and sapwood contained on average nine rings. The mean ring width showed within-tree and between-tree variability. The chemical compositions of heartwood and sapwood were similar. Within-tree chemical variation occurred {{only in terms of}} extractives, which increased from the pith (8.3 %) to the heartwood-sapwood transition (12.7 %) and decreased in the sapwood (9.2 %). Overall, the wood properties of teak from a <b>unmanaged</b> <b>forest</b> in East Timor were comparable to those reported for plantation teaks of other origin: 607 kg/m 3 basic density, 3.5 % and 5.2 % radial and tangential shrinkage, 141 N/mm 2 modulus of rupture, 10684 N/mm 2 modulus of elasticity, and 50 N/mm 2 maximum crushing strength in compression parallel to the grain. Disturbances on individual tree growth arising from the unmanaged status of the stand were evidenced by higher within-tree variability of ring width.

40|$|Recent {{debate about}} how timber prices affect {{deforestation}} has focused mainly on how log export bans (imposed {{in many developing}} countries to protect domestic timber processing) affect deforestation. One side argues that the lower domestic timber prices that result from banning log exports increase deforestation by making forestry less profitable than competing land uses, such as agriculture. The other argues that lower timber prices reduce profits from logging, so they slow down deforestation caused by logging. The author argues that the conflicting views result from simplistic analysis that ignores differences between types of forest. The two positions are reconciled by distinguishing between <b>unmanaged</b> <b>forests</b> (for example, biologically mature, previously unlogged primary forests) and managed forests (such as forest plantations cultivated for periodic harvest). This distinction allows the derivation of unambiguous comparative static results and is useful because many nontimber benefits from forests (such as biodiversity conservation) are associated mainly with <b>unmanaged</b> <b>forests.</b> The distinction between managed and <b>unmanaged</b> <b>forests</b> leads to both unconventional and conventional results. All things being equal, a lower timber price results in larger areas of <b>unmanaged</b> <b>forests</b> and smaller areas of managed forests. That is, measures that reduce the producer price for timber (for example, import restrictions in timber-consuming countries and export restrictions in timber-producing countries) are suitable as a second-best policy to reduce the pressure on unmanaged forest frontiers. Most logging in tropical forests occurs in <b>unmanaged</b> <b>forests,</b> so the claim that trade restrictions (such as log export bans) increase deforestation is inconsistent with profit-maximizing land use. A fee on land used for logging is preferable to a tax on timber output,which is far more common but encourages logging waste. Technological interventions that increase the intensity of forestry or alternative land uses are an ambiguous instrument for the conservation of <b>unmanaged</b> <b>forests.</b> If demand elasticity for outputs is high, an intervention that increases the intensity of agriculture, logging, or other land uses increases incentive for conversion of <b>unmanaged</b> <b>forests.</b> The building of roads is particularly harmful to the conservation of <b>unmanaged</b> <b>forests,</b> as it increases incentives for logging and subsequent alternative land uses. Proper pricing of forest lands would increase land prices and lead to market-driven intensification accompanied by forest protection. Such pricing policies would be preferable to a technological intervention that increases land use intensity with ambiguous outcomes for forest protection. If unmanaged forest is converted to agriculture, the effect of lowering the decisionmaker's discount rate depends on the size of timber rents from logging <b>unmanaged</b> <b>forests.</b> If the standing timber has high commercial value, a lower discount rate would slow conversion of <b>unmanaged</b> <b>forests.</b> If the standing timber has no commercial value, logging is an investment for obtaining future benefits of alternate land use. A lower discount rate would stimulate this investment and increase the conversion of <b>unmanaged</b> <b>forests.</b> Also, if <b>unmanaged</b> <b>forests</b> are converted to managed forests, a lower discount rate can increase conversion since profits from managed forestry are higher with a lower discount rate.

40|$|Beech forests {{naturally}} regenerating from clear-cutting can exhibit different microclimates {{depending on}} size of saplings and stem density. When beech trees {{are young and}} stem density is low, the level of radiation inside the ecosystem reaching the soil surface is high; consequently, air and soil temperatures rise and the soil water content may decrease. These microclimatic parameters presumably will affect the anatomy, photosynthesis, and carbon metabolism of beech leaves. We studied the morphology and physiology of sun and shade leaves of beech trees differing in age and growing within clear-cut areas with distinct microclimate. Results were {{compared with those of}} adult trees in an <b>unmanaged</b> <b>forest.</b> We selected a stand clear-cut in 2001 (14, 000 trees ha− 1), another clear-cut in 1996 (44, 000 trees ha− 1) and an <b>unmanaged</b> <b>forest</b> (1, 000 trees ha− 1). Photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) incident on sun leaves, air temperature, soil moisture, and soil temperature within the forests affected water status and carbohydrate storage in all trees. As trees became older, PPFD also influenced pigment composition and Rubisco activity in sun leaves. On the other hand, shade leaves from the oldest trees were the most sensitive to PPFD, air temperature, and soil moisture and temperature inside the forest. Contrariwise, microclimatic parameters slightly affected the physiology of shade leaves of the beech in the stand with the highest light attenuation. Air and soil temperatures were the parameters that most affected the photosynthetic pigments and carbohydrate storage in shade leaves of the youngest trees.

40|$|The {{canonical}} {{attributes of}} old-growth forests, their importance for management approaches fostering {{the development of}} structurally complex conditions are reported. The relict presence of primary forests led {{to withdraw from the}} regular silvicultural management patches of forests and assign them to a non-intervention regime. They have been referred to as “unmanaged forest reserves”. In this context, at mid 1900, A. Pavari established a network of 24 permanent plots at the purpose of “saving from anthropogenic disturbance and studying the natural evolutive pattern of different forest types to establish well-grounded rules of management”. Most of plots set up by Pavari have nowadays lost their effectiveness because of various occurrences. Five plots are described here as for their numerical, structural and compositional dynamics. The recorded parameters draw systems that, even if far from equilibrium, show the occurrence of positive evolutive patterns. Differences to natural forests are, basically, the heritage of the previous multiple uses of forest soil and stand as well. On this basis, the component species have modified their presence in term of richness, evenness and dominance, depending on their auto-ecology, resistance or resilience. The long-term monitoring of primary forests and secondary systems left to the natural evolution finds out manifold, sound reasons today. The practice of ordinary management has been reduced greatly and the foreseeable trend is to increase further over the next period. According to its progress, many forests are experiencing a prolongation of the prearranged rotations and a post-cultivation phase is becoming the rule; stands are therefore getting older.

40|$|In the {{traditional}} forest management the non-living woody biomass in forests was perceived negatively.
