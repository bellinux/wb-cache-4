40|$|International audienceInvestigation of {{acoustical}} {{characteristics of}} biological fluids {{for the purposes}} of medical diagnostics is the important problem, because of the analysis of interaction of ultrasonic waves with biomacromolecules allows to receive the unique information on their structure and properties. One of few methods, allowing to measure velocity and absorption of ultrasound in biological fluids with sufficient precision is a method of a ultrasonic interferometer of constant length or resonator method. Acoustical resonator method for determination of lipid and protein spectra of blood serum is described. This device have two ultrasonic resonator cells with volume of 80 mkl each. The cells are placed in a specially designed <b>ultrathermostat</b> and are operated at about 8 MHz by means of compact electronic unit. The method allows to determinate without reagents lipid components (cholesterol total, cholesterol of high and low density and triglycerides), and total protein and protein fractions in blood serum during two minutes. Traditional methods determine these components during fifteen minutes and with reagents. Comparative investigations acoustics and traditional methods shows very high correlation agreements...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} {{the measurement of}} heat transfer coefficient for the refrigerator’s condenser in free convection regime. The water was pumped through the steel coils of heat exchanger with a constant flow rate and its temperature was kept at a demanded value by means of <b>ultrathermostat.</b> The research was conducted in stationary conditions which were controlled by a continuous measurement of the water temperature at inflow and outflow to the heat exchanger. The temperature distribution at the external condenser surface was registered {{by means of an}} infrared camera. Single elements used to the analysis were selected using the thermogram registered. In free convection regime and in case of small temperature change the heat transfer coefficient value can be calculated by comparing the measured temperature area with analytical solution describing one-dimensional temperature distribution along the rib. The accuracy of the proposed method for measuring the heat transfer coefficient was examined by comparing the heat transferred to the air and the heat lost by water flowing through the spiral of heat exchanger. An error between these two parameters is about 6 %. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{brassinosteroids}} on {{the resistance of}} millet plants (Panicum miliaceum L.) to damaging heating and soil drought was investigated. The pretreatment of the seeds with 20 nM of 24 -epibrassinolide and 28 -homobrassinolide solutions increased the survival rate of seedlings after their exposure to hyperthermia (heating in bath of water <b>ultrathermostat</b> at 47 °C for 10 min). Under the influence of brassinosteroids the increase in activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and guaiacol peroxidase) and the decrease {{in the content of}} lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde in millet seedlings after heat stress were observed. In this case, the protective effect of 24 -epibrassinolide was more significant as compared to the effect of 28 -homobrassinolide. In the conditions of drought (the decrease of soil moisture to 25 % of field water capacity) plants grown from seeds treated by 24 -epibrassinolide exhibited ability for growth and higher activity of the antioxidant enzymes compared to control plants. A conclusion concerning the essential role of the induction of antioxidant enzymes in implementation of the protective effect of brassinosteroids on millet plants under abiotic stresses and the prospects of practical application of presowing treatment with them for prolonged non-specific activation of plant resistance was made...|$|E
