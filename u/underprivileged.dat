5|$|Nora Belahcen Fitzgerald first {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} of creating an organization to help Morocco's <b>underprivileged</b> women through career training in 2006 after meeting a single mother begging on the street who lived on 2030 dirhams per day (about €2.70, $3.40 in 2006). Belahcen Fitzgerald was inspired by the Association Solidarité Féminine, which helps single mothers overcome poverty and social stigma by providing them with shelter, counselling, and vocational training. She decided to begin helping women by teaching them to make baked goods in her family's language center. This proved to be successful, and the participants were able to make more money using their new skills than by begging. In 2008, Belahcen Fitzgerald began hiring <b>underprivileged</b> Moroccan women to cook for events she organized for her friends.|$|E

5|$|Tuberculosis {{is closely}} linked to both {{overcrowding}} and malnutrition, {{making it one of}} the principal diseases of poverty. Those at high risk thus include: people who inject illicit drugs, inhabitants and employees of locales where vulnerable people gather (e.g. prisons and homeless shelters), medically <b>underprivileged</b> and resource-poor communities, high-risk ethnic minorities, children in close contact with high-risk category patients, and health-care providers serving these patients.|$|E
5|$|At Horace Mann Elementary School in Seattle {{during the}} mid-1950s, Hendrix's habit of {{carrying}} a broom {{with him to}} emulate a guitar gained {{the attention of the}} school's social worker. After {{more than a year of}} his clinging to a broom like a security blanket, she wrote a letter requesting school funding intended for <b>underprivileged</b> children, insisting that leaving him without a guitar might result in psychological damage. Her efforts failed, and Al refused to buy him a guitar.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{appointment}} as a judge, Hand became politically {{active in the}} cause of New Nationalism. With reservations, in 1911 he supported Theodore Roosevelt's return to national politics. He approved of the former president's plans to legislate on behalf of the <b>underprivileged</b> and to control corporations, as well as of his campaign against the abuse of judicial power. Hand sought to influence Roosevelt's views on these subjects, both in person and in print, and wrote articles for Roosevelt's magazine, The Outlook. His hopes of swaying Roosevelt were often dashed. Roosevelt's poor grasp of legal issues particularly exasperated Hand.|$|E
5|$|He {{funded the}} {{formation}} of a Young Men's Christian Association in Kokomo where he and his son became active. Haynes taught swimming classes and regularly took <b>underprivileged</b> young boys to movies and bought them dinners. After several years of active membership at the local level, he was elected president of the national YMCA in 1919 and served two one-year terms. His primary focus during his tenure was the launching of several successful membership drives. In 1920, he was appointed to the Indiana State Board of Education by Governor James P. Goodrich where he advocated increased state funding for vocational education.|$|E

5|$|In the 1947–48 season, the England cricket team {{toured the}} West Indies. When the team played in Trinidad, Ganteaume scored 101 and 47 not {{out in the}} first match but journalists criticised him for scoring slowly in easy batting conditions. In a second match against the touring side, he scored 5 and 90 but was not {{selected}} in the team for the Test match which followed—Ganteaume later suggested his non-selection was a result of his <b>underprivileged</b> background. However, an injury to Jeff Stollmeyer, one of the West Indies' opening batsmen, before the game meant that Ganteaume was called up into the side.|$|E
5|$|The Columbia International Relations Council and Association (CIRCA), oversees Columbia's Model United Nations activities. CIRCA hosts {{college and}} high school Model UN conferences, hosts {{speakers}} influential in international politics to speak on campus, trains students from <b>underprivileged</b> schools in New York in ModelUN and oversees a competitive team, which travels to colleges {{around the country and}} to an international conference every year.

5|$|The {{company has}} {{emphasized}} outreach to <b>underprivileged</b> schools in its business decisions. As of 2015, more than 35,000 schools use Flocabulary {{products in the}} classroom. Flocabulary has been praised by rapper Snoop Dogg, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, and historian Howard Zinn, and the company's products have been generally well received by educators and the press. However, the project {{has been criticized for}} perceived cultural inauthenticity and politically charged material in some song lyrics.|$|E

5|$|With the {{establishment}} of SCORE and the associated potential of 1.6 million more jobs by 2030, the state government allocated RM1 billion from 2016 to 2020 to a Skills Development Fund for vocational education. In 2015, Petronas provided vocational scholarships to 150 <b>underprivileged</b> Sarawak students {{as part of its}} Vocational Institution Sponsorship and Training Assistance program, although it had been criticised for under-representing local students in its previous allocations; the company also provided support to other Sarawak vocational education centres.|$|E
5|$|Charles Voorhis's {{job with}} Nash {{had taken him}} to {{a new home in}} Kenosha, Wisconsin; Jerry Voorhis joined his parents there on his return from Europe. As part of his {{recovery}} from his illness, he spent several weeks in northwestern Wyoming, working on a ranch. In Kenosha, he met a social worker named Alice Louise Livingston and married her on November 27, 1924, in her hometown of Washington, Iowa. Resuming his blue-collar career after his marriage, Voorhis moved to North Carolina with his wife and went to work in a Ford plant in Charlotte until being offered work as a teacher in an Illinois school for <b>underprivileged</b> boys, teaching three grades, coaching sports, and giving religious talks in the school's chapel each morning. This was followed by a year in Laramie, Wyoming, where the Voorhises founded and ran an orphanage for boys.|$|E
5|$|Gaddafi briefly studied History at the University of Libya in Benghazi, before {{dropping}} out {{to join the}} military. Despite his police record, in 1963 he began training at the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi, alongside several like-minded friends from Misrata. The armed forces offered the only opportunity for upward social mobility for <b>underprivileged</b> Libyans, and Gaddafi recognized it as a potential instrument of political change. Under Idris, Libya's armed forces were trained by the British military; this angered Gaddafi, who viewed the British as imperialists, and accordingly he refused to learn English and was rude to the British officers, ultimately failing his exams. British trainers reported him for insubordination and abusive behaviour, stating their suspicion {{that he was involved}} in the assassination of the military academy's commander in 1963. Such reports were ignored and Gaddafi quickly progressed through the course.|$|E
5|$|In Syria, ethnic {{minorities}} were often <b>underprivileged,</b> and a specific ethnicity often {{belonged to a}} specific social class. The Alawites, the Druzes and the Isma'ilis for instance, were ethnic groups with low social class who began to embrace a radical form of Arab nationalism, e.g. Ba'athism. Without the peasantry there {{could not have been}} a Ba'athist revolution in Syria. The new middle class alone could only produce instability, but together with the peasantry, the revolution became possible. The inequality between urban and rural dwellers, together with capitalist penetration of the agrarian sector and the traditional elites' monopolisation of most large revenue sources, led to the establishment of peasant movements who fought for change, or opposed the system. The Syrian branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party was able to recruit young peasants from radical peasant movements, and because of it, was able to mobilise large sectors of the population.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19thcentury, other aristocratic women {{began to turn}} away from refined society life and focused on feminist reform. Among them was Anna Pavlovna Filosofova, a woman from an aristocratic Moscow family married to a {{high-ranking}} bureaucrat, who devoted her energy to various societies and projects to benefit the poor and <b>underprivileged</b> in Russian society, including women. Together with Maria Trubnikova, Nadezhda Stasova and Evgenia Konradi, she lobbied the Emperor to create and fund higher education courses for women. She was also {{a founding member of the}} Russian Women's Mutual Philanthropic Society and responsible for helping to organize the All-Women's Congress of 1908.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) announces to {{the staff}} of The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) that she is {{participating}} in a charity which provides gifts to <b>underprivileged</b> children who write letters to Santa. She buys far more than what is requested in the letter, wanting to see the children's happiness. When Liz delivers the presents to the apartment in the letter, however, the door is answered by two adults who take the gifts, and she believes she has been tricked. Receiving no help from the US Postal Service, who run the charity, she attempts to have it shut down. This upsets Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) who refuses to believe anyone would scam a Christmas charity. She takes Kenneth back to the apartment to prove she was right, but two children answer the door and Liz accidentally reveals to them that Santa Claus is not real.|$|E
5|$|Payton's legacy {{continues}} through the charitable Walter and Connie Payton Foundation. His own appeals—and after his death, his foundation's—for {{greater awareness of}} the need for organ donations are widely credited with bringing national attention to the problem. After his appeals, donations in Illinois skyrocketed, and the regional organ bank of Illinois was overwhelmed with calls. In response, the City of Chicago inserted organ donation requests into city-vehicle-registration mailings in early 2000, and by August 2000, 13,000 people had signed on to the program. The foundation continues to run a program that Payton organized to donate toys to <b>underprivileged</b> children across the Chicago area each Christmas. The family established the Walter Payton Cancer Fund in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Philibert Rabezoza (1923 – 29 September 2001), {{better known}} by the name Rakoto Frah, was a flautist and {{composer}} of traditional music of the central highlands of Madagascar. Born in 1923 near {{the capital city of}} Antananarivo to a poor rural family, Rakoto Frah surmounted the challenges posed by his <b>underprivileged</b> origins to become the most acclaimed 20th century performer of the sodina flute, one of the oldest traditional instruments on the island. Through frequent international concerts and music festival performances, he promoted the music of the highlands of Madagascar and {{became one of the most}} famous Malagasy artists, both within Madagascar and on the world music scene.|$|E

5|$|Sober {{for four}} years {{by the time he}} began his second tenure with the Flames in 2013, McGrattan had also become a mentor and friend to former Nashville {{teammate}} Jordin Tootoo in his own efforts to overcome similar addictions. McGrattan's experiences led to a desire to help others; he partnered with the NHL substance abuse program to act as a mentor for others who wanted the advice of a fellow player, and plans to spend his off-seasons earning a university degree in addiction counseling. McGrattan is also an advocate for anti-bullying charities and volunteers with Be The Game, a camp that supports <b>underprivileged</b> kids.|$|E
5|$|The Saint Lucia School of Music is an {{independent}} institute of music education that has two branches on the island, one {{in the north and}} one in the south. It was established in 1987, and has a student body of around four hundred students. The School's professed goal is to provide music education at all levels, to offer community opportunities for musical enrichment, to facilitate the training and professional development of educators, and to establish the school as a musical resource. There is also a notable music Education Centre operated by a vocal group from the fishing village Anse la Raye; this Centre provides music education opportunities for gifted and <b>underprivileged</b> children from across the island.|$|E
5|$|The general {{atmosphere}} of enrichment and satisfaction {{during the period}} of economic growth in Côte d'Ivoire made it possible for Houphouët-Boigny to maintain and control internal political tensions. His easygoing authoritarian regime, where political prisoners were almost nonexistent, was well accepted by the population. However, the economic crisis that began in the 1980s caused a sharp decline in living conditions for the middle class and <b>underprivileged</b> urban populations. According to the World Bank, the population living below the poverty threshold went from 11% in 1985 to 31% by 1993. Despite the implementation of certain measures, such as the reduction of the number of young French workers (who worked abroad while serving in the military) from 3,000 to 2,000 in 1986, allowing many jobs to go to young Ivorian graduates, the government failed to control the rising rates of unemployment and bankruptcy in many companies.|$|E
5|$|Winners of the Branch Rickey Award have {{undertaken}} different causes. Many winners, including Todd Stottlemyre, Jamie Moyer, John Smoltz, Torii Hunter, Vernon Wells, and Shane Victorino, worked {{with children in}} need. Stottlemyre visited and raised money for a nine-year-old girl who suffered from aplastic anemia and required a bone marrow transplant, while Moyer's foundation raised US$6million to support <b>underprivileged</b> children. Other winners devoted their work to aiding individuals who had a specific illness, such as Curt Schilling, who raised money for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Trevor Hoffman, who lost a kidney as an infant and devoted himself to working with individuals with nephropathy. Also, some winners devoted themselves to work with major disasters and tragedies. Bobby Valentine donated money to charities benefiting victims of the September 11 attacks, while Luis Gonzalez worked with survivors of Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
5|$|Yao {{has also}} participated in many charity events during his career, {{including}} the NBA's Basketball Without Borders program. In the NBA's offseason in 2003, Yao hosted a telethon, which raised 300,000U.S. dollars to help {{stop the spread of}} SARS. In September 2007, he held an auction that raised 965,000U.S. dollars (6.75million yuan), and competed in a charity basketball match to raise money for <b>underprivileged</b> children in China. He was joined by fellow NBA stars Steve Nash, Carmelo Anthony, and Baron Davis, and movie star Jackie Chan. After the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Yao donated $2million to relief work, and created a foundation to help rebuild schools destroyed in the earthquake.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire was swept by a wave of reforms meant to {{centralise}} and Europeanise the government of the state. Bosnian Muslim feudal lords rejected the reforms and repeatedly revolted against the Sultan. The Ottoman military intervened in the Eyalet of Bosnia in 1831 and 1850, crushing the local feudal lords, and the set of modernising reforms known as the Tanzimat began to be implemented in the province. The Christians were <b>underprivileged</b> in the Ottoman Empire, and this was even more so in Bosnia than in the rest of the empire. An improvement in this respect occurred in 1862, when the Bosnian Christians (Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats) were granted more rights, including those to open new churches and to run their own schools. This came after several uprisings by the Christians, especially Serbs, who had the strongest national movement in the province. Ivan Franjo Jukić and other Bosnian Franciscans requested the right to establish a printing house in 1847, 1850, 1853, and 1857, but each time their requests were denied by the Ottoman government.|$|E
5|$|Kapoor {{practices}} vegetarianism, and {{credits the}} author Brian Hines' book Life is Fair for influencing this lifestyle choice. He also supports charitable organisations for various causes. In 2010, he {{took part in}} a charity event named Superstars Ka Jalwa, which helped generate money for the employees of the Cine and Television Artists Association (CINTAA). Also that year, he lent his support to the NGO Swayamsiddh, which helps children with special needs.

He supports the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals organisation through advertisement campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Ripken {{has made}} {{donations}} to many various charitable causes, including donations supporting research on Lou Gehrig's disease. After he broke Gehrig's record, the Orioles, along with private donors, created the Cal Ripken/Lou Gehrig Fund for Neuromuscular Research at Johns Hopkins University.
