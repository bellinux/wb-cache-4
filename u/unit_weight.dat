5|$|Beryllium is a steel {{gray and}} hard metal that is brittle at room {{temperature}} and has a close-packed hexagonal crystal structure. It has exceptional stiffness (Young's modulus 287 GPa) and a reasonably high melting point. The modulus of elasticity of beryllium is approximately 50% {{greater than that of}} steel. The combination of this modulus and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast sound conduction speed in beryllium – about 12.9km/s at ambient conditions. Other significant properties are high specific heat (1925 J·kg−1·K−1) and thermal conductivity (216 W·m−1·K−1), which make beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per <b>unit</b> <b>weight.</b> In combination with the relatively low coefficient of linear thermal expansion (11.4×10−6 K−1), these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading.|$|E

5000|$|Another robust {{method is}} the use of <b>unit</b> <b>weights</b> (Wainer & Thissen, 1976), a method that can be applied when there are {{multiple}} predictors of a single outcome. Ernest Burgess (1928) used <b>unit</b> <b>weights</b> to predict success on parole. He scored 21 positive factors as present (e.g., [...] "no prior arrest" [...] = 1) or absent ("prior arrest" [...] = 0), then summed to yield a predictor score, which was shown to be a useful predictor of parole success. Samuel S. Wilks (1938) showed that nearly all sets of regression weights sum to composites that are very highly correlated with one another, including <b>unit</b> <b>weights,</b> a result referred to as Wilk's theorem (Ree, Carretta, & Earles, 1998). Robyn Dawes (1979) examined decision making in applied settings, showing that simple models with <b>unit</b> <b>weights</b> often outperformed human experts. Bobko, Roth, and Buster (2007) reviewed the literature on <b>unit</b> <b>weights,</b> and they concluded that decades of empirical studies show that <b>unit</b> <b>weights</b> perform similar to ordinary regression weights on cross validation.|$|R

Throughout the last three decades, there have been {{repeated}} attempts to incorporate phrases in the automatic indexing and retrieval. However, the improvements gained through the use of phrases have counter-intuitively always been quite small. In this paper, we examines the effectiveness of different probability-based compound <b>unit</b> <b>weighting</b> methods for Chinese text retrieval. We focus on comparing and analysing different compound <b>unit</b> <b>weighting</b> methods. Experimental results for these comparisons on TREC Chinese text collections are reported, which show that proper design of boost weights is important to the performance of compound <b>unit</b> <b>weighting...</b>|$|R

25|$|Alcohol fuels {{have less}} energy per <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> and unit volume than gasoline. To make it {{possible}} to compare the net energy released per cycle a measure called the fuels specific energy is sometimes used. It is defined as the energy released per air fuel ratio. The net energy released per cycle is higher for butanol than ethanol or methanol and about 10% higher than for gasoline.|$|E

25|$|Charcoal, or Makala, is inefficient {{to produce}} {{but is a}} {{preferred}} source {{of energy in the}} DRC. While it is virtually free to use fuelwood as a source of energy, charcoal increases in popularity as an energy source due to several advantages over fuelwood. Charcoal has higher calorific value per <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> (31.8 MJ per kg) compared to fuelwood (16 MJ per kg); and charcoal is smaller and easier to store.|$|E

As {{the cost of}} natural rubber has risen significantly and rubber products are dense, the shipping methods offer the lowest cost per <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> are preferred. Depending on destination, warehouse availability, and transportation conditions, some methods are preferred by certain buyers. In international trade, latex rubber is mostly shipped in 20-foot ocean containers. Inside the container, smaller containers are used to store the latex.|$|E
25|$|The {{radiation}} {{absorbed dose}} {{is the amount}} energy absorbed per <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> of the target material. Dose is used because, when the same substance is given the same dose, similar changes are observed in the target material. The SI unit for dose is grays (Gy or J/kg). Dosimeters are used to measure dose, and are small components that, when exposed to ionizing radiation, change measurable physical attributes {{to a degree that}} can be correlated to the dose received. Measuring dose (dosimetry) involves exposing one or more dosimeters along with the target material.|$|E

25|$|Fuel {{efficiency}} {{is a form}} of thermal efficiency, meaning the efficiency of a process that converts chemical potential energy contained in a carrier fuel into kinetic energy or work. The fuel economy is the energy efficiency of a particular vehicle, is given as a ratio of distance travelled per unit of fuel consumed. Weight-specific efficiency (efficiency per <b>unit</b> <b>weight)</b> may be stated for freight, and passenger-specific efficiency (vehicle efficiency per passenger). The inefficient atmospheric combustion (burning) of fossil fuels in vehicles, buildings, and power plants contributes to urban heat islands.|$|E
25|$|Producers {{and sellers}} of popcorn {{consider}} two major factors {{in evaluating the}} quality of popcorn: what percentage of the kernels will pop, and how much each popped kernel expands. Expansion is an important factor to both the consumer and vendor. For the consumer, larger pieces of popcorn tend to be more tender and are associated with higher quality. For the grower, distributor, and vendor, expansion is closely correlated with profit: vendors such as theaters buy popcorn by weight and sell it by volume. For both these reasons, higher-expansion popcorn fetches a higher profit per <b>unit</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|E
25|$|Air {{pollutant}} emission factors are reported representative values {{that attempt to}} relate the quantity of a pollutant released to the ambient air with an activity associated {{with the release of}} that pollutant. These factors are usually expressed as the weight of pollutant divided by a <b>unit</b> <b>weight,</b> volume, distance, or duration of the activity emitting the pollutant (e.g., kilograms of particulate emitted per tonne of coal burned). Such factors facilitate estimation of emissions from various sources of air pollution. In most cases, these factors are simply averages of all available data of acceptable quality, and are generally assumed to be representative of long-term averages.|$|E

25|$|Soft hammer {{finished}} {{pieces are}} usually balanced, symmetrical {{and can be}} relatively smooth. Soft hammer works {{first appeared in the}} Acheulean period, allowing tools with these markings {{to be used as a}} post quem estimation, but with no greater precision. The main advantage of a soft hammer is that a flintknapper is able to remove broader, thinner flakes with barely developed heels, which allows a cutting edge to be maintained or even improved with minimal raw material wastage. However, a high-quality raw material is required to make their use effective. No studies compare the two methods in terms of yield per <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> of raw material, or the difference in energy use. The use of a soft hammer requires greater use of force by the flintknapper and a steeper learning curve, although it offers more flakes for less raw material.|$|E
25|$|A rush {{typically}} {{begins with}} the discovery of placer gold made by an individual. At first the gold may be washed from the sand and gravel by individual miners with little training, using a gold pan or similar simple instrument. Once {{it is clear that the}} volume of gold-bearing sediment is larger than a few cubic metres, the placer miners will build rockers or sluice boxes, with which a small group can wash gold from the sediment many times faster than using gold pans. Winning the gold in this manner requires almost no capital investment, only a simple pan or equipment that may be built on the spot, and only simple organisation. The low investment, the high value per <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> of gold, and the ability of gold dust and gold nuggets to serve as a medium of exchange, allow placer gold rushes to occur even in remote locations.|$|E
25|$|Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (C12H25NaO4S; mW: 288.38) (only used in {{denaturing}} protein gels) is {{a strong}} detergent agent used to denature native proteins to individual polypeptides. This denaturation, which {{is referred to as}} reconstructive denaturation, is not accomplished by the total linearization of the protein, but instead, through a conformational change to a combination of random coil and α helix secondary structures. When a protein mixture is heated to 100°C in presence of SDS, the detergent wraps around the polypeptide backbone. It binds to polypeptides in a constant weight ratio of 1.4 g SDS/g of polypeptide. In this process, the intrinsic charges of polypeptides become negligible when compared to the negative charges contributed by SDS. Thus polypeptides after treatment become rod-like structures possessing a uniform charge density, that is same net negative charge per <b>unit</b> <b>weight.</b> The electrophoretic mobilities of these proteins is a linear function of the logarithms of their molecular weights. Without SDS, different proteins with similar molecular weights would migrate differently due to differences in mass-charge ratio, as each protein has an isoelectric point and molecular weight particular to its primary structure. This is known as native PAGE. Adding SDS solves this problem, as it binds to and unfolds the protein, giving a near uniform negative charge {{along the length of the}} polypeptide.|$|E

Wilks described how <b>unit</b> <b>weights</b> could be used in practical settings, when data were not available to estimate beta weights. For example, a small college may want to select good students for admission. But the school may have no money to gather data and conduct a standard multiple regression analysis. In this case, the school could use several predictors—high school grades, SAT scores, teacher ratings. Wilks (1938) showed mathematically why <b>unit</b> <b>weights</b> should work well in practice.|$|R
