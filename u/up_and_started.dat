25|$|Instead of slowing, George {{kept the}} pace, and Cummings {{struggled}} to keep up. Halfway through the final lap, Cummings gave <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>started</b> to walk, and since winning was the main concern today, George slowed to a walk when he was far enough ahead. Cummings, urged by his boosters, started to run again, which caused George to start to run again. He beat Cummings by some 65 yards {{in a time of}} 4:20, remarkably fast given his leisurely last lap.|$|E
25|$|Short track {{speed skating}} was {{dominated}} by South Korea, who won {{four of the six}} events. After the discipline's debut in 1992, the 1994 featured two new events, the men's 500 meters and the women's 1000 meters. South Korea's Chae Ji-Hoon won the men's 500 meters, while taking silver on the 1000 meters behind countryman Kim Ki-Hoon, who defended his 1992 gold. The bronze was won by Canada's Marc Gagnon, who won the B final. In the A final, countryman Derrick Campbell was obstructed by Great Britain's Nicky Gooch, who was disqualified.

25|$|The Sentry {{was being}} {{operated}} by the 962nd Airborne Air Control Squadron and was scheduled for a training sortie with the callsign Yukla 27. The aircraft was to depart from runway 06 and was waiting while a Hercules transport aircraft took off ahead of it. With its crew unaware that the Hercules had disturbed a flock of Canada geese, the Sentry lined <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>started</b> its departure roll. As the E-3 rotated it ingested multiple birds into its number 1 and 2 engines. The crew started to dump fuel and initiated a turn to the left {{to return to the}} airfield, but with a full fuel load and having lost two engines on the same wing, it was unable to maintain altitude. After the aircraft reached 250 feet it descended and crashed into a hilly, wooded area, and exploded.|$|E
25|$|Ali stood <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>started</b> towards Angelo Dundee who {{guided him}} into the corner. At first Dundee talked and slapped Ali's legs, but after Ali {{misunderstood}} {{and tried to get}} off the stool, Dundee used smelling salts. Dundee has since claimed to have opened a small tear in one of Ali's gloves and told the referee that his fighter needed a new pair of gloves, thus delaying the start of the 5th round. Cooper insisted that this delay lasted anywhere from three to five seconds according to the footage and that this did not deny him the chance to try to knock Ali out while he was still dazed. Tapes of the fight show that Ali received only an extra six seconds, and the gloves were ultimately not replaced. Cooper started the 5th round aggressively, attempting to make good on his advantage, but a recovered Ali effectively countered and Cooper was hit high on the face with a hard right which opened a severe cut under his eye. Referee Tommy Little was forced to stop the fight, and thus Ali defeated Cooper by technical knockout.|$|E
25|$|On {{the opening}} drive of the game, Brunell led the Jaguars 73 yards in nine plays, {{featuring}} a 41-yard completion to Smith, {{and finished the}} drive with an 8-yard touchdown pass to Smith 4:28 into the game. After the ensuing kickoff, Jacksonville cornerback Aaron Beasley intercepted Marino's first pass {{of the game and}} returned it five yards to the Dolphins 41-yard line, setting a 45-yard field goal from Mike Hollis. Following a three-and-out for Miami, Tom Hutton's 57-yard punt pinned the Jaguars back at their own 9-yard line. But two plays later, Taylor took off down the right sideline for an NFL playoff record 90-yard touchdown run. Then on Miami's next possession, defensive end Tony Brackens forced a fumble from Marino and dove on the ball. With most players on both teams thinking he was down by contact, Brackens got <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>started</b> celebrating while the Dolphins offense walked off the field, but his teammate Bryce Paup realized that no one had touched Brackens and the play was still ongoing. He ran up to Brackens, shoved him in the back, and told him to start running, and Brackens ended up returning the ball 16 yards for a touchdown.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the 18th century, Golden Rock, was earlier {{referred}} by Robert Orme to the British as Sugar-Loaf Rock, where after the Battle of Golden Rock, the erstwhile Trichinopoly {{was divided into}} two parts, one called the Cantonment, which contains the residences of European & Anglo-Indian community and the garrison-barracks for stationing the European and Indian Regiments. The cantonment then comprised the present day areas of Cantonment, Tiruchirappalli Junction, Senthaneerpuram, Varahaneri, Golden Rock, Tiruchirapalli Central Prison and other major parts of southern and eastern trichy. During 1878, when the Afghan War broke, {{the whole of the}} European troops were withdrawn. According to Oral lore, some parts of the barracks were converted to dispensary and clinic. Later, the buildings were transformed for Cholera/T.B. Hospital and again as barracks and again to hospital, which was mostly devoted and preferred for the Europeans and Anglo-Indians. Around the 1920s, provision was contemplated for a Railway School since there were considerations to move the railway workshop from Negapatnam to Trichinopoly, for strategic purposes, for which foundations were laid in 1926 and permanently moved in 1928. Around the same time, two Railway schools at primary level in English Medium and Tamil Medium were established during 1923 and 1925 respectively along with an exclusive Divisional Railway Hospital was also set <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>started</b> to function here since 1927. Post-independence the administration was transferred to Indian railways, which opened many more such schools, where quality education is provided at subsidized cost to about one lakh children of railway employees and about 30,000 non-railway wards. There are about 5,500 teachers and about 1,100 non-teaching staff employed in these railway schools. Indian Railways also supports many Kendriya Vidyalayas for the benefit of wards of railway employees.|$|E

Speaking in 2009, she {{reflected}} {{that they were}} close because sex was never an issue for them. Although the headlines in the media referred to Shields' talking about an [...] "asexual Jackson" [...] after his death, what she actually said was, “As he grew older and the more he started to change physically, the more asexual he became to me.” She also said that as she grew <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>started</b> having boyfriends, she would confide in him about her intimate experiences, as he was curious. She said, [...] "he was {{like a little kid}} who talked about the bases – what first base was, what second base was" [...] – and his curiosity was understandable given his guarded life.|$|E

Shakur is no longer Catholic. She later earned a General Educational Development (GED) with her aunt's help. Often there were few, or no other black students in her high school class. Shakur later wrote teachers seemed surprised when she answered a question in class, as if not expecting black people to be intelligent and engaged, and what she was taught a sugar-coated version of history that ignored the oppression suffered by people of color, especially in the United States. In her autobiography she later wrote: “I didn’t know what a fool they had made out of me until I grew <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>started</b> to read real history”.|$|E

500|$|Growing up, Perry and her {{siblings}} {{were not allowed}} to eat the cereal Lucky Charms as the term [...] "luck" [...] reminded their mother of Lucifer, and had to call deviled eggs [...] "angeled eggs". Perry primarily listened to gospel music, as secular music was generally discouraged in the family's home. She discovered popular music through CDs she sneaked from her friends. While not strictly identifying as religious, Perry has stated, [...] "I pray all the time– for self-control, for humility." [...] Following her sister Angela, Perry began singing by practicing with her sister's cassette tapes. She performed the tracks in front of their parents, who suggested she take vocal lessons. She began training at age 9, and was incorporated into her parents' ministry, singing in church from ages 9 to 17. At 13, Perry was given her first guitar for her birthday, and publicly performed songs she wrote. She tried to [...] "be a bit like the typical Californian girl" [...] while growing <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>started</b> rollerskating, skateboarding, and surfing as a teenager. David described her as a tomboy during her adolescence. She took dancing lessons and learned how to swing, Lindy Hop, and jitterbug.|$|E
500|$|The {{next day}} {{it was decided to}} make a {{dismounted}} attack on Hill 3039, outside Amman. The regiment, while still holding its own lines, provided eleven officers and 102 other ranks {{to take part in the}} assault. At 02:00 they formed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>started</b> forward, the regiment's contingent forming the second line with the Wellington Mounted Rifles. The assault was successful, the first line capturing their objectives. The second line passed through them onto their objectives. With around [...] to go, Turkish machine-guns opened fire on them, but they pressed on, capturing a machine-gun and fourteen prisoners. Then the 8th Squadron moved forward with the 4th (ANZAC) Battalion, Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, and captured the last Turkish position on the hill. The brigade settled in to defend the hill, the regiment located between the brigade's other two units. At dawn Turkish artillery targeted the hill, and at 09:30 the Turks counter-attacked the New Zealanders. They were stopped by the brigade, using captured machine-guns in addition to their own weapons. Turkish artillery continued to bombard the hill until 16:00, when another counter-attack began, mostly to the regiment's left; this was driven off. The third counter-attack came an hour later but was also defeated. Elsewhere the rest of the division had been trying to reach Amman but could not make any progress.|$|E
500|$|The Long Branch Saloon Shootout, {{involving}} Levi Richardson, {{a buffalo}} hunter, and [...] "Cockeyed Frank" [...] Loving, a professional gambler, happened on April 5, 1879. Richardson had developed some affection for Loving's wife Mattie, {{and the two}} began to argue about her. In the saloon, Frank sat down at a long table, Richardson turned around and took {{a seat at the}} same table. The two were then heard speaking in low voices. After the conversation, Richardson drew his pistol, and Loving drew his in response. The Long Branch Saloon was then filled with smoke. Dodge City Marshal Charlie Bassett, who was in Beatty & Kelley's Saloon, heard the shots and came running. Both men were still standing, although Richardson had fired five shots from his gun and Loving's Remington No. 44 was empty. Deputy Sheriff Duffey threw Richardson down in a chair and took his gun, while Bassett disarmed Loving. Richardson then got <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>started</b> toward the billiard table, when he fell to the floor with a fatal gunshot in the chest, as well as a shot through the side and another through the right arm. Frank Loving, who had only a slight scratch on the hand, was immediately taken to jail. Two days later, the coroner's inquest ruled that the killing had been in self-defense and Loving was immediately released.|$|E

500|$|Michael Tedder of Vulture wrote {{positively}} of {{the episode}} and awarded it {{four out of five}} stars. He called the final fight between Pam and Jim [...] "ugly and real" [...] and one in which [...] "the writers didn't flinch", in that it truly made him feel uncomfortable. Tedder complimented both Fischer and Krasinski, and wrote that Krasinski [...] "doesn't try to make Jim look charming in this fight, just terrified and exhausted." [...] He called Nellie's subplot [...] "the best use of this new version of Nellie", but wrote that Dwight and Darryl's subplot was undeveloped. Rick Porter of Zap2it felt that, while the episode was [...] "up and down" [...] (he wrote that Dwight and Darryl's subplot was [...] "flat", but that Erin and Pete's yielded several humorous lines) the final confrontation between Jim and Pam was [...] "a big dose of reality" [...] and that it was not [...] "a contrived fight". David Wilcox of The Citizen wrote that the fight between Pam and Jim was [...] "welcome" [...] because their relationship had grown stale ever since they had [...] "hooked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>started</b> living their perfect little lives together." [...] Wilcox praised {{the way in which the}} fight was written, and wrote that he [...] "couldn't help smiling. Not because the fight wasn't wrenching to watch. But because it was." [...] Cindy White of IGN awarded the episode a 7.8 out of 10, denoting a [...] "good" [...] episode. She reasoned that while the episode was funny but largely forgettable, the final scene made it worth watching.|$|E
500|$|Television pundits have criticised {{the writing}} of the programme; Robert Hanks of The Independent calls the scripts [...] "often corny, even painfully so", using Monty Everard's line [...] "You'll come to regret {{crossing}} swords with me, sir!" [...] from [...] "Health Hazard" [...] (2003) as an example. Hanks also wrote about what he called [...] "moral oversimplification" [...] of the storylines; the same episode featured [...] "a wealthy and self-important businessman—who had already been banned from talking on a mobile phone while driving—ran over and killed a mother and her two small children while talking on his mobile phone to his mistress, to whom he was explaining that he had to take his wife to a function at—the icing on this shabby cake—Downing Street. He then legged it and subsequently faked mental illness to avoid a trial; a gambit that might have worked had Deed not cunningly threatened to send him to Broadmoor, at which point the man stood <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>started</b> protesting vociferously". The series is frequently lampooned for its dialogue and unlikely scenarios. Andy Hamilton called the dialogue [...] "the funniest on TV" [...] and David Mitchell selected it as his [...] "TV hell" [...] in the series TV Heaven, Telly Hell. Deed's [...] "swashbuckling" [...] persona has been satirised on the sketch series Dead Ringers. Despite the criticism given to the programme, the series is praised as being at its best when tackling topical issues, such as the MMR vaccine, human exposure to telephone masts and incestuous relationships.|$|E
