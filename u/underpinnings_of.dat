5|$|The <b>underpinnings</b> <b>of</b> {{the local}} economy are based on Moncton's {{heritage}} as a commercial, distribution, transportation, and retailing centre. This is due to Moncton's central location in the Maritimes: it has the largest catchment area in Atlantic Canada with 1.6 million people living within a three-hour drive of the city. The insurance, information technology, educational, and health care sectors also are major factors in {{the local economy}} with the city's two hospitals alone employing over five thousand people.|$|E
5|$|Though these {{theories}} of memory formation are now well established, they were farsighted for their time: late 19th and early 20th century neuroscientists and psychologists were not {{equipped with the}} neurophysiological techniques necessary for elucidating the biological <b>underpinnings</b> <b>of</b> learning in animals. These skills would not come until the later half of the 20th century, {{at about the same}} time as the discovery of long-term potentiation.|$|E
5|$|Asperger {{syndrome}} {{appears to}} result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems, as opposed to localized effects. Although the specific <b>underpinnings</b> <b>of</b> AS or factors that distinguish it from other ASDs are unknown, and no clear pathology common to individuals with AS has emerged, {{it is still possible}} that AS's mechanism is separate from other ASDs. Neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that the mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception. Abnormal migration of embryonic cells during fetal development may affect the final structure and connectivity of the brain, resulting in alterations in the neural circuits that control thought and behavior. Several theories of mechanism are available; none are likely to provide a complete explanation.|$|E

5|$|By {{the years}} of unification, German Jews played an {{important}} role in the intellectual <b>underpinnings</b> <b>of</b> the German professional, intellectual, and social life. The expulsion of Jews from Russia in the 1880s and 1890s complicated integration into the German public sphere. Russian Jews arrived in north German cities in the thousands; considerably less educated and less affluent, their often dismal poverty dismayed many of the Germanized Jews. Many of the problems related to poverty (such as illness, overcrowded housing, unemployment, school absenteeism, refusal to learn German, etc.) emphasized their distinctiveness for not only the Christian Germans, but for the local Jewish populations as well.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin {{mentioned}} evolutionary {{interactions between}} flowering plants and insects in On the Origin of Species (1859). The term coevolution was coined by Paul R. Ehrlich and Peter H. Raven in 1964. The theoretical <b>underpinnings</b> <b>of</b> coevolution are now well-developed, and demonstrate that coevolution {{can play an}} important role in driving major evolutionary transitions such as the evolution of sexual reproduction or shifts in ploidy. More recently, it has also been demonstrated that coevolution influences the structure and function of ecological communities as well as the dynamics of infectious disease.|$|E
5|$|Heather moor {{containing}} ling, bell heather, cross-leaved heath, {{bog myrtle}} and fescues is everywhere abundant. The high Black Cuillins weather too slowly {{to produce a}} soil that sustains a rich plant life, but each of the main peninsulas has an individual flora. The basalt <b>underpinnings</b> <b>of</b> Trotternish produce a diversity of Arctic and alpine plants including alpine pearlwort and mossy cyphal. The low-lying fields of Waternish contain corn marigold and corn spurry. The sea cliffs of Duirinish boast mountain avens and fir clubmoss. Minginish produces fairy flax, cats-ear and black bog rush. There is {{a fine example of}} Brachypodium-rich ash woodland at Tokavaig in Sleat incorporating silver birch, hazel, bird cherry, and hawthorn.|$|E

5|$|The Principia was {{published}} on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from Edmond Halley. In this work, Newton stated the three universal laws of motion. Together, these laws describe {{the relationship between}} any object, the forces acting upon it and the resulting motion, laying the foundation for classical mechanics. They contributed to many advances during the Industrial Revolution which soon followed and were not improved upon for more than 200 years. Many of these advancements {{continue to be the}} <b>underpinnings</b> <b>of</b> non-relativistic technologies in the modern world. He used the Latin word gravitas (weight) for the effect that would become known as gravity, and defined the law of universal gravitation.|$|E

50|$|Target Earth was {{a typical}} product of 1950s filmed science fiction but could never rise above its low budget <b>underpinnings.</b> One <b>of</b> the few notable aspects of the {{production}} was that the film {{was one of the}} first to explore the subgenre of alien invasions, following the success of George Pal's The War of the Worlds (1953). Target Earth was also produced by Herman Cohen, making his producing debut, who would become one of the most prominent B movie producers of the 1960s. Director Sherman A.
