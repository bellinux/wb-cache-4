2500|$|The {{original}} {{method for}} the successful ex vivo propagation of P. falciparum described culture of the parasite <b>under</b> <b>static</b> conditions (Trager-Jensen method). James B. Jensen joined Trager’s laboratory as a post-doctoral fellow in 1976. [...] He decided to employ a candlejar instead of the [...] incubator. In the summer of 1976 Milton Friedman, {{a graduate student in}} the Trager lab who was working in the MRC laboratories in The Gambia, arranged for a sample of human blood infected with P. falciparum to be sent to New York City. This was diluted with RPMI 1640 (which {{turned out to be the}} best of the commercial media) in Petri dishes, placed in a candlejar and incubated. The line grew very well and became FCR-3/Gambia, one of the most widely used strains. Later, other lines would be established using similar methods and the impact of continuous cultivation of P. falciparum was phenomenal especially for the testing of putative antimalarials and for deciphering its genes. A number of subsequent reports (from as far back as the early 1980s), showed that cell suspension (using a shaking-incubator) significantly increased culture growth. Continuous agitation has also been shown to improve other parameters of culture growth relevant to researchers, such as the prolongation of culture synchrony after synchronization procedures, and a reduction of the rate of multiple infections. [...] Despite this, the practice of culturing the parasite <b>under</b> <b>static</b> conditions remains widespread. The greatest value of the candlejar method is that it can be used in laboratories almost anywhere in the world where there is an incubator, a candle and a desiccator. Around 60% parasitized cells can be obtained using optimized culturing conditions. Recent studies of P. falciparum isolated directly from infected patients indicate that alternative parasite biological states occur in the natural host that are not observed with ex vivo cultivated parasites.|$|E
2500|$|The Pratt truss was {{patented}} in 1844 by two Boston railway engineers, Caleb Pratt {{and his son}} Thomas Willis Pratt. [...] The design uses vertical {{members for}} compression and diagonal members to respond to tension. The Pratt truss design remained popular as bridge designers switched from wood to iron, and from iron to steel. [...] This continued popularity of the Pratt truss is {{probably due to the}} fact that the configuration of the members means that longer diagonal members are only in tension for gravity load effects. [...] This allows these members to be used more efficiently, as slenderness effects related to buckling under compression loads [...] (which are compounded by the length of the member) will typically not control the design. [...] Therefore, for given planar truss with a fixed depth, the Pratt configuration is usually the most efficient <b>under</b> <b>static,</b> vertical loading.|$|E

40|$|Theaim of  {{research}} is to investigate the effect of prestrain  on the stress corossion cracking behavior of AISI 304 stainless steel in the sulfuric acid of 10 % concentration  <b>under</b> the <b>static</b> cantilever loading according to ASTM E- 1681 standart. The specimen of 304 Stainless steel was strain up over the yield strength until reaching the uniform strain of 5 % and 10 % using servopulser UTM 9506 under the  displacement control of 0, 3 mm/sec. The results of test  show that the prestrain of 5 %  specimen is faster  failure than both  of  the prestrain of 10 % and unprestrain specimen. It was caused by both of the decrease of ductility and  the short   incubation period. The change of deflection could be only recorded under  the loading 20 % of yield strength. Intergranular crack was the prestrain of 10 % specimen <b>under</b> the <b>static</b> loading of 616 MPa. Whereas,  for the prestrain of 10 % specimen transgranular crack  was found <b>under</b> the <b>static</b> loading of 554, 4 MPa. The prestrain of 5 % specimen was mixed crack  <b>under</b> the <b>static</b> loading of 369. 6 MPa.

40|$|AbstractThis article {{reports a}} novel impedance-driven flow {{apparatus}} and its applicability for studying magnesium degradation <b>under</b> flow versus <b>static</b> conditions. Magnesium has {{potential to be}} an effective biomaterial for use inside the human body due to its biodegradability and biocompatibility. Magnesium undergoes degradation reactions in aqueous solutions such as body fluids, leading to mass loss and pH increase of the surrounding fluid. To compare the degradation process of magnesium <b>under</b> flow versus <b>static</b> conditions, a novel flow apparatus consisting of an impedance pump and a flow chamber was designed and constructed. In addition to low-cost, this apparatus is flexible to be sterilized and assembled, and is small enough for use inside an incubator, making it appealing for measuring and comparing magnesium degradation in vitro <b>under</b> flow versus <b>static</b> conditions. The average flow rate in this flow apparatus was 2. 8 ml/s, mimicking the flow rate (2. 6 ml/s) in coronary artery. In a simulated body fluid (SBF), magnesium samples lost their mass at a much faster rate under the flow condition than that <b>under</b> the <b>static</b> condition. Starting with a pH of 7. 4, the SBF showed a pH increase to 8. 5 under the flow condition within 96 h due to the degradation of magnesium, greater than the pH increase <b>under</b> the <b>static</b> condition. The results of this study demonstrated the effects of fluid flow on magnesium degradation using the impedance-driven flow apparatus, providing useful design guidelines for magnesium-based implants that may be exposed to body fluid flow...|$|R

In order to implement the method, a specific computer program for a 2 D linear elastic analysis of infilled plane frames <b>under</b> lateral <b>static</b> loads has been developed. The validity of the method is demonstrated by comparing the results from the study of an one-story one-bay infilled frame <b>under</b> lateral <b>static</b> load in the beam level, against results derived by other investigators. 1...|$|R
