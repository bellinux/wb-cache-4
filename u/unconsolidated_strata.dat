5000|$|Investigations {{have led}} to some {{individuals}} to claim that Titterstone Clee was once an active volcano. However, this was conclusively shown to be incorrect in the 1930s when exposures clearly revealed an intrusive origin for the igneous rock which is found beneath the higher ground. Locally {{this is known as}} [...] "Dhu Stone" [...] (Welsh for Black Stone); geologically it is an olivine basalt, sometimes coarse enough to be a dolerite. It appears to have been intruded as a sill between sandstone layers within the <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>strata</b> of the Middle Westphalian soon after deposition of the latter.|$|E
50|$|Three Fingered Jack, {{named for}} its {{distinctive}} shape, is a Pleistocene volcano in the Cascade Range of Oregon. It is a deeply glaciated shield volcano and consists mainly of basaltic andesite lava. Compared with other heavily glaciated volcanic peaks such as Mount Washington and Mount Thielsen, which display eroded volcanic necks as their cores, Three Fingered Jack's present summit is a narrow ridge of loose tephra supported by a dike only 10 ft thick on a generally north - south axis. Radiating dikes and plugs {{from a series of}} overlapping cinder and composite cones that support this summit have been exposed by glaciation.The sole glacier is the unofficially-named Jack glacier, located in a shaded cirque on the northeast side at an unusually low altitude for the Oregon Cascades. The last cone-building eruptions were more explosive in nature than earlier shield-building eruptions, producing mostly <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>strata.</b> Cone-building eruptions ceased before the Pleistocene glacial period, allowing the expanded glacial cover to remove most of the cone.|$|E
40|$|The {{hypervelocity}} impact (1. 25 - 6 km/s) of projectiles {{into water}} overlying <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>strata</b> is reported {{for a variety}} of water depths. Variation of the background atmospheric pressure is found to be an important additional parameter. The relation of these exploratory experiments to pelagic impact of asteroidal-sized objects is discussed from the standpoint of atmospheric injection of sea water, the modification of bottom (benthic) topography, and the generation of a field of mega-amplitude sea waves and their propagation away from the source...|$|E
40|$|Coral reef {{calcareous}} sediment, {{a special}} category of rock-soil material, has representative geological structure and environmental characteristics. It is widely distributed in shallow {{areas of the}} tropical ocean; therefore the exploration instruments and technologies for engineering geology studies of coral reef calcareous sediments {{are very different from}} those used in land or deep-sea. Obtaining undisturbed cores from the Holocene <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>stratum</b> of coral reefs has been a key problem in the field of marine geology and environment surveying. The authors have designed a novel floating drilling platform equipped with a drilling machine, and successfully achieved undisturbed cores from both reef flats (with water depth 0. 5 to 2 m) and a enclosed lagoon (with water depth 2 – 12 m) of Yongshu Reef (9 ° 32 – 9 ° 42 N, 112 ° 52 – 113 ° 04 E), southern South China Sea. Based on the detailed observation on the cores and the analysis from engineering geology, Yongshu Reef was split into reef three engineering geological zones: leading edge, reef flat (including outer reef flat, middle reef flat and inner reef flat) and lagoon. The sediments are classified in the stratum as fine sand, medium sand, coarse sand, gravel and weak-cemented reef limestone...|$|R
30|$|The Chao Phraya basin {{consists}} of a mountainous upland and intermountain plain. The mountains present fractured bedrock aquifers, which consist of fractured metamorphic and igneous rocks, {{as well as local}} karstic aquifers (Koontanakulvong 2006). The downstream plain is formed by a sequence of eight Quaternary <b>unconsolidated</b> sedimentary aquifer <b>strata</b> that are separated by clayey lacustrine aquitards (Takaya 1971; Arlai 2007).|$|R
40|$|Gas hydrate {{model and}} free gas model are established, and {{two-phase}} theory (TPT) for numerical simulation of elastic wave velocity is adopted {{to investigate the}} <b>unconsolidated</b> deep-water sedimentary <b>strata</b> in Shenhu area, South China Sea. The relationships between compression wave (P wave) velocity and gas hydrate saturation, free gas saturation, and sediment porosity at site SH 2 are studied, respectively, and gas hydrate saturation of research area is estimated by gas hydrate model. In depth of 50 to 245 [*]m below seafloor (mbsf), as sediment porosity decreases, P wave velocity increases gradually; as gas hydrate saturation increases, P wave velocity increases gradually; as free gas saturation increases, P wave velocity decreases. This rule is almost consistent with the previous research result. In depth of 195 to 220 [*]mbsf, the actual measurement of P wave velocity increases significantly relative to the P wave velocity of saturated water modeling, and this layer is determined to be rich in gas hydrate. The average value of gas hydrate saturation estimated from the TPT model is 23. 2 %, and the maximum saturation is 31. 5 %, which is basically in accordance with simplified three-phase equation (STPE), effective medium theory (EMT), resistivity log (Rt), and chloride anomaly method...|$|R
40|$|The Seattle Fault is {{an active}} east-west {{trending}} reverse fault zone that intersects both Seattle and Bellevue, two highly populated cities in Washington. Rupture along strands of the fault poses {{a serious threat to}} infrastructure and thousands of people in the region. Precise locations of fault strands are still poorly constrained in Bellevue due to blind thrusting, urban development, and/or erosion. Seismic reflection and aeromagnetic surveys have shed light on structural geometries of the fault zone in bedrock. However, the fault displaces both bedrock and unconsolidated Quaternary deposits, and seismic data are poor indicators of the locations of fault strands within the <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>strata.</b> Fortunately, evidence of past fault strand ruptures may also be recorded indirectly by fluvial processes and should also be observable in the subsurface. I analyzed hillslope and river geomorphology using LiDAR data and ArcGIS to locate surface fault traces and then compare/correlate these findings to subsurface offsets identified using borehole data. Geotechnical borings were used to locate one fault offset and provide input to a cross section of the fault constructed using Rockworks software. Knickpoints, which may correlate to fault rupture, were found upstream of this newly identified fault offset as well as upstream of a previously known fault segment...|$|E

40|$|Studies of the {{hydrogeology}} of {{the southern}} Great Basin differ widely in their conclusions regarding the origin of major springs at Ash Meadows, in the Amargosa Desert, Nevada, and in the Furnace Creek- Nevares Spring area in Death Valley, California. The diversity of opinion reflects the following. First, ground water commonly moves between intermontane basins of the region via thick, highly fractured, and areally extensive Paleozoic carbonate rocks; the resulting lack of correspondence of topographic and ground-water divides precludes routine utilization of the water-budget method {{in the study of}} these basins. Second, subsurface hydraulic data for the regional carbonate aquifer are sparse and difficult to interpret because of the complex subsurface disposition of and hydraulic barriers within the aquifer. An analysis of hydrologic, geologic, geochemical, and isotopic data permits a first approximation of the subsurface watershed tributary to the cited spring groups. Water temperature, chemistry, isotope content, hydraulic head, and geologic relations indicate that the major springs at Ash Meadows and in the Furnace Creek-Nevares Spring area, though emerging from <b>unconsolidated</b> Quaternary <b>strata,</b> are fed by water moving directly from the underlying carbonate aquifer of Paleozoic age. Joint use of potentiometric, geologic, and isohyetal maps indicates that the subsurface watershed tributary to Ash Meadows is no smaller than 4, 500 square miles. The Ash Meadows ground-water basin is bordered on the south and east by the Spring Mountains and Sheep Range, the principal recharge areas, and on the west by the Belted Range, Eleana Range, and Shoshone Mountain. A northern boundary was not definable, and some underflow from White River ground-water basin, 90 miles northeast of the springs, is probable. The hydrogeologic data do not support the conclusion of earlier studies that underflow from Pahrump Valley is the major source of the spring discharge at Ash Meadows; probably {{no more than a few}} percent of the total comes from that valley. Comparison of the size, climate, and discharge from the Ash Meadows basin with that of the surface watershed tributary to the Furnace Creek-Nevares Spring area indicates that most of the spring discharge in east-central Death Valley originates well beyond its confines. Disposition of the carbonate aquifer favors the movement of ground water into Death Valley from central Amargosa Desert. Water in the carbonate aquifer in the latter area may be derived from the Ash Meadows basin, from the overlying valley fill, or both. Five hydrochemical facies were distinguished by percentage of major cations and anions in ground water from 147 sources. The hydrochemical facies reflect both the mineralogy of strata within recharge areas and downward crossflow from a Tertiary tuff aquitard into the carbonate aquifer. The areal distribution of these facies provides evidence for a northeasterly source of the Ash Meadows discharge, absence of significant underflow from Pahrump Valley to Ash Meadows, and movement of water from the central Amargosa Desert to the Furnace Creek- Nevares Spring area. The data are also compatible with southwestward underflow into the Ash Meadows basin from the White River basin. The deuterium content of 53 water samples from 27 major valleylevel springs and selected wells falls into several areally distinct patterns which suggest that 35 percent of the Ash Meadows discharge is derived from the White River basin, that underflow from Pahrump Valley is unlikely, and that water discharging in the Furnace Creek-Nevares Spring area may be related to water in the carbonate aquifer within the Ash Meadows basin. However, other interpretations are possible indicating that unequivocal interpretations about the regional flow system cannot be made from isotopic data alone...|$|R
