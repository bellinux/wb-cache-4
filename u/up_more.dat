5|$|Tulsa's primary {{employers}} {{are small and}} medium-sized businesses: there are 30 companies in Tulsa that employ more than 1,000 people locally, and small businesses make <b>up</b> <b>more</b> than 80% of the city's companies.|$|E
5|$|While {{the moment}} from {{gyroscopic}} forces is only 12% of this, it {{can play a}} significant part because it begins to act {{as soon as the}} rider applies the torque, instead of building <b>up</b> <b>more</b> slowly as the wheel out-tracks. This can be especially helpful in motorcycle racing.|$|E

5|$|According {{to a local}} atlas, Mountain Grove Campground was semicircular in shape, with avenues {{radiating}} out {{towards the}} sides. An open space for worshiping was on the camp meeting site, and it was surrounded by more tents. When this area was filled <b>up,</b> <b>more</b> people would set up tents along the avenues that radiated outward from the camp.|$|E
5|$|Affeldt {{returned}} to the Royals on July 7. Through July 27, he had a 2.18 ERA. He did not give <b>up</b> <b>more</b> than one earned run until August 5, when {{he got his first}} loss of the year against the Oakland Athletics. However, Affeldt had a 12.71 ERA in his next eighteen appearances, which raised his ERA to 6.93. He held opposing batters scoreless for the final nine games of the season to bring it down to a seasonending 5.26.|$|E
5|$|After {{the renewed}} failure, Sapountzakis was {{relieved}} of his command {{and replaced by}} Crown Prince Constantine. Constantine now proceeded to carefully marshal his forces, bringing <b>up</b> <b>more</b> men and artillery. The Crown Prince formulated a new plan, whereby his army would feign an attack on Bizani from the southeast, while the main effort would be actually directed on the fortress area's southwestern flank.|$|E

Allen, Larkin, and O'Brien are also memorialised, both in Manchester– where the Irish community made <b>up</b> <b>more</b> than 10percent of the population– and in Ireland, where they were regarded by many as inspirational heroes.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, the company opened its 1,000th Public Storage {{location}} {{and the company}} was three times larger than its nearest competitor in the US market. By 1989, $2.7 billion had been invested from 200,000 investors. Public Storage helped popularize the use of self-storage businesses as a real estate investment vehicle {{and became one of}} the longest-running RELP investment vehicles. By 1991, Public Storage had set <b>up</b> <b>more</b> than 150 RELPs and real estate investment trusts (REITs).|$|E
5|$|Coolidge, {{sensing the}} {{severity}} of circumstances were then in need of his intervention, conferred with Crane's operative, William Butler, and then acted. He called <b>up</b> <b>more</b> units of the National Guard, restored Curtis to office, and took personal control of the police force. Curtis proclaimed {{that all of the}} strikers were fired from their jobs, and Coolidge called for a new police force to be recruited.|$|E

5|$|In Mingora, the Taliban had set an edict that no {{girls could}} attend school after 15 January 2009. The group had already blown <b>up</b> <b>more</b> {{than a hundred}} girls' schools. The night before the ban took effect {{was filled with the}} noise of {{artillery}} fire, waking Yousafzai several times. The following day, Yousafzai also read for the first time excerpts from her blog that had been published in a local newspaper.|$|E
5|$|Monmouth {{learned of}} the {{approach}} of royalist reinforcements and departed, but instead of marching to London, he headed north with his force towards the county of Somerset. On 15 June he fought with the militia at Axminster, taking the town before the militias could join <b>up.</b> <b>More</b> recruits joined his disorganised force, which was now around 6,000, consisting mostly of nonconformists, artisans, and farm workers armed with farm tools (such as pitchforks). One famous supporter was the young Daniel Defoe.|$|E
5|$|Other critics emphasise {{that the}} letter's object, Lord Molesworth, was {{targeted}} to bind the higher and lower classes together. Using Molesworth, a religious dissenter, a nobleman, and {{the opposite of}} Swift, the Drapier unites all of the various people of Ireland in a common nationalist cause. Instead of defending charges against himself, the Drapier is calling <b>up</b> <b>more</b> support for the Irish cause; he seeks attention so that the greater liberty of Ireland will be respected.|$|E
25|$|Petrelis later faced {{criticism}} {{for his actions}} inside the cathedral. By standing on a pew, blowing a whistle, and screaming, while the other protesters inside the church participated in silent die-ins or read prepared statements, Petrelis had angered other protesters as well as outsiders and established his early {{reputation as one of}} ACT <b>UP's</b> <b>more</b> radical members.|$|R

5|$|Sperm whales {{increase}} {{levels of}} primary production and carbon export by depositing iron-rich faeces into surface {{waters of the}} Southern Ocean. The iron-rich faeces cause phytoplankton to grow and take <b>up</b> <b>more</b> carbon from the atmosphere. When the phytoplankton dies, it sinks to the deep ocean and takes the atmospheric carbon with it. By reducing the abundance of sperm whales in the Southern Ocean, whaling has resulted in an extra 2 million tonnes of carbon remaining in the atmosphere each year.|$|E
5|$|The fusion rate in {{the core}} is in a self-correcting equilibrium: a {{slightly}} higher rate of fusion would cause the core to heat <b>up</b> <b>more</b> and expand slightly against {{the weight of the}} outer layers, reducing the density and hence the fusion rate and correcting the perturbation; and a slightly lower rate would cause the core to cool and shrink slightly, increasing the density and increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present rate.|$|E
5|$|The mass {{distribution}} of the Neptunian moons is the most lopsided of the satellite systems of the giant planets in the Solar System. One moon, Triton, makes up {{nearly all of the}} mass of the system, with all other moons together comprising only one third of one percent. This is similar to the moon system of Saturn, where Titan makes <b>up</b> <b>more</b> than 95% of the total mass. This may be because Triton was captured well after the formation of Neptune's original satellite system, much of which would have been destroyed in the process of capture.|$|E

5|$|The {{national}} team toured the Indian subcontinent during the 195960 Australian season, opening <b>up</b> <b>more</b> vacancies at a domestic level. Booth {{had a strong}} first-class season, scoring 718 runs at 65.27 with two centuries to place third on the run scoring aggregates. He started the season with 168 as New South Wales defeated Queensland by an innings before scoring 177 two matches later in an innings win over South Australia. His state completed a seventh Sheffield Shield triumph in succession.|$|E
5|$|Yet another {{structure}} {{available is}} λ/2 open-circuit stubs {{across the line}} coupled with λ/4 impedance transformers. This topology has both low-pass and band-pass characteristics. Because it will pass DC, {{it is possible to}} transmit biasing voltages to active components without the need for blocking capacitors. Also, since short-circuit links are not required, no assembly operations other than the board printing are required when implemented as stripline. The disadvantages are (i) the filter will take <b>up</b> <b>more</b> board real estate than the corresponding λ/4 stub filter, since the stubs are all twice as long; (ii) the first spurious passband is at 2ω0, as opposed to 3ω0 for the λ/4 stub filter.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the schools}} {{do not share}} {{geographic}} proximity, which would induce frequent recruiting battles, {{there have been some}} high-profile recruits that were heavily targeted by both institutions. Chris Webber, Michigan's Mr. Basketball in 1991 and the National High School player of the year, chose Michigan over Duke and eventually became the #1 pick in the 1993 NBA Draft after playing two seasons for the Wolverines. Duke returned the favor by gaining a commitment from Michigan-raised Detroit Country Day alum Shane Battier, the 1997 Mr. Basketball of Michigan, who led Duke's 2001 National Championship team, while sweeping all of the National Player of the Year awards. Battier had been a fan of the Fab Five growing <b>up.</b> <b>More</b> recently, Michigan landed Mitch McGary, who had visited only Michigan, Duke and University of North Carolina.|$|E
