Design: One-day recall diet records from the MRC National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) (1946 Birth Cohort) at age 4 years were analysed for energy and selected nutrients and compared to the published results for 4 -year-olds in the 1992 / 93 National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS). Setting: England, Scotland and Wales in 1950 and 1992 / 93. Subjects: 4599 children in 1950 and 493 children in 1992 / 93.

40|$|THE {{realization}} {{of the importance of}} environmental factors in disease processes and the interest in comparisons of the incidence of disease in different countries have led to a debate as to the relative importance of various dietary factors in large bowel disease (Burkitt, 1971; Hill et al., 1971). In recent years there has been an awakening of interest in the role of fibre, and of <b>unavailable</b> <b>carbohydrate,</b> in intestinal disease (Burkitt, 1971; Cummings, 1973). It is difficult to obtain data on fibre intake and the problem is further complicated by questions on the definition of fibre (Cummings, 1973), the sources of fibre in the diet and the extraction rates of the flour consumed {{in various parts of the}} world. Although dietary data are not available on a large scale the Food and Agriculture Organisation (F. A. O.) publishes annually an estimate of the food available each day per person in many countries. In a recent study of these data we were unable to demonstrate any relationship between cancer of the colon and the total availability of crude fibre (Drasar and Irving, 1973). However, in view of the interest in fibre it seemed worth while to analyse the data in more detail by separating the individual fibre containing foods. The countries considered are listed in Table I. The availability of the various commodities is taken from the F. A. O. (1969) data and the incidence of colo...|$|R

40|$|Foods {{that contain}} <b>unavailable</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> may lower the risks for some non-transmissible chronic {{diseases}} {{because of the}} potential benefits provided by the products of colonic fermentation. On the other hand, foods that are sources of available carbohydrates may have higher energy value and increase the post-prandial glycemic response. The biomarker glycemic index and the resulting glycemic load may be used to classify foods according to their potential to increase blood glucose. Information about glycemic index and glycemic load may be useful in diet therapy. Currently, food composition tables in Brazil do not provide data for individually analyzed carbohydrates even though some quality data are available in scientific publications. The objectives of this work were to produce and compile information about the concentration of individual carbohydrates in foods and their glycemic responses and to disseminate this information through the Brazilian Food Composition Database (TBCA-USP). The glycemic index and glycemic load of foods were evaluated in healthy individuals. Concentrations of available carbohydrates (soluble sugars and available starch) and <b>unavailable</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> (dietary fiber, resistant starch, beta-glucans, fructans) were quantified by official methods, and other national data were compiled.

40|$|This work {{aimed to}} study the in vitro colonic {{fermentation}} profile of <b>unavailable</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> of two different kinds of unripe banana flour and to evaluate their postprandial glycemic responses. The unripe banana mass (UBM), obtained from the cooked pulp of unripe bananas (Musa acuminata, Nanico variety), and the unripe banana starch (UBS), obtained from isolated starch of unripe banana, plantain type (Musa paradisiaca) in natura, were studied. The fermentability of the flours was evaluated by different parameters, using rat inoculum, {{as well as the}} glycemic response produced after the ingestion by healthy volunteers. The flours presented high concentration of <b>unavailable</b> <b>carbohydrates,</b> which varied in the content of resistant starch, dietary fiber and indigestible fraction (IF). The in vitro colonic fermentation of the flours was high, 98 % for the UBS and 75 % for the UBM when expressed by the total amount of SCFA such as acetate, butyrate and propionate in relation to lactulose. The increase in the area under the glycemic curve after ingestion of the flours was 90 % lower for the UBS and 40 % lower for the UBM than the increase produced after bread intake. These characteristics highlight the potential of UBM and UBS as functional ingredients. However, in vivo studies are necessary in order to evaluate the possible benefic effects of the fermentation on intestinal health.

40|$|Interest in the glycemic {{impact of}} diet {{on health and}} {{well-being}} is growing among health care professionals and consumers. Diets with high glycemic impact have been postulated to increase risk of obe-sity, insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. A re-duction in the glycemic impact of the diet has been proposed {{as a means of}} assisting body weight management, improving blood glu-cose control, and reducing diabetic, cardiovascular, and related risks. Foods are increasingly carrying labels that describe their gly-cemic properties. Yet, a scientific debate exists about whether a relation between the glycemic response to diet and health truly ex-ists, and, if so, which descriptor of a food’s glycemic properties best predicts its effect on health outcomes. This article reports the pro-ceedings of a workshop at which a meta-analysis of the relation between the glycemic response to foods and health was presented and the merits of glycemic index (GI), glycemic load (GL), and glycemic glucose equivalent as predictors of health outcomes were discussed. The conclusions include the findings that many studies purporting to investigate lower GI interventions actually studied lower GL interventions; that <b>unavailable</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> (eg, dietary fiber), independent of GI, seems to have at least as big an effect on health outcome as GI itself; that lower GI and GL diets are beneficial for health in persons with impaired glucose metabolism, but that it is as yet unclear what they mean for healthy persons; and that the larger the divergence of glucose metabolism from the norm, the larger the effect of lower GI and GL interventions.

40|$|Several {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} {{to determine the effect}} of high fiber (NDF, ADF) forages on DM intake, digestibility and production using lactating cattle and steers. In vitro and in situ experiments explored the effect of inoculants, inoculant/enzyme, and various combinations of fibrolytic enzymes on DM disappearance, cell wall composition and changes in Cornell carbohydrate and protein degradation fractions. Cell walls of grasses contain high proportions of polysaccharides of low digestive value. The degradation of these cell walls by the rumen microbes is slow and incomplete especially in high fiber forages. Feed additives or processing that facilitate a faster breakdown of the forage cell walls may also increase the rumen turnover rate and the efficiency of feed utilisation through reduced grain supplementation. In the first experiment (chapter three) the feed intake and milk production potential of two napier grass varieties were evaluated. The possibility of using an all crop LAB inoculant in conserving napier grass as silage, was investigated using a late-cut barley silage crop, characterized by high ADF and NDF as a model. The preceding led to the use of a combined LAB inoculant and a fibrolytic enzyme additive on both early and late-cut barley. We also performed several experiments (chapter six and seven) whose main objective was to increase the DM solubility, reduce cell wall fractions and study the effect of enzymes on Cornell carbohydrate and protein fractions in various alfalfa hay, grass hay, barley silage, oat straw and fenugreek hay and straw. Overall the results from all the experiments showed that treating of high fiber (ADF and NDF) forages with inoculants or inoculant/enzyme products did not significantly alter their ensiling or feeding value. Animal performance (DM intake, digestibility and milk yield and composition) was not significantly improved when animals were fed inoculant or inoculant/enzyme treated forages. The use of combinations of various fibrolytic enzymes (additives) reduced the cell wall fractions ADF and NDF in both legume hay, grass hay, cereal silage and legume and cereal straws. These enzymes enhanced more DM disappearance in temperate grasses than in tropical grasses. Fibrolytic enzymes decreased the rapidly degradable protein and <b>unavailable</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> fractions but increased the rapidly degradable and the total available carbohydrate fractions. The causes of the inconsistencies in enzyme treatments on barley silage compared to alfalfa hay or other forages was elucidated by significant shifts in the Cornell carbohydrate and protein degradability fractions of treated forages. The use of fibrolytic enzymes as direct-fed additives or in ensiling forages holds the future for improving both the preservation and digestibility of both tropical and temperate high fiber forages.

40|$|In {{the present}} {{doctoral}} research, {{different aspects of}} glycemic index and glycemic load were investigated. We observed interlaboratory variability in GI measurement and studied GI and GL effects on health aspects. Firstly, {{there is evidence that}} one needs controlling and collecting analyses from different laboratory for optimizing GI methodology. The standardization is the groundwork if the aim is glycemic labelling of food products. There is, in fact, sufficient evidence to support labelling on the grounds of benefit for diabetic persons, considering also the growing incidence of diabetes in developed and developing countries. However, caution should be exercised in food choice based solely on GI or GL because LGI and GL foods may be energy dense and contain substantial amounts of sugars or undesirable fat that contribute to the diminished glycemic response but not necessarily to good health outcomes. It seems appropriate that, when GI or GL are used to guide food choice, this should only be done in the context of other nutritional indicators and when values have been measured in a large group of individuals (Livesey et al. 2008, Mitchell 2008, Howlett and Ashwell 2008). Moreover, there is evidence for a positive effect of LGI meal to i) improve glucose tolerance during a subsequent meal; ii) to increase post prandial metabolism and iii) to protect liver and, indirectly, heart health. However, not all the mechanisms of action are completely clear. The second meal effect seems more a consequence of fermentable carbohydrates than low GI. Apparently, a LGI specific effect remains to be substantiated by other investigations. The effect of GI on energy metabolism results straight, but it should be confirmed by a long-term study, since controversial results {{have been reported in the}} literature. Finally, there is a direct relation between GI and liver steatosis, in particular in subjects who already suffer of impaired glucose disposal. The results observed in this thesis are in good agreement with the International Life Sciences Institute workshop on glycemic response and health, held in Nice, France (6 – 8 December 2006) (Howlett and Ashwell 2008). In summary, LGI diets improve glycemic control especially in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes; the intake of high GI carbohydrates (from both grain and non-grain sources) in large amounts is associated with an increased risk of heart disease in overweight and obese even when fibre intake is high, but this requires further confirmation in normal-weight. GI and GL are useful parameters to be considered in the choice of foods for individuals with diabetes or impaired glucose regulation, and they may also be relevant for normoglycemic individuals with insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome; <b>unavailable</b> fermentable <b>carbohydrate,</b> independent of GI, seems to have a relevant effect on health outcome...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{pattern of}} {{substrate}} utilization with diets containing a high or a low proportion of unavailable and slowly digestible carbohydrates may constitute {{an important factor}} in the control, time course, and onset of hunger in humans. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that isoenergetic diets differing only in their content of <b>unavailable</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> would result in different time courses of total, endogenous, and exogenous carbohydrate oxidation rates. DESIGN: Two diets with either a high (H diet) or a low (L diet) content of <b>unavailable</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> were fed to 14 healthy subjects studied during two 24 -h periods in a metabolic chamber. Substrate utilization was assessed by whole-body indirect calorimetry. In a subgroup of 8 subjects, endogenous and exogenous carbohydrate oxidation were assessed by prelabeling the body glycogen stores with [(13) C]carbohydrate. Subjective feelings of hunger were estimated with use of visual analogue scales. RESULTS: Total energy expenditure and substrate oxidation did not differ significantly between the 2 diets. However, there was a significant effect of diet (P: = 0. 03) on the carbohydrate oxidation pattern: the H diet elicited a lower and delayed rise of postprandial carbohydrate oxidation and was associated with lower hunger feelings than was the L diet. The differences in hunger scores between the 2 diets were significantly associated with the differences in the pattern of carbohydrate oxidation among diets (r = - 0. 67, P: = 0. 006). Exogenous and endogenous carbohydrate oxidation were not significantly influenced by diet. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of carbohydrate utilization is involved in the modulation of hunger feelings. The greater suppression of hunger after the H diet than after the L diet may be helpful, at least over the short term, in individuals attempting to better control their food intake...|$|E
40|$|Human induced {{climate change}} and {{dependence}} on non-renewable resources {{are two of the}} most serious issues facing society today. Substitution of renewable fuels produced from biomass addresses both of these issues. In the production of biofuels, {{it is important to know}} the biochemical make-up of the biomass feedstock. A high throughput assay developed by Murphy et al., provides a faster method than traditional methods and the standard developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The purpose of this study was to explore relationships of biomass quality to process variables in the production of ethanol and to pyrolysis products. Corn stover samples from Iowa and Wisconsin with varying biomass quality were used for the study. The samples were pretreated with dilute acid liquid hot water in stainless steel reactors and sand baths at four severity levels and two solids loadings. Samples underwent enzymatic hydrolysis using Genencor 2 ̆ 7 s Accellerase 1500 and XY at three different loadings. Combined sugar yields were determined at 0 hr and 24 hr hydrolysis time. These results were correlated to biomass quality as determined by the HTP assay. The result of correlation showed that severity is the most important factor in combined sugar yield, enzyme loading the second most important factor, and solids loading is not important. In the correlation to biomass quality, this study showed no strong correlations exist. The same corn stover samples were pyrolyzed using pyrolysis gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and flame ionization detection. Twenty four compounds were found and these were correlated to biomass quality parameters. Important compounds were shown to be levoglucosan, acetaldehyde, and multiple phenols (lignin derived compounds). Important correlations were found between biologically available carbohydrates and levoglucosan and acetaldehyde, along with <b>unavailable</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> and lignin with phenols. Biologically available carbohydrates correlated negatively to levoglucosan, the primary product of pyrolyzed cellulose, and positively to acetaldehyde, a secondary product. <b>Unavailable</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> and lignin correlated with various lignin derived products, including phenol, 4 -vinylphenol, and vanillin. ...|$|E
40|$|Garlic {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} and ancient medicinal plants. Its health benefits are due to its chemical components, and among these is carbohydrate, whose characteristics have been so far little investigated. The aim of this study is to typify the various components of carbohydrate (starch, individual sugars, fructans, and total dietary fibre) in four commonly consumed “Italian local landraces”: Bianco Piacentino, Rosso di Castelliri, Rosso di Sulmona, Rosso di Proceno, which are grown in two different geographical areas—Viterbo and Alvito—under the same agronomic conditions. This study will also evaluate how genotype and the cultivation area can affect the profile of the carbohydrate components of these landrace strains. Regarding <b>unavailable</b> <b>carbohydrates,</b> all of the varieties showed appreciable contents of fructans, the most representative component, which ranged from 45. 8 to 54. 4 g/ 100 g d. w. In contrast, total dietary fibre values varied from 9. 1 to 13. 1 g/ 100 g d. w. in Rosso di Castelliri and Bianco Piacentino, respectively, which are both grown in Viterbo. As for starch, only some traces were found, while the amount of total sugars ranged between 2. 12 and 3. 27 g/ 100 g d. w., with higher levels of sucrose. Our findings could provide important information that may be adopted to enhance and promote the quality of some local Italian garlic landraces through highlighting the influence that the cultivar and the environmental conditions can have on carbohydrates components...|$|E
