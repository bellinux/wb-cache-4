50|$|Monomers {{are usually}} {{permitted}} to react for 5 to 12 hours. Polymerization {{is allowed to}} proceed to ~70% conversion before a “shortstop” agent (such as dimethyldithiocarbamate and diethyl hydroxylamine) is added to react with the remaining free radicals. Once the resultant latex has “shortstopped”, the <b>unreacted</b> <b>monomers</b> are removed through a steam in a slurry stripper. Recovery of <b>unreacted</b> <b>monomers</b> is close to 100%. After monomer recovery, latex is sent {{through a series of}} filters to remove unwanted solids and then sent to the blending tanks where it is stabilized with an antioxidant. The yielded polymer latex is coagulated using calcium nitrate, aluminium sulfate, and other coagulating agents in an aluminium tank. The coagulated substance is then washed and dried into crumb rubber.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{advantages}} put {{forward of the}} UV-cured OSTE polymers in microsystems have been their i) dry bonding capacity by reacting a polymer with thiol excess to a second polymer with allyl excess at room-temperature using only UV-light, ii) their well-defined and tunable number of surface anchors (thiols or allyls) present on the surface {{that can be used}} for direct surface modification and iii) their wide tuning range of mechanical properties from rubbery to thermoplastic-like depending only on the choice of off-stoichiometry. [...] The glass transition temperature typically varies from below room-temperature for high off-stoichiometric ratios to 75 °C for a stoichiometric blend of tetrathiol and triallyl. They are typically transparent in the visible range. A disadvantage put forward with the OSTE-polymers is the leaching out of <b>unreacted</b> <b>monomers</b> at very high off-stoichiometric ratios which may affect cells and proteins in lab-on-chips, although cell viability has been observed for cell cultures on low off-stoichiometric OSTE.|$|E

40|$|Polymer-stabilised liquid {{crystals}} are {{systems in}} which {{a small amount of}} monomer is dissolved within a liquid crystalline host, and then polymerised in situ to produce a network. The progress of the polymerisation, performed within electro-optic cells, was studied by establishing an analytical method novel to these systems. Samples were prepared by photopolymerisation of the monomer under well-defined reaction conditions; subsequent immersion in acetone caused the host and any <b>unreacted</b> <b>monomer</b> to dissolve. High performance liquid chromatography was used to separate and detect the various solutes in the resulting solutions, enabling the amount of <b>unreacted</b> <b>monomer</b> for a given set of conditions to be quantified. Longer irradiations cause a decrease in the proportion of <b>unreacted</b> <b>monomer</b> since more network is formed, while a more uniform LC director alignment (achieved by decreasing the sample thickness) or a higher level of order (achieved by decreasing the polymerisation temperature) promotes faster reactions...|$|R

50|$|Photopolymerization {{can be used}} as a {{photographic}} or printing process, because polymerization only occurs in regions which have been exposed to light. <b>Unreacted</b> <b>monomer</b> can be removed from unexposed regions, leaving a relief polymeric image.

50|$|A minor role {{is playing}} {{furthermore}} the entropy change while polymerization and the package density, as the polymer is more closely packed than the monomer. In step-growth polymerization (condensation reaction) small molecules are eliminated, {{which are also}} contributing to shrinkage when removed. At elevated temperatures also the thermal aging plays a role, where <b>unreacted</b> <b>monomer</b> can polymerize and degradation products and other small molecules are released.|$|R
5000|$|Transfer to monomer. Chain {{transfer}} to monomer may {{take place in}} which the growing polymer chain abstracts an atom from <b>unreacted</b> <b>monomer</b> existing in the reaction medium. Because, by definition, polymerization reactions only {{take place in the}} presence of monomer, chain {{transfer to}} monomer determines the theoretical maximum molecular weight that can be achieved by a given monomer. Chain transfer to monomer is especially significant in cationic addition polymerization and ring-opening polymerization.|$|R

The prepared PHEA-mPEG-C 16 -ED was washed with diethyl ether and then dried under vacuum at 30 °C. The resultant powder was dissolved in distilled water (10 mL) and dialyzed against distilled water with dialysis membrane (MWCO: 3, 500) for 3 days to remove <b>unreacted</b> <b>monomers.</b> The powder of PHEA-mPEG-C 16 -ED was obtained after lyophilization.|$|E

The mixture was heated to 145 °C and allowed to react for 16 h. Synthesis was carried out under an oxygen- and moisture-free environment. The resulting product was dissolved in DCM and then precipitated in excess cold methanol to remove <b>unreacted</b> <b>monomers</b> and TPGS. The final product was collected by filtration and dried under high vacuum at 45 °C for 48 h.|$|E
30|$|A “cleaning process” for the cores {{before the}} shell growth {{reaction}} is important. Typically, the reaction mixture was loaded {{into a glass}} vial and kept at 50 – 60  °C and into the flask, a mixture of methanol, acetone, and chloroform was added. The nanocrystal precipitated and was collected by centrifugation. The precipitate was then dissolved in {{a small amount of}} toluene, and another mixture of methanol, acetone, and chloroform was added. The same purification procedure was repeated twice, resulted in a clean QD cores. A clean surface of QDs always eliminates the excess of ligands and <b>unreacted</b> <b>monomers</b> which will suppress the crystallization defect in the following shell growth.|$|E

The polymerization {{was carried out}} in a 250 -ml four-necked flask equipped with reflux condenser, mechanical stirrer, dropping funnels, and temperature controller. Nitrogen atmosphere was maintained throughout the reaction. The flask was heated over a water bath. The remaining quantities of initiator, surfactant, buffer, and water were directly added into the reactor along with 10 % of total pre-emulsion prepared. The reactor was heated to constant temperature of 70 °C with a stirring rate of 300 rpm until slight blue color appeared. The reaction temperature was then raised to 78 - 80 °C and the remaining pre-emulsion was fed drop by drop into the flask for a period of 3.5 h. The reaction was further continued for 30 min after the addition of pre-emulsion was over. A digestive catalyst TBHP was added {{to take care of the}} <b>unreacted</b> <b>monomer</b> as it blocks the double bond present on the <b>unreacted</b> <b>monomer</b> so that it cannot lead to any further side reaction. The reaction was continued for another 10 min. The reaction temperature was then reduced to room temperature and the emulsion was filtered. All the emulsion polymers were synthesized following the aforesaid procedure under identical conditions.|$|R

30|$|A generic {{protocol}} for the automated synthesis and purification of MIP nanoparticles {{has been developed}} and described earlier [5]. The first step involves loading the monomer/initiator mixture, dissolved in a suitable solvent, onto a temperature-controlled column reactor containing the template immobilized onto a solid support. Once the temperature reaches a predetermined set point, polymerization is initiated by UV irradiation of the reactor for the desired reaction time. After polymerization is arrested, the column is washed with fresh solvent at a low temperature. At this stage, <b>unreacted</b> <b>monomers</b> and other low molecular weight materials are eluted along with low-affinity polymer nanoparticles. This leaves the desired high-affinity particles still bound to the phase with immobilized template. These are then collected by increasing the column temperature. Raising the temperature will increase the rate of exchange of the particles with the template phase, reducing {{the strength of the}} association, and assist with eluting the particles.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Our {{studies of}} {{amorphous}} calcium phosphate (ACP) -based dental materials {{are focused on}} the design of bioactive, non-degradable, biocompatible, polymeric composites derived from acrylic monomer systems and ACP by photochemical or chemically activated polymerization. Their intended uses include remineralizing bases/liners, orthodontic adhesives and/or endodontic sealers. The bioactivity of these materials originates from the propensity of ACP, once exposed to oral fluids, to release Ca and PO 4 ions (building blocks of tooth and bone mineral) in a sustained manner while spontaneously converting to thermodynamically stable apatite. As a result of ACP’s bioactivity, local Ca- and PO 4 -enriched environments are created with supersaturation conditions favorable for the regeneration of tooth mineral lost to decay or wear. Besides its applicative purpose, our research also seeks to expand the fundamental knowledge base of structure-composition-property relationships existing in these complex systems and identify the mechanisms that govern filler/polymer and composite/tooth interfacial phenomena.
