People of the Han also consumed sorghum, Job's tears, taro, mallow, mustard green, melon, bottle gourd, bamboo shoot, {{the roots of}} lotus plants, and ginger. Some of the fruits the Han ate included the chestnut, jujube, pear, peach, plum (including the plum of Prunus salicina and Prunus mume), melon, apricot, red bayberry, and strawberry. The Han Chinese domesticated and ate chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, camels, cows, sheep, pigs, and dogs. The type of game animals hunted during the Han included rabbit, sika deer, turtle dove, goose, owl, Chinese bamboo partridge, magpie, common pheasant, and cranes, while fish and turtles were taken from streams and lakes. Beer—which could be an <b>unfermented</b> malt drink with low alcohol content or a stronger brew fermented with yeast—was commonly consumed alongside meat, but virtually never consumed alongside grains such as rice. Wine was also regularly consumed.|$|E

25|$|Chaptalization is {{the process}} of adding sugar to <b>unfermented</b> grape must in order to {{increase}} the alcohol content after fermentation. The technique is named after its developer, the French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal. This process is not intended to make the wine sweeter, but rather to provide more sugar for the yeast to ferment into alcohol.|$|E
25|$|Some wine journalists {{contend that}} chaptalization allows wine makers to {{sacrifice}} quality {{in favor of}} quantity by letting vines overproduce high yields of grapes that have not fully ripened. Also, winemakers have been using technological advances, such as reverse osmosis to remove water from the <b>unfermented</b> grape juice, thereby increasing its sugar concentration, but decreasing the volume of wine produced.|$|E
25|$|The Methodist Church {{has long}} used non-alcoholic wine (grape juice) in {{the sacrament of}} Holy Communion. In 1869, an American Methodist dentist named Thomas Welch {{developed}} a method of pasteurising grape juice {{in order to produce}} an <b>unfermented</b> communion wine for his church. He later founded Welch's grape juice company. By the 1880s, this non-alcoholic wine had become commonplace in Methodist churches worldwide.|$|E
25|$|In the Seventh-day Adventist Church the Holy Communion service customarily {{is celebrated}} once per quarter. The service {{includes}} the ordinance of footwashing and the Lord's Supper. Unleavened bread and <b>unfermented</b> (non-alcoholic) grape juice is used. Open communion is practised: all {{who have committed}} their lives to the Saviour may participate. The communion service must be conducted by an ordained pastor, minister or church elder.|$|E

25|$|This is {{wine from}} one of the 13 {{wine-growing}} regions (Anbaugebiete), and the region must be shown on the label. It is a basic level of everyday, mostly inexpensive quaffing wines. The grapes are at a fairly low level of ripeness, with must weights of 51°Oe to 72°Oe. The alcohol content of the wine must be at least 7% by volume, and chaptalization (adding sugar to the <b>unfermented</b> grape juice to boost the final alcohol level, which in no way alters the sweetness) is often used. QbA range from dry to semi-sweet, and the style is often indicated on the label, along with the designation Qualitätswein and the region. Some top-level dry wines are officially QbA although they would qualify as Prädikatswein.|$|E

It was first made available in the UK in 1990.|$|E
25|$|Practices such as these, varying {{from the}} mundane to the grotesque, were {{commonly}} associated with necromancy. Rituals could be quite elaborate, involving magic circles, wands, talismans, and incantations. The necromancer might also surround himself with morbid aspects of death, which often included wearing the deceased's clothing and consuming foods that symbolized lifelessness and decay such as unleavened black bread and <b>unfermented</b> grape juice. Some necromancers {{even went so far}} as to take part in the mutilation and consumption of corpses. These ceremonies could carry on for hours, days, or even weeks, leading up to the eventual summoning of spirits. Frequently they were performed in places of interment or other melancholy venues that suited specific guidelines of the necromancer. Additionally, necromancers preferred to summon the recently departed based on the premise that their revelations were spoken more clearly. This timeframe was usually limited to the twelve months following the death of the physical body; once this period elapsed, necromancers would evoke the deceased’s ghostly spirit instead.|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the flavor}} {{characteristics}} of Grodziskie {{result from the}} chemical makeup of the water that the breweries used to produce the beer. [...] The water {{from one of the}} wells on Poznańska Street in Grodzisk was tested, and showed a sulfate ion concentration of 183 parts per million (ppm) and a chloride ion concentration of 81 ppm. [...] Alkalinity (as calcium bicarbonate) was 350 ppm and the magnesium ion concentration was 34 ppm. [...] Using this type of water to produce beer would result in a higher than expected hop flavor because of the high alkalinity and the ratio of sulfate ions to chloride ions. [...] During the early stages of production, this water would have a higher pH, which would inhibit the efficiency of the natural enzymes that convert the starch in the grain to fermentable sugars during mashing. [...] The result is a beer with more <b>unfermented</b> sugars and lower average alcohol content. [...] Finally, the water would have contributed a slightly sour or bitter flavor to the beer, due to the high concentration of magnesium ions.|$|E

2500|$|As a vin doux naturel (or VdN) Maury wines {{undergo a}} unique form of {{winemaking}} that shares elements with other notable fortified wines like Port, Sherry, Madeira and vin de liqueur. An English {{translation of the}} name would be [...] "wines naturally sweet" [...] and refers to the natural residual sugars of the grapes that are left <b>unfermented</b> in the wine. However these sugars are left because of the outside addition of grape spirits (or brandy) added early in the fermentation period that kills the yeast and halts the fermentation process. This process, called mutage leaves a partially fermented must (called the vin muté) with 6 to 12% alcohol from the fermentation and 5-10% alcohol by volume from the brandy. The amount of residual sugar left in the wine will vary from 50 to 125 g/l (5 to 12.5% RS).|$|E

To enhance a wine's sweetness, a portion of the wine must was boiled to concentrate the sugars in the process known as defrutum and then added {{to the rest of the}} fermenting batch. (Columella's writings suggest that the Romans believed boiling the must acted as a preservative as well.) Lead was also sometimes used as a sweetening agent, but honey could also be added, as much as [...] recommended to sufficiently sweeten [...] of wine to Roman tastes. Another technique was to withhold a portion of the sweeter, <b>unfermented</b> must and blend it with the finished wine, a method known today as süssreserve.|$|E

Relocating to Vineland in 1865, clergyman, inventor and dentist Thomas Bramwell Welch (1825–1903), who developed the method for pasteurizing grape juice to prevent natural fermentation and spoilage in 1869, purchased the locally grown grapes to make [...] "unfermented wine" [...] (or grape juice) that was marketed as [...] "Dr. Welch's <b>Unfermented</b> Wine" [...] and later as Welch's Grape Juice.

Gay-Lussac, in his [...] "Mémoire sur la Fermentation,"[1] alludes to Appert's method of preserving beer-wort <b>unfermented</b> for an indefinite time, by simply boiling the wort and closing the vessel in which the boiling fluid is contained, in such a way as thoroughly to exclude air; and he shows that, if a little yeast be introduced into such wort, after it has cooled, the wort at once begins to ferment, even though every precaution be taken to exclude air.

Their very furniture had mysteriously a high-browed quality, and Mr. Goopes when at home dressed simply in a pajama-shaped suit of canvas sacking tied with brown ribbons, while his wife wore a purple djibbah with a richly embroidered yoke. He was a small, dark, reserved man, with a large inflexible-looking convex forehead, and his wife was very pink and high-spirited, with one of those chins that pass insensibly into a full, strong neck. Once a week, every Saturday, they had a little gathering from nine till the small hours, just talk and perhaps reading aloud and fruitarian refreshments--chestnut sandwiches buttered with nut tose, and so forth--and lemonade and <b>unfermented</b> wine; and to one of these symposia Miss Miniver after a good deal of preliminary solicitude, conducted Ann Veronica.|$|E

He meant to go to sea, but he went first to a factory town and worked three or four years in the mills. He never went back to the farm, but he sent a little money now and then to his mother; and he stayed on till he got into trouble. He did not say just what kind of trouble, but I fancied it was some sort of love-trouble; he blamed himself for it; and when he left that town {{to get away from the}} thought of it, as much as anything, and went to work in another town, he took to drink; then, once, in a drunken spree, he found himself in New York without knowing how. But it was in what he called a sailors' boarding-house, and one morning, after he had been drinking overnight [...] "with a very pleasant gentleman," [...] he found himself in the forecastle of a ship bound for Holland, and when the mate came and cursed him up and cursed him out he found himself in the foretop. I give it partly in his own language, because I cannot help it; and I only wish I could give it wholly in his language; it was so graphic and so full of queer Yankee humor. From that time on, he said, he had followed the sea; and at sea he was always a good temperance man, but Altruria was the only place he had ever kept sober ashore. He guessed that was partly because there was nothing to drink but <b>unfermented</b> grape-juice, and partly because there was nobody to drink with; anyhow, he had not had a drop here. Everywhere else, as soon as he left his ship, he made for a sailors' boarding-house, and then he did not know much till he found himself aboard ship and bound for somewhere that he did not know of. He was always, he said, a stolen man, as much as a negro captured on the west coast of Africa and sold to a slaver; and, he said, it was a slave's life he led between drinks, whether it was a long time or short. He said he would ask his mates if it was very different with them, and when he turned to them they all shouted back, in their various kinds of foreign accents, No, it was just the same with them, every one. Then he said that was how he came to ship on our captain's vessel, and though they could not all say the same, they nodded confirmation as far as he was concerned.|$|E
