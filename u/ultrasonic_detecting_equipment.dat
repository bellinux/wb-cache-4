40|$|Sensor nodes being {{small in}} size and distributedly deployed, are {{vulnerable}} to Physical Attacks that attempt to physically destroy sensors in the sensor networks. Generally speaking, physical attacks can be classified into two types: Blind Physical Attacks and Search-based Physical Attacks. In blind attacks, sensors are destroyed using brute-force approaches (bombs/grenades etc.) that will cause significant casualties to the sensor network deployment field during sensor destruction. To preserve the deployment field, the attacker can conduct search-based attacks, by searching for sensors in the field using signal <b>detecting</b> <b>equipment</b> and destroy only the detected sensors causing less casualties to the deployment field. In this paper, we present Policy-driven Physical Attacks, where the attacker’s objectives are to destroy sensors and minimize casualties to the deployment field, by effectively combining the features of Blind Physical Attacks and Search-based Physical Attacks. In Policydriven Physical Attack, the attacker walks through the sensor network deployment field using signal <b>detecting</b> <b>equipment</b> to locate active sensors. Depending on the policy on sensor network performance degradation and field preservation, the attacker employs different sensor destruction methods. Based on detailed evaluations we observe that hybrid physical attacks are highly potent and can achieve a good balance between sensor network performance degradation and casualties to the field. We believe that our work in this paper on modeling and analyzing physical attacks {{is an important step}} in understanding their overall impacts, and effectively defending against them in the future...|$|R
