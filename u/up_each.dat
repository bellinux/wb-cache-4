5|$|Fairly {{inactive}} in nature, the Japanese sleeper ray {{spends much}} of its time lying buried on the sea floor. It can produce an electric shock of 30–80 volts to ward off predators, which include the blotchy swell shark (Cephaloscyllium umbratile). Its electric organs are composed of electrocytes, which are specialized cells derived from muscle fibers that are filled with a jelly-like substance. These electrocytes are stacked in vertical columns, with many columns making <b>up</b> <b>each</b> electric organ; this arrangement functions essentially like batteries connected in parallel. The diet of the Japanese sleeper ray includes benthic invertebrates. A parasite of this species is the tapeworm Anteropora japonica (Yamaguti, 1934) Subhapradha, 1955.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the ship's career other than that she was laid <b>up</b> <b>each</b> winter when the Gulf of Finland froze. Bronenosets was {{reclassified}} as a coast defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal on 6 July 1900, although she was not stricken until 17 August. During 1903, the ship was converted into a coal barge by the removal of her turret, her side armor, and its wooden backing, and by the division of her hull into three holds. She was redesignated as Barzha No. 34, Barzha No. 51 and, in 1914, Barzha No. 324. The ship sank in a storm in the Gulf of Finland sometime during World War I.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the ship's career other than that she was laid <b>up</b> <b>each</b> winter when the Gulf of Finland froze. On 18 July 1875, she was accidentally rammed by the ironclad , but only {{suffered}} minor damage. Perun was reclassified as a coast defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal on 6 July 1900, although she was not stricken until 17 August. After she was stricken she was used as a pilot ship before being renamed Lotsiia (Pilot) in 1915. During the 1921 Kronstadt rebellion, the ship was struck by artillery fire. She was laid up after the resulting fire badly damaged her. During a flood on 23 September 1924, Lotsiia ran aground and was subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the ship's career other than that she was laid <b>up</b> <b>each</b> winter when the Gulf of Finland froze.

Tifon was converted into a mine storage hulk in 1909 and renamed Blokshiv No. 3 on 27 October of that year. She was abandoned by the Soviets in Helsingfors (Helsinki) when they were forced to withdraw from Finland in April 1918 according to the terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, but she was later returned by the Finns in 1922. The ship was subsequently broken up in Finland.|$|E

5|$|The 2015 Vuelta a España {{included}} four principal classifications. The {{first of}} these was the general classification, which was calculated by adding <b>up</b> <b>each</b> rider's times on each stage and applying the relevant time bonuses. These were 10 seconds for the stage winner, 6 seconds for the rider in second, and 4 seconds for the rider in third, and 3, 2 and 1 seconds {{for the first three}} riders at each intermediate sprint; no bonuses were awarded on the time trial stages. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Vuelta. The rider leading the classification wore a red jersey.|$|E

By telling the story visually and deploying dialogue sparely, Carnivàle is a demanding show {{with a lot of}} subtext, and similar to reading chapters of a book, viewers need to watch episodes of Carnivàle in the right order or risk being spoiled with too little or too much story information. Many reviewers found the story too slow and confusing, but praised the show for its cinematography and realistic portrayal of the 1930s. Carnivàle received much award recognition in mostly technical categories, including fifteen Emmy nominations with five wins.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural Giro used a points {{system to}} {{determine}} the race winner. The organizers chose to have a points system over a system based around elapsed time after the scandal that engulfed the 1904 Tour de France. Another factor in the organizer's decision {{was that it would}} be cheaper to count the placings of the riders rather than clocking their times during each stage. The race leader was determined by adding <b>up</b> <b>each</b> rider's placing in each stage. Thus if a rider placed second in the first stage and third in the second stage he would have a total of five points, and whoever had the lowest points total was the leader. Under this system Luigi Ganna was declared the winner, but had the Giro been a time-based event he would have lost to the third-place finisher Giovanni Rossignoli by 37 minutes.|$|E

5|$|The race {{included}} three individual classifications {{and a team}} classification. The {{most important of these}} was the general classification. This was calculated by adding <b>up</b> <b>each</b> cyclist's finishing times on each stage. Bonus seconds were awarded for top-three placings in each stage (10 seconds for the first rider, 6 seconds for the second, 4 seconds for the third) and for placings in intermediate sprints (3 seconds for the first rider, 2 seconds for the second, 1 second for the third). The rider with the lowest cumulative time after taking bonus seconds into account was the leader of the classification and was awarded a blue and yellow jersey. (Blue and yellow are colours traditionally associated with Yorkshire.) The winner of the general classification was considered the winner of the race.|$|E
5|$|A {{blood vessel}} leads {{up the middle}} of the body from the stomach to a {{circular}} vessel {{at the base of the}} lophophore, and from there a single blind vessel runs <b>up</b> <b>each</b> tentacle. A pair of blood vessels near the body wall lead downward from the lophophore ring to the stomach and also to blind branches throughout the body. There is no heart, but the major vessels can contract in waves to move the blood. Phoronids do not ventilate their trunks with oxygenated water, but rely on respiration through the lophophore. The blood contains hemoglobin, which is unusual in such small animals and seems to be an adaptation to anoxic and hypoxic environments. The blood of Phoronis architecta carries twice as much oxygen as a human of the same weight. Two metanephridia filter the body fluid, returning any useful products and dumping the remaining soluble wastes through a pair of pores beside the anus.|$|E
5|$|During the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} the onscreen character from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} people, objects, and enemies. Like previous games in the series and most role-playing games, characters level <b>up</b> <b>each</b> time they earn a set number of experience points from defeating enemies; each level gained increases the character's statistics, thus improving their performance in battle. Statistic examples include hit points, the amount of damage a character can receive; magic points, which {{determine the number of}} times a character can use magical attacks; strength, the power of a character's physical attacks; and intelligence, the power of a character's magical spells. Upon encountering an enemy, the player can use a variety of weapons to attack and defeat the enemy. Despite the game being set in 2036, the weapon choices are largely medieval, including swords, axes, and spears, although handguns and a rocket-propelled grenade are available. These weapons differ in their damage output, the range of the weapon, and the speed of the attack.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the ship's career other than that she was {{assigned}} to the newly formed Artillery Training Detachment in March 1870 and she was laid <b>up</b> <b>each</b> winter when the Gulf of Finland froze. Lava was reclassified as a coast defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal on 6 July 1900, although she was not stricken until 17 August. The ship was used as a floating barracks by the Third Destroyer Division from 1902 to 1908 and was then used as an observation post during gunnery training. Lava was converted into a mine storage hulk in 1912 and renamed Blokshiv No. 1 on 14 April of that year. She was converted into a floating hospital in 1916 and may have received her old name at that time. She was abandoned by the Soviets in Helsingfors (Helsinki) when they were forced to withdraw from Finland in April 1918 according to the terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, but she was later returned by the Finns in 1922. The ship was supposedly broken up there around that time, but may have still been in existence in 1941.|$|E

She was abandoned by the Soviets in Helsingfors (Helsinki) when they were forced to withdraw from Finland in April 1918 according to the terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, but she was later returned by the Finns. The ship was redesignated as Blokshiv No. 2 on 1 January 1932 and survived World War II to be renamed BSh-2 on 16 May 1949. She was stricken on 27 June 1957 and turned over to the Kronstadt Yacht Club. Her ultimate fate is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} of Sam and Max {{were created in}} Purcell's youth; Purcell's younger brother Dave originally came up with several comics around {{the idea of a}} dog and rabbit detective duo. Dave would often leave unfinished comics around the house. Deliberately making the characters mix <b>up</b> <b>each</b> other's names, shoot at each other and mock {{the way in which they}} had been drawn, Steve, in a case of sibling rivalry, would sometimes finish the stories in parodies of their original form. This developed from Steve mocking his brother's to the creation of his own stories with the characters. In the late 1970s, Dave Purcell gave Steve the rights to the characters; he signed them over in a contract on Steve's birthday and allowed him to develop the characters in his own way. Purcell believes that his younger brother has recovered and forgiven him from their earlier years. Having kept one as a pet in his youth, Purcell has an interest in rats, which are commonly featured in his artistic work.|$|E
