The asbestosis losses in the early 1990s devastated the finances of many Names: upwards of 1,500 out of 34,000 Names (4.4 per cent) were declared bankrupt. This scared away other potential Names. In 2011 individual Names provide only 11 per cent of capacity at Lloyd's, with UK-listed and other corporate members providing 30 per cent and the remainder via the international insurance industry. No new Names with <b>unlimited</b> <b>liability</b> are admitted, {{and the importance of}} individual Names will continue to decline as they slowly withdraw, convert (generally into limited liability partnerships), or die.

25|$|The VOC had {{two types}} of shareholders: the participanten, who {{could be seen as}} non-{{managing}} members, and the 76 bewindhebbers (later reduced to 60) who acted as managing directors.

The innovation {{in the case of the}} VOC was that the liability of not just the participanten but also of the bewindhebbers was limited to the paid-in capital (usually, bewindhebbers had <b>unlimited</b> <b>liability).</b> The VOC therefore was a limited liability company. Also, the capital would be permanent during the lifetime of the company. As a consequence, investors that wished to liquidate their interest in the interim could only do this by selling their share to others on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we revise the results about the {{efficiency}} of (strict) <b>unlimited,</b> then limited <b>liability</b> in inducing optimal investment in prevention by injurers. Risk and ambiguity are considered. We assume that the potential injurer whose activities cause a risk of environmental accident can reduce the probability of accident by investing in prevention. In the risky model, we recover that limited liability does not always induce low prevention. Contrary to the arguments enhanced by Beard (1990) and Lipowski-Posey (1993), outside lending, absent from our model, does not explain this result. In the ambiguous context, we implement the Non-Extreme Outcome (NEO) expected utility model (Chateauneuf et al., 2007) to represent the injurer’s beliefs and decisions. When ambiguity matters and prevention also affects the injurer’s subjective beliefs, none of the results with risk hold. In particular, the injurer can overinvest in prevention under both <b>unlimited</b> and limited <b>liability.</b> Strict liability; Ambiguity; Optimal Care; Optimism; Subjective Beliefs...|$|R
40|$|The {{contemporary}} {{industrial metabolism}} is not sustainable. Critical problems arise {{at both the}} input and the output side of the complex: Although affordable fossil fuels and mineral resources are declining, the waste products of the current production and consumption schemes (especially CO 2 emissions, particulate air pollution, and radioactive residual) cause increasing environmental and social costs. Most challenges {{are associated with the}} incumbent energy economy that is unlikely to subsist. However, the crucial question is whether a swift transition to its sustainable alternative, based on renewable sources, can be achieved. The answer requires a deep analysis of the structural conditions responsible for the rigidity of the fossil-nuclear energy system. We argue that the resilience of the fossil-nuclear energy system results mainly from a dynamic lock-in pattern known in operations research as the "Success to the Successful" mode. The present way of generating, distributing, and consuming energy-the largest business on Earth-expands through a combination of factors such as the longevity of pertinent infrastructure, the information technology revolution, the growth of the global population, and even the recent financial crises: Renewable-energy industries evidently suffer more than the conventional-energy industries under recession conditions. Our study tries to elucidate the archetypical traits of the lock-in pattern and to assess the respective importance of the factors involved. In particular, we identify modern corporate law as a crucial system element that thus far has been largely ignored. Our analysis indicates that the rigidity of the existing energy economy would be reduced considerably by the assignment of <b>unlimited</b> <b>liabilities</b> to the shareholders...|$|R
25|$|Hedge fund legal {{structures}} {{vary depending}} on location and the investor(s). US hedge funds aimed at US-based, taxable investors are generally structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Limited partnerships and other flow-through taxation structures assure that investors in hedge funds {{are not subject to}} both entity-level and personal-level taxation. A hedge fund structured as a limited partnership must have a general partner. The general partner may be an individual or a corporation. The general partner serves as the manager of the limited partnership, and has <b>unlimited</b> <b>liability.</b> The limited partners serve as the fund's investors, and have no responsibility for management or investment decisions. Their liability is limited to the amount of money they invest for partnership interests. As an alternative to a limited partnership arrangement, U.S. domestic hedge funds may be structured as limited liability companies, with members acting as corporate shareholders and enjoying protection from individual liability.|$|E

50|$|In the loosest {{sense of}} group ownership, {{a lack of}} legal framework, rules and {{regulations}} may mean that group ownership of property places every member {{in a position of}} responsibility (liability) for the actions of each other member. A structured group duly constituted as an entity under law may still not protect members from being personally liable for each other's actions. Court decisions against the entity itself may give rise to <b>unlimited</b> personal <b>liability</b> for each and every member. An example of this situation is a professional partnership (e.g. law practice) in some jurisdictions. Thus, being a partner or owner in a group may give little advantage in terms of share ownership while producing a lot of risk to the partner, owner or participant.|$|R
40|$|When <b>unlimited</b> tax <b>liability</b> exists, the {{individual}} is liable for all income, both which originates from other countries {{as well as from}} Sweden. In order for <b>unlimited</b> tax <b>liability</b> to exist {{the individual}} needs to either be considered a resident in Sweden, have habitual abode here or if previous residence existed, that the essential linkage still consists. To determine whether an essential linkage exists, the factors set out in the third chapter 7 § IL shall be considered, an overall assessment of all relevant circumstances must be made. In case law however, it appears that three of the factors have been given greater importance, one of which is the factor residence for year-around use, which includes both residence for permanent use and residence used for recreational purposes. The question raised in this thesis is whether the factor residence for year-round use is still regarded as a sufficiently strong basis to independently induce essential linkage for the taxpayer. A big difference between the two housing types exists. Ownership of residence for recreational purposes is not regarded as a sufficiently strong connection that mere possession causes essential linkage. The fact that Swedish citizens retain their permanent residence after migration has been, and still is considered to constitute an essential linkage, on it´s own. The situation is uncertain regarding foreign citizens who have been living in Sweden and are considering keeping their previous permanent residence here. The foreign citizenship seems to be a factor that speaks against the presence of essential linkage and it has been accorded great weight by the courts. Generally speaking the courts seems to judge the Swedish citizens’ possession of a previous permanent residence more harshly that they do the foreign citizens. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} Chinese Shanxi piaohao, {{arguably the most}} important Chinese indigenous financial institutions in the nineteenth century, which emerged in one particular province. Concentrating on their governance structure, business strategy, and historical development, my thesis explores the emergence, growth and decline of the piaohao, and asks how they solved the commitment problem and developed their business by means of modern economists’ tools, such as path dependency and the principal agent model. This study uses a wealth of microeconomic data, which, although published, had not been digitized and properly analysed before. My work reveals that {{the emergence of the}} Shanxi piaohao shows reactive sequence path dependence. In a situation which gave little protection to shareholders’ capital, it imposed a highly centralized management structure, and a tenure- and performancebased incentive structure to discipline distant employees. Moreover, through establishing a widespread branch network, providing services {{to a wide range of}} clients, inventing various types of draft, and pricing remittance fees on diverse factors, the Shanxi piaohao were soon successful and controlled the Chinese remittance market for many decades. However, as it expanded and as China’s social and business environment became more unpredictable, the piaohao’s head managers reached the limits of their competence and its centralized management structure began to show diminishing returns. High financial leverage and a narrowed profits margin also indicated the hidden risks to the piaohao. When the 1911 Revolution broke out and ended China’s last feudal dynasty, many piaohao branches encountered immense losses from looting, bad loans and deposit withdrawals. It was during this time that modern Chinese banks and foreign banks penetrated the Chinese remittance market and poached the piaohao’s staff. Because the piaohao shareholders shared <b>unlimited</b> <b>liabilities,</b> when these threats materialized, many of them went bankrupt, while others turned to investments elsewhere and abandoned the piaohao...|$|R

40|$|When {{discussing}} {{mergers and}} acquisitions, {{most of the}} focus is given to whether {{the board of directors}} of the target company has a right of “self-defense” to stay independent. However, this thesis focuses on the other side of the transaction and seeks to determine whether the bidder in making a tender offer is acting unlawfully. Since a director has <b>unlimited</b> personal <b>liability</b> for a breach of his or her fiduciary duties, the question of whether a takeover-bid can be a breach of a director’s fiduciary duty is of great importance, yet little literature and no case law are devoted to the subject. The author addresses this issue by differentiating the duties of target-directors and bidder-directors during a takeover and by seeking to formulate a set of rules for bidder-directors to follow when making a tender offer. In developing these rules for bidder-directors, the business judgment rule and Smith v. Van Gorkom are considered...|$|R
