40|$|Empirical {{studies of}} general {{aviation}} (GA) pilot performance are lacking, especially {{with respect to}} envisioned future requirements. Two research studies were conducted to evaluate human performance using new technologies. In the first study, ten participants completed the Modified Rhyme Test (MRT) {{in an effort to}} compare the intelligibility of two text-to-speech (TTS) engines (DECtalk and AT&T’s Natural Voices) as presented in 85 dB(A) aircraft cockpit engine noise. Results indicated significant differences in intelligibility (p ≤ 0. 05) between the two speech synthesizers across the tested speech-to-noise ratios (S/N) (i. e., – 5 dB,- 8 dB, and – 11 dB S/N) with the AT&T engine resulting in superior intelligibility in all of the S/N. The AT&T product was therefore selected as the TTS engine for the second study. In the second study, 16 visual flight rules (VFR) rated pilots were evaluated for their data link performance using a flight simulator (ELITE i-GATE) equipped with a mixed-modality simulated data link within one of two flight conditions. Data link modalities included textual, synthesized speech, digitized speech, and synthesized speech/textual combination. Flight conditions included VFR (<b>unlimited</b> <b>ceiling...</b>|$|E

5000|$|United Airlines Trip 4 was a Boeing 247D {{operating}} on a scheduled flight from Salt Lake City, Utah, to Cheyenne, Wyoming, on October 7, 1935. The aircraft last contacted Cheyenne at 2:16 or 2:17 a.m. reporting its position as Silver Crown. Cheyenne called the flight at 2:17, receiving no reply.

50|$|In fighter mode the VF-1's {{thermonuclear}} {{engines and}} the several vernier rockets on its fuselage make it capable of operating as an aerospace fighter. It can reach a maximum speed of Mach 3.87 at high altitude (above 30,000 m), and Mach 2.71 at medium altitude (10,000 m). Its wings, {{similar to those}} of the F-14 Tomcat, sweep between 20 degrees back and 72 degrees back. Unlike the F-14, the wings can sweep 90 degrees back for storage, with the tail module folding up over the fighter's back. Although the VF-1 technically has an <b>unlimited</b> service <b>ceiling</b> and atmospheric range (since it can operate in space), the VF-1's internal tanks cannot carry enough propellant to achieve a stable orbit and needs the help of a booster pack to reach Low Earth Orbit.|$|R

The weather was fine and the <b>ceiling</b> <b>unlimited</b> with low broken clouds and a bright moon. Eyewitnesses on the ground observed that the airplane had not gained enough altitude as it approached the mountain ranges in Balamban. At 01:17:00 AM, the plane radioed the official presidential home, Malacañang, to have the President fetched at Nichols Field at around 03:15 AM. This communication was the last ever conveyed by the plane.|$|R
