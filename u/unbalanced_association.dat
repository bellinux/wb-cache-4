When the rectennas are associated in series, their output voltages are added, and the electrical dc energy is more easily exploitable. This letter shows {{that if a}} rectenna receives significantly less energy than the others (i. e., <b>unbalanced</b> <b>association),</b> its voltage polarity may reverse. Simulation and experimental results show that when an <b>unbalanced</b> <b>association</b> is operated at maximum power point, voltage reversal {{can result in a}} total decrease in efficiency of up to 26 %. Possible solutions to reduce these detrimental consequences are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} PDP model of binary choice verbal analogy {{problems}} (A:B as C:[D 1 |D 2], where D 1 and D 2 represent choice alternatives). We train a recurrent neural network in item-relation- item triples and use this network to test performance on analogy questions. Without training on analogy problems per se, the model explains the developmental shift from associative to relational responding as an emergent consequence of learning upon the environmentâ€™s statistics. Such learning allows gradual, item-specific acquisition of relational knowledge {{to overcome the}} influence of <b>unbalanced</b> <b>association</b> frequency, accounting for association effects of analogical reasoning seen in cognitive development. The network also captures the overall degradation in performance after anterior temporal damage by deleting a fraction of learned connections, while capturing the return of associative dominance after frontal damage by treating frontal structures as necessary for maintaining activation of A and B while seeking a relation between C and D. While our theory is still far from being complete it provides a unified explanation of findings {{that need to be}} considered together in any integrated account of analogical reasoning...|$|E
40|$|Caching {{of popular}} content on {{wireless}} nodes is recently proposed {{as a means}} to reduce congestion in the backbone of cellular networks and to improve Quality of Service. From a network point of view, the goal is to offload as many users as possible from the backbone network to the wireless caches {{while at the same time}} offering good service to cache-unrelated users. Aggressive offloading can lead to an <b>unbalanced</b> user <b>association.</b> Some wireless nodes can be overloaded by cache-related traffic while the resources of others remain underused. Given a fixed content placement, this work proposes an efficient distributed algorithm to control and balance the association of cache-related traffic among cellular cache memories. The algorithm allows the network to achieve the globally optimal solution and can be executed on base stations using a limited amount of information exchange between them. It is based on a novel algorithm we call Bucket-filling. The solution limits the cache-users per node by balancing the total load among the nodes in a fair way. The improvement compared to common user assignment policies is highlighted for single- as well as for multi-tier random networks. Comment: 6 pages, double column, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|T-Cell antigen Receptor (TR) {{repertoire}} {{is generated}} through rearrangements of V and J genes encoding a and b chains. The quantification and frequency for every V-J combination during ontogeny {{and development of}} the immune system remain to be precisely established. We have addressed this issue by building a model able to account for Va-Ja gene rearrangements during thymus development of mice. So we developed a numerical model on the whole TRA/TRD locus, based on experimental data, to estimate how Va and Ja genes become accessible to rearrangements. The progressive opening of the locus to V-J gene recombinations is modeled through windows of accessibility of different sizes and with different speeds of progression. Furthermore, the possibility of successive secondary V-J rearrangements was included in the modelling. The model points out some <b>unbalanced</b> V-J <b>associations</b> resulting from a preferential access to gene rearrangements and from a non-uniform partition of the accessibility of the J genes, depending on their location in the locus. The model shows that 3 to 4 successive rearrangements are sufficient to explain the use of all the V and J genes of the locus. Finally, the model provides information on both the kinetics of rearrangements and frequencies of each V-J associations. The model accounts for the essential features of the observed rearrangements on the TRA/TRD locus and ma...|$|R
