A funnel-shaped mouthpiece directed the voice sounds upon the membrane, and as it vibrated, the soft iron [...] "armature" [...] induced corresponding currents in the coils of the electromagnet. These currents, after traversing the wire, passed through the receiver which consisted of an electromagnet in a tubular metal can having one end partially closed by a thin circular disc of soft iron. When the <b>undulatory</b> <b>current</b> passed through the coil of this electromagnet, the disc vibrated, thereby creating sound waves in the air.|$|E

25|$|This {{primitive}} telephone {{was rapidly}} improved. The double electromagnet {{was replaced by}} a single permanently magnetized bar magnet having a small coil or bobbin of fine wire surrounding one pole, in front of which a thin disc of iron was fixed in a circular mouthpiece. The disc served as a combined diaphragm and armature. On speaking into the mouthpiece, the iron diaphragm vibrated with the voice in the magnetic field of the bar-magnet pole, and thereby caused <b>undulatory</b> <b>currents</b> in the coil. These currents, after traveling through the wire to the distant receiver, were received in an identical apparatus. This design was patented by Bell on January 30, 1877. The sounds were weak and could only be heard when the ear was close to the earphone/mouthpiece, but they were distinct.|$|R

Tomas Farley also writes that, [...] "Nearly every scholar agrees that Bell and Watson were the first to transmit intelligible speech by electrical means. Others transmitted a sound or a click or a buzz but our boys and Watson were the first to transmit speech one could understand." ...|$|R

In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was granted a patent for the electromagnetic transmission of vocal sound by <b>undulatory</b> electric <b>current.</b> Despite this, the Italian government honors him with the title [...] "Inventore ufficiale del telefono" [...] or [...] "Official inventor of the telephone". In 2002 U.S. Congress recognized an impoverished Florentine immigrant as the inventor of the telephone rather than Alexander Graham Bell.|$|R
