40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an {{analysis}} of the impact the Unemployment-Vacancy (<b>UV)</b> <b>curve</b> (or Beveridge curve) had on economic theory and to provide an account of the subsequent radical changes in its place and role over the decades since its first appearance in 1958. The paper traces the historical development of the <b>UV</b> <b>curve</b> and argues that the role of the <b>UV</b> <b>curve</b> has changed from that of a measuring device, to a graphical representation of full employment, to an axiom necessary for matching models of unemployment to a diagnostic tool. This changing role is best understood in the light of the paradigmatic change from Keynesianism to neoclassical search theory. <b>UV</b> <b>curve,</b> Beveridge curve, UV analysis, structural relations, matching function, search theory, full employment, labour economics,...|$|E
40|$|Unemployment {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} problems of the Spanish and European economies. A possible analysis, vastly extended in recent literature, focuses on mismatch problems between labour demand and supply. In this sense, the empirical relationship between the vacancy rate and the unemployment rate, the so-called Beveridge curve or <b>UV</b> <b>curve,</b> offers an instrument to characterise the unemployment of the considered economy. Different studies, such as Jackman et al. (1983) and Pissarides (1985) among others, point out that outward shifts of the Beveridge curve can be interpreted as increases in structural unemployment. The identification of these shifts provide some useful information that can be used for policy-making. The main objective of this paper is to identify the outward shifts of the Beveridge curve for the Spanish economy in the period 1978 - 96 using annual data from the Encuesta de Poblacion Activa (INE) and the Estadistica de Empleo, INEM. As both sources provide regional disaggregated data, it is possible to use a regional panel data to analyse a wide pool of factors that can explain the outward shift of the <b>UV</b> <b>curve,</b> a possible change in the elasticity of the unemployment rate with respect to the vacancy rate and the existence of different regional behaviours in the process of job-matching. <b>uv</b> <b>curve,</b> vacancy rate, structural unemployment, mismatch...|$|E

Its X-ray modulation has a double-peak structure with a dip in between. The observed X-rays are non-thermal dominant which can be modeled by a power-law with a photon index of ~ 1. 2. Intrabinary shock can be {{the origin of the}} observed X-rays. The <b>UV</b> light <b>curve</b> is resulted from the ellipsoidal modulation of the companion. Modeling the <b>UV</b> light <b>curve</b> prefers a large viewing angle. The heating effect of the <b>UV</b> light <b>curve</b> is found to be negligible which suggests the high energy radiation beam of PSR J 2129 - 0429 does not direct toward its companion.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the variability of absolute UV extinction, A lambda derived through the ratio total-to-selective extinction, R Av/E(B-V), for 31 lines of sight for which UV extinction parameters were derived, is presented. For these data, which sample {{a wide range of}} environments and which are characterized by R = 2. 5 to 6. 0, differences in the shapes of <b>UV</b> extinction <b>curves</b> are largely due to variations in optical/near-UV extinction through changes in R. From this, it is found that <b>UV</b> extinction <b>curves</b> can be reproduced with reasonable accuracy by simply knowing R.

An analytic expression is given for an improved estimate for the UV extinction law that can be obtained from optically determined values of R. For R values outside the range R = 3. 1 - 3. 5, use of the analytic expressions given here will result in a more accurate representation of the applicable UV extinction than using the standard techniques of assuming the average curve or 'ironing out' the bump...|$|E

To examine the influences that affect their development, I used the theoretical framework of <b>UV</b> <b>curve.</b> Most its theoretical assumptions are confirmed. During the period from 1996 to 2013 in the Czech Republic there is a strong correlation between related index of monthly rate job vacancies and unemployment. Likewise, both variables show statistically significant dependence on the development of pure domestic product. Contrary to theories, models failed to show any correlation between the variables and the index of average wages for the selected period. Analysis of the shape of the curve itself also showed that the unemployment trend in the Czech Republic showed a growing trend that is likely to increase due to structural unemployment...|$|E
40|$|The post-war {{debate on}} full {{employment}} policy was blurred and unclear since {{the concept of}} full employment itself was theoretically unclear and un-operational. Unable to theoretically determine the unemployment level of full employment, economists tried to find more empirically based ways to determine the level of full employment. This paper argues that economists turned the <b>UV</b> <b>curve</b> (or Beveridge curve) and Phillips curve into practical, empirical tools of investigation and measurement for full employment. In this role economists could establish quantitative facts of unemployment that were not derivable from theory alone and so fulfilled {{the role of a}} measuring instrument in economics. Consequently, they not only enhanced theory but gave specific, quantitative and empirically based interpretations of full employment that economic theory couldn’t deliver. This paper shows how the UV and Phillips curves became tools for disentangling complex and theoretically underdetermined phenomena and measurement devices for the performance of the labour market...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. RW Hydrae is an eclipsing {{detached}} {{binary star}} system, {{consisting of a}} mass losing M-giant and a hot white dwarf on circular orbits. We analyze UV observations of RW Hydrae. Approximately at φ = 0. 78, clearly unrelated to the primary eclipse, we detect in the <b>UV</b> light <b>curve</b> an event with significantly reduced UV flux. The spectral characteristics of this event indicate Rayleigh scattering due to a high column density of neutral hydrogen {{in the line of}} sight to the hot white dwarf. We model this observation in the framework of an accretion wake trailing the white dwarf. This interpretation is analogous to comparable models for ζ Aur systems and X-ray binaries.

40|$|This article {{attempts}} {{to examine the}} increase of unemployment in Japan {{from the perspective of}} what we term “the employment mismatch”. Using <b>UV</b> <b>curve</b> analysis, which is derived from a combination of the unemployment rate and the job vacancy rate, our research demonstrates a steady and significant increase in the employment mismatch in the Japanese labour market dating to the late 1990 ’s. We further attribute a substantial measure of the stagnation of labour productivity in Japan along with the associated increases in labour expense to this problem.   As a logical consequence of this severe and growing phenomenon, we expect Japan to encounter serious additional pressures with respect to the creation of new jobs. The regulative reforms since 1997 led to a change in the structure of Japanese labour market. The current mismatch and the increase in temporary work opportunities could be interpreted as a result of corporate efforts to increase personnel flexibility. A national policy recommendation is that an efficient labour market is indispensable to workers and firms {{to take full advantage of}} the wider variety of employment styles provided. </p...|$|E
40|$|A new {{construction}} of BPS monodromies for 4 d N= 2 theories of class S is introduced. A novel {{feature of this}} construction is its manifest invariance under Kontsevich-Soibelman wall crossing, {{in the sense that}} no information on the 4 d BPS spectrum is employed. The BPS monodromy is encoded by topological data of a finite graph, embedded into the <b>UV</b> <b>curve</b> C of the theory. The graph arises from a degenerate limit of spectral networks, constructed at maximal intersections of walls of marginal stability in the Coulomb branch of the gauge theory. The topology of the graph, together with a notion of framing, encode equations that determine the monodromy. We develop an algorithmic technique for solving the equations, and compute the monodromy in several examples. The graph manifestly encodes the symmetries of the monodromy, providing some support for conjectural relations to specializations of the superconformal index. For A_ 1 -type theories, the graphs encoding the monodromy are "dessins d'enfants" on C, the corresponding Strebel differentials coincide with the quadratic differentials that characterize the Seiberg-Witten curve.

40|$|Class-S {{theories}} are four-dimensional N= 2 supersymmetric field theories {{constructed by the}} reduction of a (2, 0) six-dimensional theory on a punctured Riemann surface C (called the <b>UV</b> <b>curve).</b> A basic degeneration limit of the surface C is when several punctures are brought close to each other. As this happens, a long tube appears in C and a weakly coupled gauge group emerges. When the corresponding gauge coupling is turned off, {{we are left with}} two surfaces. This decoupling leads to a unique result. We explain how to fix the gauge group that becomes weakly coupled and the resulting two theories, in terms of the types of punctures on the surface C. Each of the resulting theories is given in terms of a class-S theory (plus possibly additional free hypermultiplets). Many other more complicated degeneration limits can be described by repeatedly using this specification. For questions about weak coupling limits in such theories, it is useful to consider the set of punctures that can appear {{at the end of a}} tube. These are the punctures that are created in the resulting surfaces when the gauge coupling is taken to be extremely weak. Not any puncture can be formed in a decoupling process, and this set is described. Each such puncture can be found diagrammatically in terms of the other punctures on C in a particular decoupling limit. The relation of the gauge group to the symmetry associated with this puncture is discussed. We discuss the relation of such degeneration limits of large N theories, through the AdS/CFT correspondence, to decoupled field theories on AdS_ 5.

To this end we derive the transfer function in wavelength and time lag, for reprocessing hard (X-ray) photons from a point source to softer ones (UV-optical) by an infinite plane (representing a cool, thin accretion disk) located at a given distance below the X-ray source, {{under the assumption that}} the X-ray flux is absorbed and emitted locally by the disk as a black body of temperature appropriate to the incident flux. Using the observed X-ray light curve as input we have computed the expected continuum UV emission as a function of time at several wavelengths (łł 1315 Å, łł 6962 Å, łł 15000 Å, łł 30000 Å) assuming that the X-ray source is located one radius above the disk plane, with the mass of the black hole M and the latitude angle θ of the observer relative to the disk plane as free parameters. We have searched the parameter space of black hole masses and observer azimuthal angles but we were unable to reproduce <b>UV</b> light <b>curves</b> which would resemble, even remotely, those observed.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the protonation of acetohydroxamic acid is investigated comparing experimental results and ab initio calculations. Experimentally, the <b>UV</b> spectral <b>curves</b> were recorded at different temperatures, at constant dioxane/water concentration, and at very high concentrations of strong mineral acids. The process is followed by monitoring {{the changes in the}} <b>UV</b> <b>curves</b> with increasing acid concentration. The molecular structures and the solvation energies were calculated with the RHF, B 3 LYP, and MP 2 methods. The solvent is treated as a continuum of uniform dielectric constant. The isolated molecule of acetohydroxamic acid exhibits two protonation sites, the carbonyl oxygen and the nitrogen atom. In dioxane/water mixture, the RHF calculations predict the existence of a third cation of low stability, where the proton is bonded to the OH oxygen. With the MP 2 ab initio calculations, the free energies of the formation processes in solution of the two most stable cations, CH 3 COH-NHOH+ (O 3 H +) and CH 3 CO-NH 2 OH+ have been evaluated to be - 160. 2 kcal mol- 1 and - 157. 6 kcal mol- 1. The carbonyl site is the most active center in solution and in the gas phase. The carbonyl site is also the most active center in the UV measurements. Experimentally, the ionization constant was found to be pKO 3 H+ = - 2. 21 at 298. 15 K, after the elimination of the medium effects using the Cox-Yates equation for hight acidity levels.

40|$|Recent {{models of}} {{interstellar}} extinction {{have shown the}} importance of understanding both the UV and IR properties of interstellar dust grains. IRAS data have shown variations in 60 and 100 micron emissions presumably due {{to the presence of}} IR cirrus, while recent observations in the UV by Fitzpatrick and Massa have identified components in the <b>UV</b> extinction <b>curve</b> which vary in different star regions. A Draine and Anderson model connects these results by proposing that different size variations in interstellar grains would cause distinct changes in both the IR emission and the UV extinction. In order to test this model it is necessary to make observations in well defined locations away from peculiar extinction regions. In the infrared this means looking away from the galactic plane so as to limit non-local sources of IR radiation. Two open clusters that are out of the galactic plane and which contain a number of late B and early A stars suitable for UV extinction studies, and whose IRAS data show variations in the 60 / 100 micron ratio were studied.
