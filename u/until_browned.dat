50|$|Another variety, the Hardangerlefse (from Hardanger in Norway), is {{made from}} yeast-risen Graham flour or a fine ground whole wheat flour (krotekake). The dough is rolled with a {{conventional}} rolling pin (and much more flour) until it is thin and does not stick to the surface. It is then cut with a grooved rolling pin in perpendicular directions, cutting a grid into the dough which prevents it from creating air pockets as it cooks. The grid cut can also aid in thinner rolling of the lefse, as the ridges help preserve structural integrity. The lefse is cooked at high temperature (400 °F or 205 °C) <b>until</b> <b>browned,</b> and then left to dry. It can also be freeze dried by repeatedly freezing and thawing.|$|E
