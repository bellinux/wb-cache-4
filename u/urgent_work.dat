5|$|In 1859 Francis D'Arcy-Osborne, the Duke of Leeds, died, leaving Conisbrough to his nephew, Sackville Lane-Fox, the Baron Conyers. The keep {{remained}} in good condition, but by 1884 {{it was apparent}} that repairs were needed and the antiquarian George Clark recommended <b>urgent</b> <b>work</b> to repair the stonework. If finances allowed it, he also urged the reinstallation of a roof and wooden floors. Limited repairs were subsequently approved by the trustees of Lord Conyers, although Clark's colleague, A. Ellis, expressed concerns that railings to protect the visitors who routinely {{climbed to the top of}} the keep had not been funded. A reported £500 was spent by the trustees renovating the castle ruins, including the construction of a lodge in the outer bailey for the castle keeper, completed in 1885, and improvements to the footpaths.|$|E
25|$|By 1805, {{the north}} {{transept}} was in ruins {{and the south}} transept was in a poor condition; <b>urgent</b> <b>work</b> was carried out to the nave roof, held up by scaffolding.|$|E
25|$|The South African cricket team toured New Zealand during February 2017 to March 2017 to play three Test matches, five One Day Internationals (ODIs) and one Twenty20 International (T20I) match. In January 2017 {{the current}} South African Test captain AB de Villiers {{said he would}} be {{unavailable}} for selection for this series. The fourth ODI, which was originally scheduled to be played at McLean Park, Napier, was moved to Seddon Park, Hamilton. This was due to need for <b>urgent</b> <b>work</b> on the venue's turf, drainage and irrigation system.|$|E
50|$|However, due {{to ongoing}} legal, {{ownership}} and funding issues, work stopped {{there for some}} eleven years, leaving the building to fall into a bad state of disrepair and an ongoing target for vandalism. Damage to the roof, windows, and guttering meant {{that for a long}} period, the building wasn't weather proof. In 2007, the Council issued an <b>Urgent</b> <b>Works</b> notice to the owners, which demanded that they carry out repairs. As no satisfactory repairs were made, the Council carried out this work themselves and billed the owners. The bill was never paid and was ultimately written off as a bad debt. In 2014, another <b>Urgent</b> <b>Works</b> notice was issued to the nine registered owners of the building. <b>Urgent</b> <b>Works</b> were finally carried out in 2015, to repair these parts of the building.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the walls}} of the tower {{collapsed}} around 1900, and as of 2014, English Heritage considered the condition of the castle to be very bad and <b>urgent</b> <b>works</b> are required. [...] Arnside Tower is a Scheduled Monument and Grade II* listed building.|$|R

25|$|In 2002 the World Monuments Fund placed Stowe House on its List of Most Endangered Sites. The {{school had}} done {{its best to}} keep the house in good repair, {{including}} re-roofing the State Dining Room in 1990, repair of the north elevation of the West Pavilion in 1992 and the repair of the Marble Saloon's oculus skylight in 1994. On taking over ownership {{of the house in}} 1997, the Stowe House Preservation Trust commissioned a survey in order to scope the problem {{and come up with a}} restoration plan. The result was a six-phase plan, starting with the most <b>urgent</b> <b>work.</b> The estimated cost in 2002 for all six phases was nearly £40 million.|$|E
25|$|Of his cathedral restorations, {{inspired}} as {{they were}} by the mistaken idea that a medieval church ought to be homogeneous in style and unencumbered by screens, monuments, and other obtrusive relics of the past, {{it can only be}} said that the Chapters who employed him were no more enlightened than their architect, and that at Westminster Abbey at least he accomplished an <b>urgent</b> <b>work</b> of repair in an unexceptionable manner. His activities at Salisbury, Durham, Hereford, and Lichfield were bitterly criticized by John Carter in his Pursuits of Architectural Innovation, and it was due in large measure to Carter's persistent denunciation that, in 1796, Wyatt failed to secure election as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. In the following year, however, he was permitted to add F.S.A. to his name by a majority of one hundred and twenty-three votes.|$|E
25|$|The {{squadron}} {{was also}} involved {{in the construction of}} the 1st Australian Logistics Support Group (1 ALSG) base amid the sand dunes at Vung Tau following its occupation in May 1966. Although a detachment of engineers from 1 RAR Group had commenced basic works to prepare the area prior to the lodgement, including a basic water supply and road construction, much work remained. Lacking basic facilities for logistic operations including unloading facilities, roads and hardstanding, 1 ALSG struggled to become operational and commence logistic support to 1 ATF forward at Nui Dat. Meanwhile, basic hygiene and stifling heat were also a significant problem. <b>Urgent</b> <b>work</b> was required and the development plan included cutting and spreading the sand dunes, reclaiming large areas of swamp land, road construction, establishing accommodation, hardstanding, storage areas, workshops and vehicles parks, as well as extensive drainage works. Other tasks included winning construction resources, water purification and supply, electricity generation, survey, bridging and rafting, and civil aid. Helipads were also constructed to enable 1 ALSG to be resupplied by helicopter and for 2 Field Ambulance to receive casualties. Later, in April 1968 a quarry was also constructed at Vung Tau to supply crushed rock, gravel and fine sand for the pavement of roads, airfields, helipads and development of hardstanding.|$|E

50|$|In 2009-2010, ARTA did major {{remedial}} {{work on the}} wharf structure, which had not had such work done since construction.

2500|$|... "Simply {{advocating for}} a {{rejection}} of current stereotypical categories and narratives would inevitably lead {{to the establishment of}} equally limiting [...] categories of representation, and spending energy to create a counterdiscourse will perhaps unwittingly reify the false binary that already frames much [...] of public understanding. The work of Arab American feminists, then, must continue to encourage a fruitful fluidity that constantly forges new [...] possibilities for understanding and contextualizing the complex realities of Arab and Arab American women’s lives. In solidarity with social justice and [...] liberation projects worldwide, we must mindfully utilize the tools of an oppositional consciousness in order to support the <b>urgent</b> <b>work</b> of carving and [...] crafting new spaces for the expression of Arab American feminisms. Rather than simply resisting the politics of invisibility that have denied us a full [...] presence, we must mobilize it, thereby reinventing and transforming that invisibility into a tool with which we will continue to illustrate the brilliant [...] complexities of Arab and Arab American women’s lives".|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Ament, {{against whom}} Mark aims the hasty shafts of his ridicule and denunciation, {{is one of}} the heroic men of peace who {{distinguished}} themselves in the defense of the British Legation. He has been a leader in the great and <b>urgent</b> <b>work</b> of relieving the necessities of the native Christians of the northern provinces, or of those who escaped the Boxer sword. In pursuance of this work, he has secured money contributions from the villages where the native Christians suffered. It does not appear that Mr. Ament has used any force to accomplish this. It does not appear that he has secured any more money than was essential to feed and clothe his native wards, and to re-establish them in dwellings. This is a work of Christian charity, defensible on the most elementary grounds of justice. When Mark Twain accuses Dr. Ament and his fellow missionaries of [...] "looting" [...] he manifests a mental and moral obliquity which astonishes and pains his New England neighbors and admirers.|$|E
2500|$|However, with Halabi's {{property}} {{empire in}} serious trouble due to the housing market's collapse, the project seems to have stalled. English Heritage has {{placed it on the}} [...] "At Risk register" [...] and the house needs <b>urgent</b> <b>work</b> on the roof and chimneys. There is concern that weather will penetrate to the interiors, considered among the finest examples of Victorian design and craftsmanship in Britain. Halabi's property company, Buckingham Securities Holdings, was also proposing to develop the In & Out Club at 79–81 Piccadilly, London, also known as Cambridge House, before it became the Naval and Military Club and once occupied by Lord Palmerston. The intention was to turn both properties into Europe's first six-star hotels, one located in town and the other to be the sister Country Manor hotel with 36 hole private golf club. The original architects, EPR were replaced by AFR in 2005 but the development stalled in 2007. In 2004 Hotel Design Inc were retained as interior designers for both projects leading to a 2005 launch event for the marketing of the properties as a private members' club with hotel facilities (the PM Club).|$|E
50|$|Extensive {{restoration}} and consolidation work {{was carried out}} to Rufus Castle in 2010-2012 on behalf of English Heritage, under their scheme of repair and <b>urgent</b> <b>works.</b> The castle had been listed on the Heritage at Risk Register in 2010. Circa mid-2008, the castle was listed as being ruinous {{and in need of}} conservation repair and consolidation.|$|R

60|$|Some {{delicate}} and important work was being done, and Stuyvesant {{had had his}} lunch sent up to the dam.

Stuyvesant and Dick were hot and dirty, for it was not their custom to be content with giving orders when <b>urgent</b> <b>work</b> was going on. Bethune looked languid and immaculately neat. His speciality was mathematics, and he said he did not see why the man with mental talents should dissipate his energy by using his hands.|$|E

Still one feels that Sir Cohn's decision is a necessary one. It would never do to have six or seven thousand men shut up there, when there is <b>urgent</b> <b>work</b> to be done in a score of other places. Besides, it would need a vast magazine of provisions to maintain them. Our force, even when joined by the garrison, would be wholly inadequate for so tremendous a task as reducing to submission a city containing at least half-a-million inhabitants, together with thirty or forty thousand mutineers and a host of Oude's best men, with the advantage of the possession of a score or two of buildings, all of which are positive fortresses." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Hardy {{was very}} much pleased {{at the sight of}} the long rows of bricks lying in front of the house, and gave great credit to all for the amount of work which had been done during his few days' absence. The next morning he {{assigned}} to every one their share of the future work. Lopez and one of the peons went out with the horses, cattle, and sheep. After a time it would not be necessary to have two men employed for this work, as the cattle and horses, when they once became accustomed to their new home, would never wander very far. Charley, Hubert, and Terence were to take three yoke of oxen and the three ploughs, and to commence to get the land in order for cultivation; the ground selected as a beginning, being that lying below the house near the river. Mr. Hardy, Hans, and the two peons were to work at the house, and Seth was to finish the well, which, although begun, had been stopped during the press of more <b>urgent</b> <b>work,</b> and the water required had been fetched from the stream in a barrel placed in a bullock-cart. The way in which adobé or mud houses are constructed is as follows:--The mud is prepared as for brick-making; but instead of being made into bricks, it is made at once into the wall. The foundation having been dug out and levelled, two boards are placed on edge eighteen inches or two feet apart. These are kept in their places by two pieces of wood nailed across them. The space between these boards is filled with mud, in which chopped hay and rushes have been mixed to bind it together. The boards are left for a day or two, while the builders proceed with the other part of the wall. They are then taken off, and the heat of the sun soon dries the wall into a mass almost as hard as a brick. The boards are then put on again higher up, and the process repeated until the walls have gained the desired height.|$|E
6000|$|... ...I {{seem to have}} {{followed}} your summer rather well and intimately and rejoicingly, thanks to Bill's impartings up to {{the time he left}} me, and to the beautiful direct and copious news aforesaid from yourself and from Alice, and I make out that I may deem things well with you when I see you so mobile and mobilizable (so emancipated and unchained for being so,) as well as so fecund and so still overflowing. Your annual go at Keene Valley (which I'm never to have so much as beheld) and the nature of your references to it--as this one to-night--fill me with pangs and yearnings--I mean the bitterness, almost, of envy: there is so little of the Keene Valley side of things in my life. But I went up to Scotland a month ago, for five days at John Cadwalader's (of N.Y.) vast [...] "shooting" [...] in Forfarshire (let to him out of Lord Dalhousie's real principality,) and there, in absolutely exquisite weather, had a brief but deep draught of the glory of moor and mountain, as that air, and ten-mile trudges through the heather and by the brae-side (to lunch with the shooters) delightfully give it. It was an exquisite experience. But those things are over, and I am [...] "settled in" [...] here, D.V., for a good quiet time of <b>urgent</b> <b>work</b> (during the season here that on the whole I love best, for it makes for concentration--and il n'y a que ça--for me!) which will float me, I trust, till the end of February; when I shall simply go up to London till the mid-May. No more [...] "abroad" [...] for me within any calculable time, heaven grant! Why the devil I didn't write to you after reading your Pragmatism--how I kept from it--I can't now explain save by the very fact of the spell itself (of interest and enthralment) that the book cast upon me; I simply sank down, under it, into such depths of submission and assimilation that any reaction, very nearly, even that of acknowledgment, would have had almost the taint of dissent or escape. Then I was lost in the wonder {{of the extent to which}} all my life I have (like M. Jourdain) unconsciously pragmatised. You are immensely and universally right, and I have been absorbing a number more of your followings-up of the matter in the American (Journal of Psychology?) which your devouring devotee Manton Marble ... plied, and always on invitation does ply, me with. I feel the reading of the book, at all events to have been really the event of my summer. In which connection (that of [...] "books"), I am infinitely touched by your speaking of having read parts of my American Scene (of which I hope Bill has safely delivered you the copy of the English edition) to Mrs. Bryce--paying them the tribute of that test of their value. Indeed the tribute of your calling the whole thing [...] "köstlich stuff" [...] and saying it will remain to be read so and really gauged, gives me more pleasure than I can say, and quickens my regret and pain at the way the fates have been all against (all finally and definitely now) my having been able to carry out my plan and do a second instalment, embodying more and complementary impressions. Of course I had a plan--and the second vol. would have attacked the subject (and my general mass of impression) at various other angles, thrown off various other pictures, in short contributed much more.
