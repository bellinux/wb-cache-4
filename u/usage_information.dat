40|$|Purpose – Since the 1990 s, {{there has}} been a growing {{interest}} in style of <b>information</b> <b>usage.</b> However, most studies on style of <b>information</b> <b>usage</b> are conducted in developed countries. There is limited research on style of <b>information</b> <b>usage</b> in developing countries. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to fill the gap in the existing literature by examining relationships between style of <b>information</b> <b>usage</b> and use of financial and non-financial information in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach – The authors adopted a survey method, for which a written questionnaire was prepared and mailed out to companies in Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Terengganu and Pulau Pinang. Findings – Findings of the study show that diagnostic style of <b>information</b> <b>usage</b> is positively associated with use of financial information, while interactive style of <b>information</b> <b>usage</b> is positively associated with use of non-financial information. Further analysis on types of non-financial information used by managers who adopt interactive style of <b>information</b> <b>usage</b> reveals that customer-related non-financial information such as quality, customer satisfaction and flexibility play a more important role in their decision-making processes. Originality/value – The paper provides insights into relationships between style of <b>information</b> <b>usage</b> on and use of accounting information in developing countries. Findings of the study can be applied to assist management accountants in meeting managers’ information requirements. <br /...|$|R
