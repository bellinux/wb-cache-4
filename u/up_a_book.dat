25|$|The Catcher in the Rye is narrated in a {{subjective}} style {{from the point}} of view of Holden Caulfield, following his exact thought processes. There is flow in the seemingly disjointed ideas and episodes; for example, as Holden sits in a chair in his dorm, minor events, such as picking <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> or looking at a table, unfold into discussions about experiences.|$|E
25|$|The Pennsylvania Gazette, {{like most}} other {{newspapers}} of the period, was often poorly printed. Franklin was busy with a hundred matters outside of his printing office, and never seriously attempted to raise the mechanical standards of his trade. Nor did he ever properly edit or collate the chance medley of stale items that passed for news in the Gazette. His influence on the practical side of journalism was minimal. On the other hand, his advertisements of books show his very great interest in popularizing secular literature. Undoubtedly his paper contributed to the broader culture that distinguished Pennsylvania from her neighbors before the Revolution. Like many publishers, Franklin built <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> shop in his printing office; he {{took the opportunity to}} read new books before selling them.|$|E

500|$|Her {{parents wanted}} to be {{independent}} so had sacrificed to buy a farm for the family. As a child, Mary would accompany her mother to deliver [...] "white people’s" [...] wash. Allowed {{to go into the}} white children’s nursery, Mary became fascinated with their toys. One day she picked <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> and as she opened it, a white child took it away from her, saying she didn’t know how to read. Mary decided then that the only difference between white and colored people was the ability to read and write. She was inspired to learn.|$|E
500|$|The Popular Science Review {{began by}} writing that [...] "We never {{remember}} {{to have taken}} <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> which gave us more pleasure". It was quite unlike the dull journey logs of most travel books; it was [...] "a romance, which is, nevertheless, plain matter of fact". The review especially admires the way that Wallace [...] "has generalised on the facts" [...] rather than just shooting [...] "a multitude of birds" [...] and interminably describing them. The account notes that Wallace was the joint originator {{of the theory of}} natural selection, and summarises the discovery of the Wallace line in some detail. The review ends by placing the Malay Archipelago between Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology and Darwin's Origin of Species.|$|E
500|$|In Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, Clarke infuses her dry wit with prosaic quaintness. For example, {{the narrator}} notes: [...] "It has been remarked (by a lady {{infinitely}} cleverer {{than the present}} author) how kindly disposed the world in general feels to young people who either die or marry. Imagine then the interest that surrounded Miss Wintertowne! No young lady ever had such advantages before: for she died upon the Tuesday, was raised {{to life in the}} early hours of Wednesday morning, and was married upon the Thursday; which some people thought too much excitement for one week." [...] As Michel Faber explains in his review for The Guardian, [...] "here we have all the defining features of Clarke's style simultaneously: the archly Austenesque tone, the somewhat overdone quaintness ("upon the Tuesday"), the winningly matter-of-fact use of the supernatural, and drollness to spare." [...] Gregory Maguire notes in The New York Times that Clarke even gently ridicules the genre of the novel itself: [...] " [...] picks <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> and begins to read...but he is not attending to what he reads and he has got to Page 22 before he discovers it is a novel– the sort of work which above all others he most despises– and he puts it down in disgust." [...] Elsewhere, the narrator remarks, [...] "Dear Emma does not waste her energies upon novels like other young women." [...] The narrator's identity has been a topic of discussion, with Clarke declaring that said narrator is female and omniscient rather than a future scholar from within the real storyline as some had suggested.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{also written}} by Asser that Alfred {{did not learn}} to read until he {{was twelve years old}} or later, which is {{described}} as [...] "shameful negligence" [...] of his parents and tutors. Alfred was an excellent listener and had an incredible memory and he retained poetry and psalms very well. A story is told by Asser about how his mother held <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> of Saxon poetry to him and his brothers, and said; [...] "I shall give this book to whichever one of you can learn it the fastest." [...] After excitedly asking, [...] "Will you really give this book to the one of us who can understand it the soonest and recite it to you?" [...] Alfred then took it to his teacher, learned it, and recited it back to his mother.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} {{paragraph}} of Plot It Yourself, Archie relates his own method of grading what Wolfe is reading, {{on a scale from}} A to D. If Wolfe picks <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> before he rings for beer, and if he has marked his place with a thin strip of gold given to him by a grateful client, the book is an A. [...] "I haven't kept score, but I would say that of the two hundred or so books he reads in a year not more than five or six get an A," [...] Archie writes. In The Red Box (chapter 12), Wolfe uses a thin strip of ebony to mark his place as he re-reads Seven Pillars of Wisdom. Archie indicates in various stories that Wolfe prefers to finish a paragraph before acknowledging an interruption in his reading. He often dog-ears a page to mark his place.|$|E
2500|$|Jean Ritchie {{was born}} to Abigail (née Hall) and Balis W. Ritchie of Viper, an unincorporated {{community}} in Perry County in the Cumberland Mountains of south eastern Kentucky. The Ritchies of Perry County {{were one of the}} two [...] "great ballad-singing families" [...] of Kentucky celebrated among folk song scholars (the other was the Combs family of adjacent Knott County, whose repertoire formed the basis of the first scholarly work on the British ballads in America, a doctoral thesis by Professor Josiah Combs of Berea College for the Sorbonne University published in Paris in 1925.) In 1917, the great collector Cecil Sharp collected songs from Jean's older sisters Una and May. Many of the Ritchies attended the Hindman Settlement School, a folk school, where people were encouraged to cherish their own backgrounds and where Sharp also found many of his songs. Jean's father Balis had printed <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> of old songs entitled Lovers' Melodies, and music making was an important activity in the Ritchie home.|$|E

2500|$|At 21 {{years of}} age he was {{diagnosed}} as having bipolar disorder, and has spoken candidly about his experiences {{with the effects of}} the illness. In his 31 December 2010 interview for The Sun, Ant also discussed the side effects of medication for his bipolar condition: [...] "In the past I've been a robot. It's been an out-of-body experience. Bipolar means up and down and that's me... Music has always been the best medication. I was on sodium valproate for seven years.... I couldn't get to sleep and I didn't make love for seven years. My hair fell out and I couldn't pick <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> as I couldn't concentrate. I didn't write a song or pick up a guitar in that time – and piled on the weight. I {{might as well have been}} dead. I work very closely with my GP and any decisions I make are made with him". During an interview with BBC Radio 6 Music, he declared that [...] "mental health needs a great deal of attention. It's the final taboo and it needs to be faced and dealt with." [...] Ant is involved in the Black Dog campaign, which promotes better understanding of mental illness.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first account}} to include this detail is the {{so-called}} Vita altera Bonifatii, which was written in Utrecht (the closest Frankish/Christian settlement to Friesland) and which is preserved in a revision ascribed to Utrecht's bishop, Radbod, who held the seat from 900–917. It is repeated in most other vitae that followed, of which Otloh of St. Emmeram's (eleventh century) is the most important. This book, though it is called a [...] "gospel" [...] in the Utrecht and Otloh vitae, is usually identified with the Ragyndrudis Codex. Adding to the Schutzhypothese are five deep cuts which appear to strengthen the theory, but von Padberg argues that the position and character of the cuts do not match the hypothesis; in addition, Boniface was an uncommonly tall man, which {{makes it even more}} unlikely that such cuts would have been made while he held the Codex over his head. According to von Padberg, the Codices Bonifatiani must have left Utrecht and been in Fulda in 825, or the Utrecht tradition would have more clearly identified them. Images of the saint holding <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> for protection are being produced in Fulda by the year 970, when a series of sacramentaries are illustrated with images of Boniface's work as a missionary and his martyrdom.|$|E
