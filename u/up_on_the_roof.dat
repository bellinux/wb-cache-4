5|$|Nesbitt {{has also}} taken on {{theatrical}} roles throughout his career; between 1987 and 1994, {{he appeared in}} no less than five major plays, including the musical <b>Up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Roof,</b> a world tour of Hamlet, and the Troubles drama Paddywack. After a break of eleven years, Nesbitt returned to the stage to make his London West End debut in Owen McCafferty's Shoot the Crow (2005).|$|E
5|$|The band of robbers, now at home, {{are about}} to start {{splitting}} their stolen goods equally, when the police barge in. While three of the robbers are subdued after a fight, one manages to make his escape via a window and ends <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof.</b> The two policeman chase the criminal, who eludes them by jumping from rooftop to rooftop. After the robber jumps down to the street, he runs toward the railroad station and boards a departing train. The police officers arrive but are too late, as the robber has left. The officers tell the train dispatcher to send a telegram to the next station, informing them of the fugitive and asking them to catch {{him as soon as}} possible. When the train reaches the next station, the burglar exits the train and unknowingly runs right into the path of policemen. With all four of the robbers caught, they are sentenced to forty years in jail. While doing work in the jail's quarry, the group review their failure, with each robber pinning the blame on another.|$|E

The property was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987, but Marlin failed {{to preserve the}} building while it was in bankruptcy. Visitors continued to tour the structure until 1989, when it was declared unsafe, and closed. During the winter of 1991 ice built <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> and in drainpipes lead to the partial collapse of an exterior wall.|$|E

25|$|Detailed {{instructions}} were {{given for the}} careful concealment of pillboxes and other field defences and all pillboxes would have been camouflaged. Many were dug into the ground or inserted into a hedgerow or hillside to provide the lowest possible profile; others had soil piled <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> and sides. Camouflage paint schemes and camouflage netting {{would be used to}} help break up the outline. Use was made of local materials: concrete made with beach sand, a covering of beach pebbles, or stone from a nearby cliff was not only a time saving measure but aided camouflage by helping the defences to merge into the background.|$|E

"But, {{as soon as}} {{the people}} {{perceived}} their object, they ran together in such vast crowds that the Roman soldiers could not cut their way through the mass which blocked up the streets; while the more active men, going <b>up</b> <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> <b>roofs,</b> hurled down stones and missiles upon the troops.|$|R

50|$|According to Greg Tims, Traditionally, a roof stomp {{is where}} you greet a new {{commander}} or celebrate some sort of special occasion by climbing <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> commander's <b>roof</b> and begin to make a LOT of noise while others are outside banging <b>on</b> <b>the</b> windows and doors. When he or she opens the door, the commander invites the group in for food and drink.|$|R
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by George Meyer and {{directed}} by David Silverman. It was the first script Meyer wrote on the show, {{and he thought he}} made [...] "quite a few mistakes, but it turned out really well overall." [...] The staff decided to do a Thanksgiving episode after they found out that an episode would air on Thursday, November 22, 1990, the date of Thanksgiving that year. The Simpsons had previously aired at 8:00p.m. EST on Sunday night but the Fox network switched its timeslot to the same time on Thursdays {{at the beginning of the}} second season. The idea of Bart going <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> was suggested by Meyer who used to go <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> himself when he had fights with his family.|$|E
500|$|William James Nesbitt, [...] (born 15 January 1965) is {{an actor}} and {{presenter}} from Northern Ireland. Born in Ballymena, County Antrim, Nesbitt {{grew up in the}} nearby village of Broughshane, before moving to Coleraine, County Londonderry. He wanted to become a teacher like his father, so he began a degree in French at the University of Ulster. He dropped out after a year when he decided to become an actor, and transferred to the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. After graduating in 1987, he spent seven years performing in plays that varied from the musical <b>Up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Roof</b> (1987, 1989) to the political drama Paddywack (1994). He made his feature film debut playing talent agent Fintan O'Donnell in Hear My Song (1991).|$|E
500|$|While filming, Steve Carell and Tim Meadows improvised a lot {{of their}} dinner scene, but most of it never made the final cut. One improvised scene that did make the final cut was the [...] "Baby Back Ribs" [...] song. In an interview, Jenna Fischer said that the rooftop scene was her {{favorite}} to shoot. Fischer recalled that [...] "there was a very small crew <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> and they had the cameras really far away." [...] After the main shooting ended, producers decided to do a re-shoot to explain the [...] "Dwigt" [...] situation clearly and concisely. The kiss between Michael and Jan was rehearsed and filmed [...] "many, many, many times", according to B. J. Novak. While editing the kiss between Michael and Jan, Greg Daniels brought many people into the editing room to see if they thought the kiss was too long or not long enough.|$|E

60|$|I {{have told}} you how the Venetians kept glass-making a secret, and how, at last, the Germans learned it, and then the French, and their work came to be better liked {{than that of the}} Venetians. But these last still managed to keep the process of making mirrors a {{profound}} secret, and the French were determined to get at the mystery. Several young glass-makers went from France to Venice, and applied to all the looking-glass makers of Venice for situations as workmen, that they might learn the art. But all positively refused to receive them, and kept their doors and windows tightly closed while they were at work, that no one might see what they did. The young Frenchmen took advantage of this, and climbed <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs,</b> and cautiously made holes through which they could look; and thus they learned the carefully-kept secret, and went back to France and commenced the manufacture of glass mirrors. Twenty years after, a Frenchman invented founding glass, which gave France such a great advantage that the trade of Venice in looking-glasses was ruined.|$|R
500|$|The {{day after}} leaving CSSD in 1987, Nesbitt {{got a bit}} part in Virtuoso, a BBC Two Screen Two {{television}} play {{about the life of}} John Ogdon. He worked for two days on the play, earning Â£250 per day. His first professional stage appearance came in the same year, when he played Keith in <b>Up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Roof.</b> The musical ran at the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, before transferring to the London West End. Nesbitt reprised the role when the production returned to Plymouth in early 1989. Roger Malone in The Stage and Television Today wrote that Nesbitt [...] "steals the show with the best lines and best delivery as he laconically squares up to life with an easy contentment". Nesbitt appeared in two other plays in 1989; in June, he played Dukes Frederick and Senior in Paul Jepson's As You Like It at the Rose Theatre Club, and then appeared in Yuri Lyubimov's version of Hamlet. Hamlet had been translated back to English from Boris Pasternak's Russian translation. It ran at the Haymarket Theatre, Leicester for a month before a transfer to the Old Vic and then a nine-month world tour. Nesbitt played Guildenstern, Barnardo and the second gravedigger. He recalled that the play received [...] "shocking" [...] reviews, but was exciting.|$|E

He had eliminated {{much of the}} thievery that had kept the refugees nervous and frightened.

When ditches were dug, he was there with a hoe." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the next}} round, the {{remaining}} 87 contestants performed in groups in three. [...] The {{girls and boys}} were separate and they were each given 3 different songs to choose - Girls with The Supremes' You Can't Hurry Love, Vonda Shepard's [...] "Tell Him", [...] Candi Staton's Young Hearts Run Free, the boys with Billy Joel's Tell Her About It, Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up, The Drifters's <b>Up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Roof.</b> [...] 30 contestants were cut and 57 then advanced to the next stage where they performed solo. The contestants were then divided into 3 group and placed in separate rooms, with one group sent home. [...] 32 contestants remained for the semi-finals.|$|E
60|$|This was done, {{and early}} the {{following}} morning, {{when the whole}} palace was wrapped in sleep, she stole <b>up</b> <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> <b>roof,</b> where <b>the</b> prince was already awaiting her, with his horse's head towards Persia. He mounted first and helped the princess up behind; then, when she was firmly seated, with her hands holding tightly to his belt, he touched the screw, and the horse began to leave the earth quickly behind him.|$|R

Merely Comrade Gooch. If you will get through the skylight, I will pass him up to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|He tumbled off the seat, {{opened the}} locker, {{and had the}} {{portfolio}} open before him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> folding-table. It was full of drawings done in the peculiar flat style and conventional colours engineers adopt. And, in, addition there were some rather under-exposed photographs, obviously done by an amateur, at close quarters, of the actual machine's mutterings had made, in its shed near the Crystal Palace. Bert found he was trembling. [...] "Lord" [...] he said, [...] "here am I and the whole blessed secret of flying--lost <b>up</b> here <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of everywhere.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{experimental}} model, with a [...] antenna, was set <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of the Radiation Lab. Although crude, it {{demonstrated that}} the basic idea was sound. A [...] version followed late in 1942, and then an [...] one with 108 dipoles in early 1943. It was {{pointed out that the}} dihedral and sweepback of most aircraft would make installation of an in-wing scanner difficult, and aeroelastic loads during flight, especially [...] "flapping", would be a serious concern. The team moved to a [...] long model with 252 dipoles, mounted in a separate streamlined wing-like enclosure. The width was limited to 16feet simply because that was the largest wood planer the team could access. Two dipoles were later removed at the request of an industrial partner who preferred to work with round numbers.|$|E
2500|$|That night dark {{storm clouds}} swirl around the house. Suddenly, the four glowing pods {{land on the}} roof. An alien crew emerges, made up of Skip (J. K. Simmons), the tough commander, Tazer (Thomas Haden Church), a muscle-bound dude armed to the teeth, Razor (Kari Wahlgren), a lethal female alien soldier, and Sparks (Josh Peck), a four-armed techie, who is the only non-threatening intruder. Since the aliens knocked over the {{satellite}} dish Ricky and Tom are sent to fix it. Ricky then reveals to Tom that he lied about his car breaking down, and his age; Ricky is actually in college and is 21 years old, five years older than Bethany. Ricky makes Tom fix the satellite dish by himself but it is beyond repair. Investigating further, Tom and Jake (who unexpectedly shows <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof)</b> discover the aliens. Ricky is captured and implanted with a mind control device. The aliens, called [...] "Zirkonians", lay claim to the planet. Like a puppet, Ricky grabs the boys â but Tom and Jake break free and {{get back in the}} house.|$|E

60|$|Presently {{the train}} began to move. Fortunately, {{at the spot}} where it drew up, a group of their acquaintances were {{clustered}} together, and these all managed to get into the truck, which was speedily filled up until there was scarce standing-room. Three minutes later <b>the</b> train moved <b>on.</b> A great number were left behind, although everyone made as much room as possible, women especially being helped in after the trucks seemed absolutely choke-full. As soon as the train was fairly in motion many of <b>the</b> men climbed <b>up</b> <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> of <b>the</b> covered waggons, thereby relieving the pressure below, and enabling all the women to sit down. Others ranged themselves along <b>the</b> sides, sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rail, and so minimizing the space they occupied. But even with all this, the women were packed inconveniently together. All, however, were so much pleased at their good fortune in having got away that there was no complaining or grumbling. That the journey would be a long one, all knew; but at least they had started, and would soon be a free people in a free country. Chris and his friends had been among the first to climb <b>up</b> <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> <b>roof,</b> and they sat down in a group at one end of it.|$|R
5000|$|The story {{opens with}} several hens {{mothering}} their chicks {{in an ideal}} suburban fashion: taking them on walks and bragging to fellow hens about their exploits. One of the hens jokingly tells Miss Prissy that she is lucky not to have chicks to looks after, then Prissy overhears a group of hens saying that she will [...] "never land a man" [...] because she is [...] "too much of a D-R-I-P." [...] This depresses Prissy who then climbs <b>up</b> <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of <b>the</b> barn.|$|R
50|$|At the Underworld Christmas party Karen {{started to}} have stomach pains {{and it was}} later {{confirmed}} that she had miscarried.

6000|$|So I {{was obliged}} to go off as quickly as might be; {{and the next morning}} Mamma and my sisters made breakfast for me at four, and at five came the [...] "True Blue" [...] light six-inside post-coach to London, and I got <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> without having seen Mary Smith.|$|E
