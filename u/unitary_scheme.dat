40|$|A {{connection}} between the <b>unitary</b> quantization <b>scheme</b> suggested by Govorkov and para-Fermi statistics of order 2 is considered. An appropriate extension of Green's ansatz is suggested. The extension made possible to turn the Govorkov bilinear and trilinear commutation relations for the annihilation and creation operators of two different para-Fermi fields ϕ_a and ϕ_b into identity. The way of incorporating para-Grassmann numbers ξ_k into a general scheme of uniquantization is also offered. For parastatistics of order 2 a new fact is revealed, namely, the trilinear relations containing both the para-Grassmann variables ξ_k and the field operators a_k, b_m under a certain invertible mapping go over into the unitary equivalent relations, where commutators are replaced by anticommutators and vice versa. It is shown that the consequence of this circumstance is the existence of two alternative definitions of the coherent state for para-Fermi oscillators. The Klein transformation for Green's components of the operators a_k and b_m is constructed in an explicit form that enables us to reduce the initial commutation rules for the components to the normal commutation relations of ordinary Fermi fields. A nontrivial {{connection between}} the Govorkov trilinear relations and the so-called Lie-supertriple system is analysed.

40|$|In encryption, non-malleability is {{a highly}} {{desirable}} property: it ensures that adversaries cannot manipulate the plaintext by acting on the ciphertext. Ambainis, Bouda and Winter gave a definition of non-malleability for the encryption of quantum data. In this work, we show that this definition is too weak, as it allows adversaries to "inject" plaintexts of their choice into the ciphertext. We give a new definition of quantum non-malleability which resolves this problem. Our definition is {{expressed in terms of}} entropic quantities, considers stronger adversaries, and does not assume secrecy. Rather, we prove that quantum non-malleability implies secrecy; this is {{in stark contrast to the}} classical setting, where the two properties are completely independent. For <b>unitary</b> <b>schemes,</b> our notion of non-malleability is equivalent to encryption with a two-design (and hence also to the definition of Ambainis et al.).

We show that "total authentication" (a notion recently proposed by Garg, Yuen and Zhandry) can be satisfied with two-designs, a significant improvement over the eight-design construction of Garg et al. We also show that, under a mild adaptation of the rejection procedure, both total authentication and our notion of non-malleability yield quantum authentication as defined by Dupuis, Nielsen and Salvail.

30|$|Although {{both the}} ancilla-driven and ancilla-controlled models require the minimum {{possible}} {{access to the}} computational register, they replace the local control of the register with local control of the ancillary system and so still require more than one fixed quantum gate to implement universal computation. Halil-Shah and Oi [31] have recently shown that the measurement-based ancilla-driven model can be adapted so that no local control, beyond ancilla preparation in a fixed state, is required of either the ancilla or the register. In this model, the computation can be achieved using a fixed interaction and ancilla measurement in the computational basis alone. However, this requires a stochastic repeat-until-success style gate scheme [32], whereby one has to wait until a random walk through the set of unitaries is within the required precision of the desired unitary. In this paper we will show {{that it is possible}} to develop deterministic models that require only a single fixed ancilla-register interaction and ancilla preparation in the computational basis with no ancilla measurements necessary. Such schemes require a minimal level of control of both the ancillary and register systems whilst allowing for universal quantum computation. Hence, we will refer to such models as minimal control models of ancilla-mediated quantum computation, and we will often drop the reference to ancilla-mediation for brevity. In Section  3 we introduce two such schemes based on locally inequivalent interactions. The first of these models requires multiple ancillas to implement entangling two-qubit gates on the register and so, although it requires minimal control, it has an overhead in terms of ancilla use. We then develop an alternative minimal control model which does not have this ancilla overhead and requires only three ancilla-register interactions per two-qubit entangling gate, the minimum possible in any <b>unitary</b> <b>scheme</b> [33]. We briefly discuss the physical implementation of these models before concluding in Section  4. We begin in Section  2 with some essential definitions.|$|E
