40|$|AbstractUltra-light {{and very}} light amphibious aircrafts are the special kinds of {{low-speed}} general aircrafts. They are low weighted and small sized but can takeoff and land either on land or water without changing {{the structure of}} any parts. These characteristics result in the distinctive configuration and structure design, and meanwhile bring about significant features of safety and airworthiness design. These problems are investigated by developing the <b>ultra-light</b> amphibious <b>aircraft</b> “Frigate bird” and analyzing the other aircrafts’ design. This paper mainly discusses the preliminary design about structure, aerodynamics, power effect, flying qualities, dynamics and statics on water.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a vision-based {{detection}} and tracking algorithm for UAS non cooperative collision avoidance. It is based on top-hat and bottom-hat morphological filtering, local image analysis for a limited set of regions of interest, and a multi-frame tracking algorithm in stabilized coordinates {{that is used to}} confirm intruder detection. Once this detection is achieved, template matching-based algorithms are used to track the intruder in subsequent frames. The developed technique has been tested using flight data gathered in the framework of the sense and avoid research project carried out by the Italian Aerospace Research Center and the Department of Industrial Engineering of the university of Naples “Federico II”. First results are promising: considering two frontal encounters in completely different illumination conditions, range for confirmed detection of an <b>ultra-light</b> intruder <b>aircraft</b> is in both cases of the order of 2. 5 km, no false tracks are generated, and angular measurement accuracy in North-East-Down coordinates is of the order of 0. 1 °.

40|$|II Inspired {{by flying}} animals in nature {{especially}} birds, human has designed {{and attempted to}} achieve man-powered flapping wing aircraft in very early aviation history. Limited by {{the understanding of the}} aerodynamic theory and materials in practise, the bird-like aircraft remains as a dream and ambition for over a contrary. As the relevant knowledge and technology are fast developing in the last decade, the research topic becomes attractive again with encouraging results from a few full scale aircraft flight tests. Although it is suspected that a manned scale flapping wing may not be as efficient as fixed wing, the unique advantages of high manoeuvrability and short take-off and landing capability will keep flapping wing {{as one of the most}} potential type of personal and aerobatic aircraft in the future market. The aim of this project is to investigate into the feasibility and development of a bio-inspired bird-like man-powered <b>ultra-light</b> flapping wing <b>aircraft</b> (ULFWA). The project is based on analytical and experimental study of a scaled model taking an existing hang glider as the baseline airframe. Based on the characteristics of flying animals in nature and manmade hang glider properties, this thesis focuses its study on evaluating the feasibility and analysis of primarily a human powered aircraft. For this purpose, there are four main features as guidance in the ULFWA design. Firstly the flapping frequency was limited to below 2 Hz. Secondly the hang glider airframe was adapted with a simple flapping mechanism design. Thirdly the flapping wing stroke and kinematics has been kept with the simplest and resonant movement to achieve high mechanical efficiency. Finally the wing structure has flexible rib of chord wise unsymmetrical bending stiffness to offset the aerodynamic lift loss in upstroke. An engine powered mechanism design was also studied as additional option of the ULFWA. The initial design and aerodynamic calculation of the ULFWA was based on the hang glider data including dimensions, MTOW (226 kg) and cruising speed. The unsteady aerodynamic lift and thrust forces were calculated based on Theodorsen’s theory and unsteady panel method in 2 D and extended to 3 D using strip theory. A set of optimal flapping kinematic parameters such as amplitude and combination of the heaving and pitching motion of the 2 D wing section were determined by calculation and comparison in the limited range. Considering the maximum power and lag motion that human could achieve, the flapping frequency in the ULFWA design is limited to 1 Hz. This slow motion leads to a much lower propulsive efficiency in terms of the optimum Strouhal Number (St= 0. 2 - 0. 4), which was used as the design reference. Mechanism and structure design with inertia force calculation was then completed based on the kinematics. This led to the evaluation of power requirement, which was divided into two components, drag and inertia forces. The results show that the ULFWA needs minimum 2452. 25 W (equals to 3. 29 Bhp) to maintain sustainable cruise flight. In order to demonstrate the ULFWA flapping mechanism and structure design, a 1 : 10 scaled model with two pairs of wings of different stiffness were built for testing and measurement. Two servomotors were used as to simulate human power actuation. With this model, simplified structure and one of mechanism designs was shown. Four experiments were carried out to measure the model’s lift and thrust force. Because of the limited response of the servo motors, the maximum flapping frequency achieved is only 0. 75 Hz in the specified flapping amplitude which is close to reality and has improvement margin. By reducing the flapping amplitude, the frequency can be increased to gain higher thrust. Although it is fund that the result from scaled model test is a little lower than theoretical result, it has demonstrated the feasibility and potential of human powered flapping wings aircraft...|$|R
