The {{structural}} {{characteristics of}} low S (0. 025 %), low Al (< 0. 003 %) and 4. 0 % carbon equivalent (CE) electric melted grey irons were studied at different solidification rates, for Ca and Ca,RE [Mischmetal] as the inoculating elements. Despite {{a relatively high}} CE, this base iron is sensitive to undercooling during solidification. A conventional Ca-FeSi inoculant is not recommended for these critical conditions, especially to avoid <b>undercooled</b> <b>graphite</b> morphologies. It is only adequate to control free carbides, for castings with more than 15 mm section. Rare earth (RE) bearing CaFeSi alloy {{appears to be a}} more effective solution, at least for castings with more than 5 mm section to control carbides, even the “end effect”, and promote a homogeneous structure. <b>Undercooled</b> <b>graphite</b> presence was limited and avoided in more than 10 mm section. Thin wall castings, less than 5 mm section, requiring stronger control for carbides and <b>undercooled</b> <b>graphite</b> formation, should not be produced from this type of base iron, unless more efficient inoculation can be accomplished...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the influence of four impurities S, Te, O, and H on structure control in the directional solidification of Fe-C-Si alloys. In the course of the solidification experiments, it was also observed that control of the solidification atmosphere by either H[subscript] 2 or O[subscript] 2 gas had a substantial influence on the microstructure. Both the S and H had similar effects on the gray solidification. Their effects were demonstrated by coarsening of the type A flake graphite structures and also by the promotion of the type A growth at higher velocities, compared to the results obtained from the solidification of high purity alloys under pure Ar atmosphere. The S effect was different from the H effect in that the former induced fine type D <b>undercooled</b> <b>graphite</b> and the latter coral graphite when the type A growth was terminated upon increasing the solidification velocity. In contrast to the S and H, it was found that the O suppressed the type A growth in high purity alloys, which was replaced by the growth of coral graphite at an extremely low solidification rate;The Auger analysis in Part II showed that the iron matrix/graphite interface regions were contaminated by the adsorbed elements S or O when the graphite solidified in flake morphology, type A or D, in both high purity and S-added alloys. The O presence was, however, observed only in coarse type A structure. The experiments in Part III produced evidence supporting that both the type A and D graphite grow by the extension of basal growth layers. Part IV of this study produced evidence that the interaction of the H with Te, as opposed to independent action of H, is primarily responsible for the enhancement of Te effectiveness in promoting white iron growth. The experimental results of the present study lead to the conclusion that the presence of impurity elements, either by doping addition (S and Te) or by atmosphere control (H and O), controls the structure of cast iron through the adsorption at the growth front (S and Te) or through the interaction with O (H).

40|$|Research was {{conducted}} to understand the nucleation mechanism of graphite flakes and nodules {{and the effect of}} various elements on the growth morphology of graphite. Investigations were started on flake graphite cast iron. The effect of S on the graphite morphology and MnS was experimentally analysed. The influence of various type of oxides on the growth morphology of MnS and their relation with the graphite growth morphology was studied carefully through series of experiments, and results were related to the thermodynamic calculations, performed to predict the nucleation of oxides and sulfides at any temperature. The calculations were supported by EDX analysis on particles in the samples, showing sequential nucleation of flake graphite. The austenite volume fraction and the dendrite growth orientations were affected by the addition of Al to the melt. The effect of aluminium oxide and sulfur was studied on the austenite growth morphology with the help of colour etching technique. Thermal analyses were performed to study the effect of sulfur content on austenite volume fraction and growth morphology using DSC. The latent heat of solidification and the rate of austenite formation was studied and related to the sulfur content in the alloy. To study the effect of O and S on the graphite morphology, pure Fe-C alloy was prepared and strong de-oxidizers and de-sulfurizer (Mg, Ca and Sr) were tested. With the help of ion etching and polishing, we were able to reveal the graphite growth morphology. The morphological changes in the graphite were explained by relating it to the composition of the melt in regard of dissolved S and O in the melt. The effect of other trace elements such as S, F, O, N, P, B and Se, was also investigated by testing them on an ultra-pure Fe-C alloy. The possibility of substituting a foreign atom in the basal plane of graphite was analysed based on the bonding energy between C and the foreign atoms. The resulting change {{in the structure of the}} basal plane was studied using Avogadro software and the resulting model were compared with the experimental results. The basal plane of nodular, flake and <b>undercooled</b> <b>graphite</b> was studied with the help of HRTEM, which showed differences in the lattice spacing between different graphite morphologies. The latent heat measurement showed that flake graphite have higher energy than the undercooled or vermicular graphite. This research made us enabled to tell about the growth along c-plane in graphite and the reason behind the transition of graphite morphology. The effect of inoculation temperature and inoculation sequence on the nodularity was studied. EDX analysis were performed and the results were compared to the thermodynamic calculations.   It was found that, the melt composition is controlling the graphite growth morphologies. Strong de-oxidizers and de-sulfurizer are necessary to reduce O and S to a level where it does not influence the graphite growth morphology. The effect of various elements on the activity of oxygen in the melt is calculated. High Al cast iron was also studied. The major problem associated with this type of alloy was that, the Mg was not effective in producing nodular graphite. Experiments showed that de-oxidizers stronger than Mg are required to increase the nodularity. Thermodynamic calculations showed that the activity of oxygen in the melt was changing strongly by increasing the Al content in the alloy. This was increasing the required oxygen level to nucleate MgO. QC 20141107 </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Successful {{inoculation}} is {{not guaranteed}} and effects {{may even be}} deleterious. The main risks are the appearance of types B and D graphite, associated with ferrite and/or carbides {{due to lack of}} control of undercooling during eutectic solidification. Alternatively coarse type C graphite in hypo to eutectic grey irons may result from inadequate or excessive inoculation. Sulphur and aluminium content in a molten iron are considered to be the main factors to control the degree of eutectic <b>undercooling,</b> <b>graphite</b> morphology and inoculation efficiency. Thermal conditions, such as superheating, inoculation and pouring temperature {{play an important role in}} controlling these effects. Cooling rates due to different mould materials and casting thickness were also considered. In order to resolve individual problems, different inoculant systems have to be considered, such as Sr-FeSi, Ca-FeSi, Ti,Ca-FeSi, Zr,Ca-FeSi, Ba,Ca-FeSi, RE-FeSi (Ca). The present paper made a synthesis of other published papers by the authors, but also added many original un-published results...|$|R

40|$|This thesis work {{deals with}} the volume changes during the {{solidification}} of cast irons and peritectic steels. The volume changes in casting metals {{are related to the}} expansion and/or contraction of the molten metal during solidification. Often, different types of shrinkage, namely macro- and micro-shrinkage, affect the casting quality. In addition to that, exposure of the metal casting to higher contraction or expansion during the solidification might also be related to internal strain development in samples, which eventually leads to surface crack propagation in some types of steel alloys during continuous casting. In consequence, a deep understanding of the mechanisms and control of the solidification will improve casting quality and production. All of the experiments during the entire work were carried out on laboratory scale samples. Displacement changes during solidification were measured {{with the help of a}} Linear Variable Displacement Transformer (LVDT). All of the LVDT experiments were performed on samples inside a sand mould. Simultaneously, the cooling curves of the respective samples during solidification were recorded with a thermocouple. By combining the displacement and cooling curves, the volume changes was evaluated and later used to explain the influence of inoculants, carbon and cooling rates on volume shrinkages of the casting. Hypoeutectic grey cast iron (GCI) and nodular cast iron (NCI) with hypo-, hyper- and eutectic carbon compositions were considered in the experiments from cast iron group. High nickel alloy steel (Sandvik Sanbar  64) was also used from peritectic steel type. These materials were melted inside an induction furnace and treated with different types of inoculants before and during pouring in order to modify the composition. Samples that were taken from the LVDT experiments were investigated using a number of different  methods in order to support the observations from the displacement measurements:  Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA), to evaluate the different phase present; Dilatometry, to see the effect of cooling rates on contraction for the various types of alloys; metallographic studies with optical microscopy; Backscattered electrons (BSE) analysis on SEM S- 3700 N, to investigate the different types of oxide and sulphide nuclei; and bulk density measurements  by applying Archimedes' principle. Furthermore, the experimental volume expansion during solidification was compared with the theoretically calculated values for GCI and NCI. It was found that the casting shows hardly any shrinkage during early solidification in GCI, but in the eutectic region the casting expands until the end of solidification. The measured and the calculated volume changes are close to one another, but the former shows more expansion. The addition of MBZCAS (Si, Ca, Zr, Ba, Mn and Al) promotes more flake graphite, and ASSC (Si, Ca, Sr and Al) does not increase the number of eutectic cells by much. In addition to that, it lowers the primary austenite fraction, promotes more eutectic growth and decreases <b>undercooled</b> <b>graphite</b> and secondary dendritic arm spacing (SDAS). As a result, the volume expansion changes in the eutectic region. The expansion during the eutectic growth increase with an increase in the inoculant weight percentage. At the same time, the eutectic cells become smaller and increase in number. The effect of the inoculant and the superheat temperature shows a variation in the degree of expansion/contraction and the cooling rates for the experiments. Effective inoculation tends to homogenize the eutectic structure, reducing the undercooled and interdendritic graphite throughout the structure. In NCI experiments, it was found that the samples showed no expansion in the transversal direction due to higher micro-shrinkages in the centre, whereas in the longitudinal direction the samples shows expansion until solidification was complete.    The theoretical and measured volume changes agreed with each other. The austenite fraction and number of micro-shrinkage pores decreased with increase in carbon content. The nodule count and distribution changes with carbon content. The thermal contraction of NCI is not influenced by the variation in carbon content at lower cooling rates. The structural analysis and solidification simulation results for NCI show that the nodule size and count distribution along the cross-sections at various locations are different due to the variation in cooling rates and carbon concentration. Finer nodule graphite appears in the thinner sections and close to the mold walls. A coarser structure is distributed mostly in the last solidified location. The simulation result indicates that finer nodules are associated with higher cooling rate and a lower degree of microsegregation, whereas the coarser nodules are related to lower cooling rate and a higher degree of microsegregation. As a result, this structural variation influences the micro-shrinkage in different parts. The displacement change measurements show that the peritectic steel expands and/or contracts during the solidification. The primary austenite precipitation during the solidification in the metastable region is accompanied by gradual expansion on the casting sides. Primary δ-ferrite precipitation under stable phase diagram is complemented by a severe contraction during solidification. The microstructural analysis reveals that the only difference between the samples is grain refinement with Ti addition. Moreover, the severe contraction in solidification region might be the source for the crack formation due to strain development, and further theoretical analysis is required in the future to verify this observation.

The experimental work was focused on processing flake graphite and ductile iron under various inoculationconditions {{in order to achieve}} various physicochemical states of the experimental melts. In addition, plates of various wall thicknesses, s were cast and the resultant eutectic cell or nodule counts were established.
