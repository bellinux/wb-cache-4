5|$|The list of Florida hurricanes from 2000 to {{the present}} {{has been marked by}} several devastating North Atlantic hurricanes; as of 2017, 79tropical or {{subtropical}} cyclones have affected the U.S. state of Florida. Collectively, cyclones in Florida during the time period resulted in more than $73billion in damage (2017USD). Additionally, tropical cyclones in Florida were responsible for 147direct fatalities and at least 92indirect casualties during the period. Eight cyclones affected the state in both 2004 and 2005, which were the years with the most tropical cyclones affecting the state.

The investigation stalls <b>until</b> <b>another</b> child, Danielle Barbakow (Lauren Diewold), mentions overhearing Wells being physically abused by Plott. Plott is arrested by Sherman, who she reprimands sternly, reminding him that she looked after him as a child too, and has never been accused of anything in three decades of childcare work. Sherman sees she is incapable of what she has been accused of and continues to send his son to the daycare, but other parents protest, to the point of picketing and vandalizing the fence around the daycare.|$|E

Dot is heartbroken when Sonia and Robbie inform her that Dave has died but is relieved when Dave shows up at the hospital alive.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} and most important surveyors of Kīlauea was James Dwight Dana, who, staying with the missionary Titus Coan, studied the island's volcanoes in detail for decades first-hand. Dana visited Kīlauea's summit and described it in detail in 1840. After publishing a summary paper in 1852, he directed a detailed geological study of the island in 1880 and 1881 but did not consider Kīlauea a separate volcano, instead referring {{to it as a}} flank vent of Mauna Loa; it was not <b>until</b> <b>another</b> geologist, C.

5|$|A beach party {{takes place}} at dusk on Amity Island, where a woman named Chrissie Watkins goes skinny dipping in the ocean. While {{treading}} water, she is violently pulled under. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. The medical examiner ruling the death a shark attack leads to Police Chief Martin Brody closing the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing it will ruin the town's summer economy. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Watkins {{was killed in a}} boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion <b>until</b> <b>another</b> fatal shark attack occurs shortly after. A bounty is then placed on the shark, resulting in an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Local professional shark hunter Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Watkins' remains and confirms her death was from a shark attack.|$|E

Chiaki and Isamu die before the Demi-fiend begins and give him their blessing in spirit form, while Hikawa accompanies the Demi-fiend into their new world. If Takao's wishes are followed, the Demi-fiend fights Kagutsuchi and the world is returned to its pre-Conception state, resurrecting and restoring all the main characters. If the Demi-fiend rejects Takao's wishes, Kagutsuchi curses him for allowing the world to die and departs, leaving the Demi-fiend as the only survivor in a barren world of demons, trapped as it is <b>until</b> <b>another</b> Conception can happen. If the Demi-fiend fulfills Lucifer's request of collecting the Candelabra from the Fiends, Kagutsuchi attacks him and is destroyed, breaking the Great Will's control over the worlds. After this, Lucifer fights the Demi-fiend to test his strength, then declares him to be the ultimate weapon in the upcoming war against the Great Will.|$|E

5|$|Just {{prior to}} the {{settlement}} of peace between the Uí Briain and the Norwegians, Muirchertach was not only contending {{with the arrival of}} Magnús, but was also locked in an extended struggle with Domnall Mac Lochlainn, King of Cenél nEógain (died 1121). The agreement of a year's peace between Muirchertach and Magnús, however, turned Magnús from an enemy into an ally. Whilst Magnús appears to have intended for Sigurðr to rule over his recently-won overseas territoriesa region stretching from Orkney to DublinMuirchertach appears to have intended to exert influence into the Isles through his new son-in-law. In fact, during the following year, Muirchertach and Magnús cooperated in military operations throughout Ireland. Unfortunately for Muirchertach, and his long-term ambitions in Ireland and the Isles, Magnús was slain in Ulster in 1103. Thereupon Morkinskinna and Fagrskinna reveal that Sigurðr immediately repudiated Bjaðmunjotheir marriage apparently having been unconsummatedand returned to Norway. There Sigurðr proceeded to share the Norwegian kingship with his two brothers, Eysteinn (died 1123) and Óláfr (died 1115).

5|$|One of {{the smaller}} ships from the convoy, an American {{merchant}} ship named Silenus, had separated from the main body in the storm and arrived at the Nicobar Islands. There she had encountered Caroline and the American captain had reported the location and value of the convoy to Féretier. Setting all sail, Féretier took Caroline to the north-west, and sighted the convoy at 05:30, {{only a few days}} after leaving the Nicobar Islands. The British ships, under the loose command of John Dale in Streatham, originally mistook the French frigate for the missing Victor and it was not <b>until</b> <b>another</b> half-hour had passed that Dale realised the danger his ships were in. Ordering the Indiamen to form a line of battle, Dale placed his ship in the centre, with the small Lord Keith ahead and Europe behind. However, the lack of naval experience on the British ships resulted in the Indiamen sailing too far from one another in line, thus leaving them unable to provide effective mutual support.|$|E
5|$|Samson, {{in earlier}} drafts also called Edgar Leiber or Edgar Leonhardt, is the dwarf {{co-manager}} of the Carnivàle. His original biography gave his {{background as a}} dwarf strongman who started his career in 1904. Eight years later, he started working on traveling carnivals, including the Hyde&Teller Company. Samson's wit elevated him from performer to general manager <b>until</b> <b>another</b> character, Management, purchased the carnival (to be renamed Carnivàle) and briefly gave Samson's job to Lodz, a blind mentalist. The beginning of the series shows Samson delegating Management's orders to the carnies. Samson temporarily loses his position to Lodz {{for a second time}} {{near the end of the}} first season but retains Management's trust. The death of Management in season 2 leads to Samson's secret deal with Ben to make the boy the new commander of the carnival.|$|E

5|$|The 1890 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season is {{tied for the}} third least active {{hurricane season}} on record, behind 1914 and 1930. The first system was initially observed on May27 and the last storm, Hurricane Four, dissipated over Central America on November1. These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. The first storm moved slowly north-northwestward, bringing heavy rains and extensive flooding to Cuba, which caused at least three fatalities and at least $1million (1890USD) in damage. It dissipated in the Gulf of Mexico on May29. Tropical cyclogenesis went dormant for nearly {{two and a half}} months, <b>until</b> <b>another</b> system was observed near the Windward Islands on August18. It traversed the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, grazing the Yucatan Peninsula and making landfall in Louisiana before dissipating on August28. Impact from the storm was minimal.|$|E
5|$|The station can be {{seen from}} the Earth with the naked eye and, as of , is the largest {{artificial}} satellite in Earth orbit with a mass and volume greater than that of any previous space station. The Soyuz spacecraft delivers crew members, stays docked for their half-year-long missions and then returns them home. Several uncrewed cargo spacecraft service the ISS, they are the Russian Progress spacecraft which has done so since 2000, the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) since 2008, the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) since 2009, the American Dragon spacecraft since 2012, and the American Cygnus spacecraft since 2013. The Space Shuttle, before its retirement, was also used for cargo transfer and would often switch out expedition crew members, although it did not have the capability to remain docked for the duration of their stay. <b>Until</b> <b>another</b> US manned spacecraft is ready, crew members will travel to and from the International Space Station exclusively aboard the Soyuz. The highest number of people occupying the ISS has been thirteen; this occurred three times during the late Shuttle ISS assembly missions.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 2000s the Caribous were {{becoming}} difficult to maintain, and {{were no longer}} capable of operating in war zones as they lacked electronic warfare systems {{and other forms of}} self-protection. As a result, it was decided in late 2008 to retire the aircraft and replace them with Beechcraft King Air 350s on an interim basis <b>until</b> <b>another</b> tactical transport entered service. The Caribous were gradually retired from May 2009, the last leaving service on 27 November that year when A4-140 was flown to Canberra and handed over to the Australian War Memorial for preservation. By the time the aircraft were retired, No. 38 Squadron had been operating Caribous for 45 years. Three King Air 350s were transferred to No. 38 Squadron from the Army's 173rd Surveillance Squadron on 20 November 2009, and deliveries of a further five newly built aircraft were completed in July 2010. At least one of the Army aircraft {{is believed to have been}} fitted with ground surveillance sensors, and this capacity was retained after it was transferred to the Air Force. No. 38 Squadron's King Airs were initially operated by Army personnel, who were given the choice of transferring to the RAAF or converting to helicopters at the end of their posting. The other No. 38 pilots were converted to the type at the Army's Oakey Army Aviation Centre, but the squadron began conducting its own conversion courses after the second batch of five aircraft were delivered.|$|E
