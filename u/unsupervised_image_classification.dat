40|$|Coastal {{erosion and}} land loss {{continue}} to threaten many {{areas in the}} United States. Landsat data {{has been used to}} monitor regional coastal change since the 1970 s. Many techniques can be used to produce coastal land water masks, including <b>image</b> <b>classification</b> and density slicing of individual bands or of band ratios. Band ratios used in land water detection include several variations of the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). This poster discusses a study that compares land water masks computed from <b>unsupervised</b> Landsat <b>image</b> <b>classification</b> with masks from density-sliced band ratios and from the Landsat TM band 5.

However, density sliced NDWI imagery from either near infrared (NIR) and blue bands or from NIR and green bands also produced more effective land water masks than imagery from the density-sliced Landsat TM band 5. NDWI based on NIR and green bands is noteworthy because it allows land water masks to be generated from multispectral satellite sensors without a blue band (e. g., ASTER and Landsat MSS).

40|$|In this dissertation, two nonlocal variational {{models for}} image and data {{processing}} are presented: nonlocal total variation (NLTV) for <b>unsupervised</b> hyperspectral <b>image</b> <b>classification,</b> and low dimensional manifold model (LDMM) for general image and data processing problems. Both models utilize the nonlocal patch-based structures in natural images and data, and modern optimization techniques {{are used to}} solve the corresponding variational problems. The proposed algorithms achieve state-of-the-art results on various image and data processing problems, in particular <b>unsupervised</b> hyperspectral <b>image</b> <b>classification</b> and <b>image</b> or data interpolation. First, a graph-based nonlocal total variation method is proposed for <b>unsupervised</b> <b>classification</b> of hyperspectral <b>images</b> (HSI). The variational problem is solved by the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm. By squaring the labeling function and using a stable simplex clustering routine, an unsupervised clustering method with random initialization can be implemented. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated on both synthetic and real-world HSI, and numerical {{results show that the}} proposed algorithm outperforms other standard unsupervised clustering methods such as spherical K-means, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), and the graph-based Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) scheme. Next, we present a novel low dimensional manifold model for general image processing problems. LDMM is {{based on the fact that}} the patch manifolds of many natural images have low dimensional structures. Based on this observation, the dimension of the patch manifold is used as a regularization to recover the image. The key step in LDMM is to solve a Laplace-Beltrami equation over a point cloud, and it is tackled by the point integral method (PIM). The point integral method enforces the sample point constraints correctly and yields better results than the standard graph Laplacian. LDMM can be used for various image processing problems, and it achieves state-of-the-art results for image inpainting from random subsampling. Lastly, we present an alternative way to solve the Laplace-Beltrami equation in LDMM. Although the point integral method correctly enforces the sample point constraints and achieves excellent results for image inpainting, the resulting linear system is on the patch domain, and hundreds of linear systems need to be solved each iteration. This causes LDMM to be computationally infeasible for large images and high dimensional data. An alternative way is to discretize the Laplace-Beltrami operator with the weighted graph Laplacian (WGL). After such discretization, we only need to solve one symmetric sparse linear system per iteration of manifold update for image inpainting. Moreover, semi-local patches that in- corporate coordinate information of the patches are used in the weight update, which leads to a faster convergence of LDMM. Numerical experiments on normal image, hyperspectral image, and high dimensional scientific data interpolation demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm...|$|R

30|$|A primary tool used to {{identify}} the LSMA sites on the satellite imagery was an on-screen digitizing technique based on the physiognomic attributes of objects and their spatial relationships or associations (Campbell 2006).

Also, the digitizing experience benefited from spatial relationships or associations of different natural and artificial objects such as water sources and road networks. Prior to use of this technique, both <b>unsupervised</b> and supervised <b>image</b> <b>classifications</b> were tried. Both <b>image</b> <b>classification</b> techniques provided indistinct boundaries of LSMA sites and spectral confusion - common in areas of sparse vegetation cover due to high background reflection from the soil, {{as is the case}} in Butana - led to mislabeling of land classes.

40|$|Thesis (MA (Geography and Environmental Studies)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. Salinisation {{is a major}} {{environmental}} hazard that reduces agricultural yields and degrades arable land. Two main categories of salinisation are: primary and secondary soil salinisation. While primary soil salinisation is caused by natural processes, secondary soil salinisation is caused by human factors. Incorrect irrigation practices are the major contributor to secondary soil salinisation. Because of low costs and less time {{that is associated with}} the use of remote sensing techniques, remote sensing data is used in this study to identify and map salinised irrigated land between Upington and Keimoes, Northern Cape Province, in South Africa. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of digital aerial imagery in identifying salinised cultivated land. Two methods were used to realize this aim. The first method involved visually identifying salinised areas on NIR, and NDVI images and then digitizing them onscreen. In the second method, digital RGB mosaicked, stacked, and NDVI images were subjected to <b>unsupervised</b> <b>image</b> <b>classification</b> to identify salinised land. Soil samples randomly selected and analyzed for salinity were used to validate the results obtained from the analysis of aerial photographs. Both techniques had difficulties in identifying salinised land because of their inability to differentiate salt induced stress from other forms of stress. Visual image analysis was relatively successful in identifying salinised land than <b>unsupervised</b> <b>image</b> <b>classification.</b> Visual image analysis correctly identified about 55 % of salinised land while only about 25 % was identified by unsupervised classification. The two techniques predict that an average of about 10 % of irrigated land is affected by salinisation in the study area. This study found that although visual analysis was time consuming and cannot differentiate salt induced stress from other forms; it is fairly possible to identify areas of crop stress using digital aerial imagery.
