25|$|On January 16, 2007, the NPP Senate Caucus imposed {{disciplinary}} {{sanctions on}} two more NPP senators, José Emilio González, Rosselló's fellow senator from the Arecibo district, and Carmelo Ríos Santiago of the Bayamón district. The two were the decisive {{votes to pass}} a Concurrent Resolution proposing a constitutional amendment that would turn Puerto Rico's bicameral legislature in a <b>unicameral</b> <b>system,</b> an issue not addressed by the party's platform. In total, during the term, the caucus disciplined eight of the 16 members elected to the Senate in 2004.|$|E
500|$|While {{there had}} been legislatures with more than two {{chambers}} (tricameral and tetracameral ones), nowadays there are only unicameral and bicameral ones. Additionally, there are also differences {{in the degree of}} bicameralism. Whereas Italy is considered as having [...] "perfect bicameralism", with both chambers being equal, most other bicameral systems restrict the upper house's powers to a certain extent. There is a slight trend towards unicameralism; some upper houses have seen their powers reduced or proposals to that end. Belgium's system has been reduced from a perfectly bicameral one to a nowadays de facto <b>unicameral</b> <b>system.</b> In 2009, Romania voted in favour of unicameralism, on a plebiscite, however the country still has a bicameral system, as of [...] On the other hand, Ireland narrowly voted against abolishing their upper house in 2013, and Italy voted not to reduce its Senate's powers in 2016.|$|E

50|$|In Argentina, eight provinces have {{bicameral}} legislatures, with a Senate and a Chamber of Deputies: Buenos Aires, Catamarca, Corrientes, Entre Ríos, Mendoza, Salta, San Luis (since 1987) and Santa Fe. Córdoba and Tucumán {{changed to}} <b>unicameral</b> <b>systems</b> in 2001 and 2003 respectively.|$|R
50|$|In some {{countries}} with federal systems, individual states (like {{those of the}} United States, Australia and a few States of India) may also have bicameral legislatures. Only three such states, Nebraska in the US, Queensland in Australia and Bavaria in Germany have later adopted <b>unicameral</b> <b>systems.</b> Brazilian states and Canadian provinces had all their upper houses abolished.|$|R
5000|$|A legislature, often bicameral, with {{at least}} one elected house [...] - [...] {{although}} <b>unicameral</b> <b>systems</b> also exist; legislative members are usually elected by district in first-past-the-post elections (as opposed to country-wide proportional representation). Exceptions to this include New Zealand, which changed in 1993 to use mixed-member proportional representation; Israel, which has always used country wide proportional representation; and Australia, which uses preferential voting.|$|R

50|$|Many jurisdictions, such as Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Hungary, Iceland, Iran, Mauritania, New Zealand, Peru, Sweden, Turkey, Venezuela {{and many}} Indian {{states as well}} as Brazilian states and Canadian provinces, once possessed upper houses but {{abolished}} them to adopt <b>unicameral</b> <b>systems.</b> Newfoundland had a Legislative Council prior to joining Canada, as did Ontario when it was Upper Canada and Quebec from 1791 (as Lower Canada) to 1968. Nebraska is the only state in the United States with a unicameral legislature, having abolished its lower house in 1934.|$|R
5|$|A further {{distinction}} {{is the number}} of chambers in the national legislature; <b>unicameral</b> <b>systems</b> with one chamber or bicameral ones with a lower house and an upper house. Federations and countries with strong regional differences or regional identities are normally bicameral, to reflect the regions' interests in national bills. The states with the larger populations, from the Netherlands upwards, all have a bicameral system. Although there is a greater mix among the smaller states (some influenced by their federalist structure), the smallest states are on the whole unicameral.|$|R
50|$|The German {{federal state}} of Bavaria had a {{bicameral}} legislature from 1946 to 1999, when the Senate was abolished by a referendum amending the state's constitution. The other 15 states {{have used a}} <b>unicameral</b> <b>system</b> since their founding.|$|E

50|$|As {{a leading}} Progressive Republican, Norris {{supported}} the direct election of senators. He also promoted {{the conversion of}} all state legislatures to the <b>unicameral</b> <b>system.</b> This was implemented in 1934 only in the Nebraska Legislature; all other states have retained a two-house system.|$|E
50|$|The main {{weakness}} of a <b>unicameral</b> <b>system</b> {{can be seen}} as the lack of restraint on the majority, particularly noticeable in parliamentary systems where the leaders of the parliamentary majority also dominate the executive. There is also the risk that important sectors of society may not be adequately represented.|$|E
50|$|The House of Federation has two {{committees}} and a Council of Constitutional Inquiry. Each committee consists of fifteen members including a chair person. The two committees are the Regional & Constitutional Affairs and Budget Subsidy & Revenue Affairs. With no legislative power.

5000|$|Modern {{democratic}} {{states with}} bicameral parliamentary systems are sometimes {{equipped with a}} senate, often distinguished from an ordinary parallel lower house, known variously as the “House of Representatives”, “House of Commons”, “Chamber of Deputies”, “National Assembly”, “Legislative Assembly”, or [...] "House of Assembly", by electoral rules. This may include minimum age required for voters and candidates, proportional or majoritarian or plurality system, and an electoral basis or collegium. Typically, the senate {{is referred to as}} the upper house and has a smaller membership than the lower house. In some federal states senates also exist at the subnational level. In the United States all states with the exception of Nebraska (whose legislature is a unicameral body called the “Legislature” but whose members refer to themselves as “senators”) have a state senate. There is also the US Senate at the federal level. Similarly in Argentina, in addition to the Senate at federal level, eight of the country's provinces, Buenos Aires, Catamarca, Corrientes, Entre Ríos, Mendoza, Salta, San Luis (since 1987) and Santa Fe, have bicameral legislatures with a Senate. Córdoba and Tucumán changed to <b>unicameral</b> <b>systems</b> in 2001 and 2003 respectively.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} years since its {{creation}} in post-independence India, the state of Andhra Pradesh worked under a <b>unicameral</b> parliamentary <b>system.</b> On December 5, 1956 the Andhra Pradesh Vidhana Sabha passed a resolution calling {{for the creation of}} an upper house, the Vidhan Parishad, to transition to a bicameral system. The Vidhan Parishad was formed officially on July 1, 1958 under article 168 of the Constitution of India. The first President of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad inaugurated the Vidhan Parishad on July 8.|$|R
25|$|On January 16, 2007, Rosselló led {{the party}} caucus in the Senate to a {{reprimand}} of two more NPP senators, fellow Arecibo senator José Emilio González and Bayamón senator Carmelo Ríos for voting {{in favor of}} a concurrent resolution proposing a constitutional amendment that would turn Puerto Rico's bicameral legislature into a <b>unicameral</b> legislative <b>system,</b> increasing the number of reprimanded caucus members to eight of the total of sixteen elected in 2004. Both González and Rios expressed their lack of concern over the reprimand and were handily renominated in the March 2008 primary and reelected in the November 2008 general election.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} {{advantage of}} a <b>unicameral</b> <b>system</b> is more efficient lawmaking, as the legislative process is much simpler {{and there is no}} possibility of deadlock. Proponents of unicameralism have also argued that it reduces costs, even if the number of legislators stay the same, since there are fewer institutions to maintain and support it.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1930s, the Legislature of the State of Nebraska {{was reduced}} from {{bicameral}} to unicameral with the 43 members that once comprised that state's Senate.

40|$|The study {{approaches}} the way Romanian bicameralism functions, considering both its strengths and weaknesses. In addition, the <b>unicameral</b> parliamentary <b>system</b> {{is presented in}} relation to the bicameral one. In the doctrine, there are several opinions according to which bicameralism is preferred to unicameralism, because the two Houses provide increased safety, as the concentration of legislative power in one place could be both dangerous and, often, unjustified. But the two Chambers should not be similar, as this would not serve their guaranteeing purpose. Furthermore, bicameralism consolidates the balance and solidity of democratic regimes, providing a better separation of powers...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{incentives}} to create obstructive committee systems under different constitutionally specified requirements for passing legislation. The Shapley value {{is used to}} measure the distribution of bargaining power in the legislature. If the legislature is bicameral or the president can veto, then each chamber of the legislature can increase its total bargaining power, {{at the expense of the}} other chamber or the president, by giving its committee chairmen the power to block legislation. This incentive to let committees act as gatekeepers with veto power can persist even when such power may cause some opportunities for beneficial legislation to be lost. This incentive is absent, however, in <b>unicameral</b> parliamentary <b>systems.</b> ...|$|R

Out of Nuskhuri came a secular alphabet called Mkhedruli, which is the unicase Georgian alphabet in use today.|$|E
500|$|The Reform of 1906 was a {{giant leap}} in the {{political}} and social liberalization of the common Finnish people; the Russian royal family was the most autocratic and conservative rulers in Europe. The Finns adopted a <b>unicameral</b> parliamentary <b>system</b> with all political rights for female citizens, increasing the number of voters from 126,000 to 1,273,000. This produced around 50% turnouts for the Social Democrats, but the Czar regained his authority after the crisis of 1905, and during the second period of Russification between 1908 and 1917 [...] neutralized the power of the Parliament. He dissolved it and ordered parliamentary elections almost annually between 1908–1916, and determined the composition of the Finnish Senate, which did not correlate with the assembly of the Parliament, prohibiting true parliamentarism.|$|R
50|$|The Nebraska House of Representatives was {{the lower}} house of the Nebraska Legislature from 1867 until 1936.

Beginning as a territorial lower house in 1854, it had 26 members; this number was raised to 39 members {{at the time of}} the first state constitution's promulgation in 1866, and the second state constitution in 1875 limited membership in the House at 100 members, a limit which would be filled by 1881.

Also the alternative of giving up the bicameral formula due to some arguments related to the simplification and the efficiency of the legislative procedure is explored. </p...|$|R
