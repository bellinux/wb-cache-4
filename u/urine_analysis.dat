25|$|On September 10, 2006, Barry {{was stopped}} by Secret Service Uniformed Division police {{officers}} after stopping at a green light and running a red light. According to a Secret Service spokesman, the police officers pulled over his car, smelled alcohol, and administered a field sobriety test. Barry was then taken to the U.S. Capitol Police station for a breathalyzer test. The Secret Service said that the breathalyzer test did not give an accurate reading, but Barry later said that it gave a successful reading of 0.02%, which {{is less than the}} legal limit of 0.08%. The police officers asked Barry to give a <b>urine</b> <b>analysis,</b> which Barry refused. The officers gave Barry a ticket for running a red light and failing to submit to a <b>urine</b> <b>analysis.</b> He was also charged with driving an unregistered vehicle and misuse of temporary tags. Barry pleaded not guilty to the charges. Prosecutors offered Barry a deal to drop the charge of driving under the influence in exchange for a guilty plea from Barry; he declined. A judge found him not guilty of the charges.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBackgroundThere is an {{unresolved}} {{debate on}} the best screening method for hematuria as a symptom of glomerulonephritis or urological malignancies. The urinary dipstick is generally considered as an imperfect surrogate for <b>urine</b> microscopy <b>analysis.</b> ResultsWe designed a study to compare <b>urine</b> microscopy <b>analysis,</b> urinary dipstick and flow cytometry, using controlled dilutions of blood in urine samples from volunteers collected in two different physiologically-relevant conditions (basal state and hyperhydration). We found that although all techniques were 100 % effective in detecting hematuria at basal state, these results were variably reproduced when testing the same final amount of hematuria in urine collected after hyperhydration. Our data shows a variable sensitivity {{for the detection of}} hematuria by <b>urine</b> microscopy <b>analysis</b> or flow cytometry, but not by urinary dipstick. ConclusionsUrinary dipstick qualifies as a better screening test for hematuria than <b>urine</b> microscopy <b>analysis</b> or flow cytometry, as it is sensitive and performs better in unstandardized conditions. It is universally available and also faster and cheaper than cytometric techniques...|$|R

25|$|Diagnostic {{testing for}} OTC deficiency, or any {{individual}} with hyperammonemia involves plasma and <b>urine</b> amino acid <b>analysis,</b> <b>urine</b> organic acid <b>analysis</b> (to identify {{the presence or}} absence of orotic acid, as well as rule out an organic acidemia) and plasma acylcarnitines (will be normal in OTC deficiency, but can identify some other causes of hyperammonemia). An individual with untreated OTC deficiency will show decreased citrulline and arginine concentrations (because the enzyme block is proximal to these intermediates) and increased orotic acid. The increased orotic acid concentrations result from the buildup of carbamoyl phosphate. This biochemical phenotype (increased ammonia, low citrulline and increased orotic acid) is classic for OTC deficiency, but can also be seen in neonatal presentations of ornithine aminotransferase deficiency. Only severely affected males consistently demonstrate this classic biochemical phenotype.|$|R

Our {{aim is to}} evaluate the reliability (sensitivity) of <b>urine</b> dipstick <b>analysis</b> against <b>urine</b> culture in the diagnosis of UTI. Materials and Methods: Patients admitted to our hospital suspected of having UTI, with positive urine cultures were {{included in this study}} from a 2 -year period (January 2011 to December 2012). Dipstick urinalysis was done using multistix 10 SG (Siemens) and clinitek advantus analyzer. The sensitivity of dipstick nitrites, leukocyte esterase and blood in these culture-positive UTI patients was calculated retrospectively. Results: <b>Urine</b> dipstick <b>analysis</b> of 635 <b>urine</b> culture-positive patients was studied. The sensitivity of nitrite alone and leukocyte esterase alone were 23. 31 % and 48. 5 %, respectively. The sensitivity of blood alone in positive urine culture was 63. 94 %, which was the highest sensitivity for a single screening test. The presence of leukocyte esterase and/or blood increased the sensitivity to 72. 28 %. The sensitivity was found to be the highest when nitrite, leukocyte and blood were considered together. Conclusions: Nitrite test and leukocyte esterase test when used individually is not reliable to rule out UTI.

40|$|Renal cell {{carcinoma}} (RCC) accounts for 11, 000 deaths {{per year in}} the United States. When detected early, generally serendipitously by imaging conducted for other reasons, long term survival is generally excellent. When detected with symptoms, prognosis is poor. Under these circumstances, a screening biomarker has the potential for substantial public health benefit. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the utility of <b>urine</b> metabolomics <b>analysis</b> for metabolomic profiling, identification of biomarkers, and ultimately for devising a urine screening test for RCC. Fifty urine samples were obtained from RCC and control patients from two institutions, and in a separate study, urine samples were taken from 13 normal individuals. Hydrophilic interaction chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed to identify small molecule metabolites present in each sample. Cluster analysis, principal components analysis, linear discriminant analysis, differential analysis, and variance component analysis were used to analyze the data. Previous work is extended to confirm the effectiveness of <b>urine</b> metabolomics <b>analysis</b> using a larger and more diverse patient cohort. It is now shown that the utility of this technique is dependent on the site of urine collection and that there exist substantial sources of variation of the urinary metabolomic profile, although group variation is sufficient to yield viable biomarkers. Surprisingly there is a small degree of variation in the urinary metabolomic profile in normal patients due to time since the last meal, and there is little difference in the urinary metabolomic profile in a cohort of pre- and postnephrectomy (partial or radical) renal {{cell carcinoma}} patients, suggesting that metabolic changes associated with RCC persist after removal of the primary tumor. After further investigations relating to the discovery and identity of individual biomarkers and attenuation of residual sources of variation, our work shows that <b>urine</b> metabolomics <b>analysis</b> has potential to lead to a diagnostic assay for RCC...|$|R
