Therefore the main aim of this project was to design a novel UPS system using self contained multiple energy storage elements to transfer energy between input and output and thereby completely electrically isolating the load from the main power supply. The system was to comply with the IEEE C 62. 41 Class B standard and provide sufficient common and normal mode surge protection. Supercapacitors have been used as the main energy storage element for this project and an Atmel Mega 64 microcontroller has been chosen to provide control to guarantee proper functionality. This report outlines the main aspects of the proposed design and the individual modules involved, and discusses possible design solutions considered to implement the required control.

Moreover, the suitability of Distortion minimization PWM for this inverter design is discussed compared to Selective Harmonic Elimination PWM (SHEPWM) : {{one of the most}} popular PWM methods for multi-level inverters.

40|$|Since the {{electricity}} bill of a data center constitutes {{a significant portion}} of its overall operational costs, reducing this has become important. We investigate cost reduction opportunities that arise by the use of <b>uninterrupted</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (<b>UPS)</b> units as energy storage devices. This represents a deviation from the usual use of these devices as mere transitional fail-over mechanisms between utility and captive sources such as diesel generators. We consider the problem of opportunistically using these devices to reduce the time average electric utility bill in a data center. Using the technique of Lyapunov optimization, we develop an online control algorithm that can optimally exploit these devices to minimize the time average cost. This algorithm operates without any knowledge of the statistics of the workload or electricity cost processes, making it attractive in the presence of workload and pricing uncertainties. An interesting feature of our algorithm is that its deviation from optimality reduces as the storage capacity is increased. Our work opens up a new area in data center power management.

One first advantage of the proposed solution is the reduced voltage stress across the active switches that is lower than half of the output voltage, what allows the use of MOSFETs with lower drain-to-source resistance. Moreover, by employing the three-state switching cell, the size of the inductor is reduced because the operating frequency of the inductor is double of the switching frequency. The current share between the active switches allows further reduction of the conduction losses.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Uninterrupted</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (<b>UPS)</b> sits {{between a}} power supply such as wall outlet and devices to prevent {{undesired}} feature that can occur within the power source such as outages, sags, surges and bad harmonics from the supply to avoid {{a negative impact on}} the devices. This paper presents a photovoltaic (PV) powered UPS using microcontroller PIC 16 F 628 A-I/P. It is a standby UPS whereas if the main power source fails to supply power to loads, a battery powered inverter turns on to continue supplying power. The battery is charged by the PV using solar charger and transfer switch controlled by the microcontroller. In this research, AC three-level waveform single phase inverter was developed and created by a microcontroller PIC 16 F 627 A-I/P with varied maximum voltage angle from 200 to 1800 and tested to a load of 240 V, 20 W AC aquarium water pump, and also analyzed effect of maximum voltage angle on the three-level single phase inverter performance. The result showed that maximum voltage angles of the inverter effected on root mean square value of AC voltage, current and power. If the maximum voltage angle was increased, therefore value of the AC voltage, current and power would increase. The maximum voltage angle would effect on the current total harmonic distortion (CTHD), the lowest CTHD of 15. 448 % was obtained when the maximum voltage angle was 1340...|$|E

A disturbance in the electrical supply lasting just a few milliseconds can affect thousands or millions of basic operations.

That is why many loads, called sensitive or critical loads, require a supply that is protected.
