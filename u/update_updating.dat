Dragons of Autumn, subtitled [...] "Dragonlance War of the Lance Campaign, Volume One", {{requires the use of}} the Dragonlance Campaign Setting and the War of the Lance Sourcebook. It is a 176-page softcover book by Clark Valentine and Sean Macdonald based on the original modules. The four chapters Despair, Flame, Hope and Desolation each correspond to the relevant DL1-4 Dragons of ... module. The maps have been redrawn and though the plot follows closely to the originals some changes have been made to keep old players on their toes.|$|E

Integrity constraints must either be preserved in the unnecessary intermediate states or else deferred. Multiple assignment accepts updates across the entire database simultaneously and makes the system responsible for scheduling them correctly. We outline implementation techniques that potentially permit multiple assignment to outperform SQL deferred constraint checking by employing parallelism and multi-query optimization...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Subspace {{estimation}} {{and tracking}} are of fundamental importance in many signal processing algorithms. The class of “Schur subspace estimators ” provides a complete parametrization of all “principal subspace estimates, ” {{defined as the}} column spans of corresponding low-rank matrix approximants that lie within a specified 2 -norm distance of a given matrix. The parametrization isfoundintermsofatwo-sidedhyperbolic decomposition (HyperbolicURV,orHURV),whichcanbecomputedusinghyperbolic rotations. Unfortunately, such rotations are commonly associated with numerical instabilities. In this paper, we present a numerically stable, non-iterative algorithm to compute the HURV, called the Signed URV (SURV) algorithm. We show that this algorithm implicitly imposes certain constraints on the HURV such that important norm bounds that guarantee stability are satisfied. The constraints also restrict the parametrization of the subspace estimate such that it becomes close to the principal subspace provided by the SVD (which is a special case within this class). The complexity of the algorithm is of the same order {{as that of a}} QR <b>update.</b> <b>Updating</b> and downdating are of the same complexity and are both numerically stable. SURV is proven to provide rank estimates consistent with the SVD with the same rank threshold. It can replace an SVD where only subspace estimation is needed. Typical applications would e. g. be the detection of the number of signals in array signal processing, and subspace estimation for source separation and interference mitigation, such as the firststepinMUSICandESPRIT-type algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate the numerical stability and confirm that this algorithm provides exact rank estimates and good principal subspace estimates as compared to the SVD.

The task of consistency restoration is also realized as special cases of these <b>updates.</b> Each <b>update</b> problem is comparatively assessed from the computational complexity viewpoint.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{techniques for}} <b>updating</b> knowledge bases represented in extended logic programs. Three di#erent types of <b>updates,</b> view <b>updates,</b> theory <b>updates,</b> and inconsistency removal, are considered. We formulate these <b>updates</b> through abduction, and provide methods for computing them with <b>update</b> programs. An <b>update</b> program is an extended logic program which specifies changes on abductive hypotheses, then <b>updates</b> are computed by the U-minimal answer sets of an <b>update</b> program. The proposed technique provides a uniform framework for these di#erent types of <b>updates,</b> and each <b>update</b> is computed using existing procedures of logic programming. 1 Introduction A knowledge base must be <b>updated</b> when new information arrives.
