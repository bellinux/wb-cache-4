5|$|At {{present in}} the United States there are three {{different}} levels of scrutiny. Firstly, if a law categorizes {{on the basis of}} race or national origin (which are regarded as suspect classifications), or infringes a fundamental right, strict scrutiny is applied. Accordingly, the law is unconstitutional <b>unless</b> <b>it</b> is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. In addition, there should not be a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that compelling interest. Secondly, if the law categorizes on the basis of gender, legitimacy or similar quasi-suspect classifications, intermediate scrutiny is applied – the law is unconstitutional <b>unless</b> <b>it</b> is substantially related to an important government interest. Finally, the traditional rational basis review is applied if the law categorizes on some other, non-suspect, basis. In this case, the law is constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} {{exists between}} BAA and West Sussex County Council preventing {{the building of}} a second runway before 2019. Nevertheless, consultations were launched in 2002 by the Department for Transport, at which proposals for additional facilities and runways were considered.

5|$|As {{champions of}} the Atlantic Coast Conference, Virginia Tech was awarded an {{automatic}} bid to the Orange Bowl game. The automatic ACC bid {{was the result of}} an off-season deal following the inaugural ACC Championship Game which granted the winner of the ACC Championship Game an automatic bid to the Orange Bowl <b>unless</b> <b>it</b> was ranked high enough in the Bowl Championship Series standings to play in the National Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{only two}} players left from the {{championship}} team, McNamara and Syracuse struggled through the 2005–2006 regular season. Two highlights were the 38 points McNamara scored against Davidson College, the second-most points ever scored by a Syracuse player at the team's home arena, the Carrier Dome, and a 30-point performance against the visiting Louisville Cardinals. Syracuse finished with a losing record in the Big East; the team was in danger of missing the NCAA Tournament <b>unless</b> <b>it</b> secured the conference's automatic bid by winning the Big East's postseason tournament.|$|E

5|$|Germany invaded Poland in {{the early}} morning of 1 September 1939. The British Cabinet met late that morning and issued a warning to Germany that <b>unless</b> <b>it</b> withdrew from Polish {{territory}} Britain would carry out its obligations to Poland. When the House of Commons met at 6:00pm, Chamberlain and Labour deputy leader Arthur Greenwood (deputising for the sick Clement Attlee) entered the chamber to loud cheers. Chamberlain spoke emotionally, laying the blame for the conflict on Hitler.|$|E

5|$|Sanjeev Kapoor, an {{entrepreneur}} of Indian cuisine, mentions {{in his book}} Royal Hyderabadi Cooking that the preparation of haleem in Hyderabad has become an art form, much like the Hyderabadi biryani. In 2010 Hyderabadi haleem was awarded Geographical Indication status by the Indian GI registry office. It became the first meat product of India to receive a GI certification, This means that a dish cannot be sold as Hyderabadi haleem <b>unless</b> <b>it</b> meets the necessary standards laid down for it.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the race}} was {{abandoned}} after twelve total laps, it did not reach official status; IndyCar does not consider a race official <b>unless</b> <b>it</b> reaches the halfway mark. As such, no points were awarded and the series championship went to Franchitti by default. If the race had continued and reached official status, Franchitti {{would have been the}} series champion anyway as he had avoided the accident. Power's car, meanwhile, was heavily damaged in the lap 11 crash {{to the point where he}} would not have been able to continue racing.|$|E

5|$|The {{borders of}} Albania again became {{the cause of}} {{international}} conflict when Italian General Enrico Tellini and four of his assistants were ambushed and killed on 24 August 1923 while marking out the newly decided border between Greece and Albania. Italian leader Benito Mussolini was incensed, and demanded that a commission investigate the incident within five days. Whatever {{the results of the}} investigation, Mussolini insisted that the Greek government pay Italy fifty million lire in reparations. The Greeks said they would not pay <b>unless</b> <b>it</b> was proved that the crime was committed by Greeks.|$|E
