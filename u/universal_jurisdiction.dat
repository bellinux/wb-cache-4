25|$|The moral philosopher Peter Singer, {{along with}} Kenneth Roth, has cited Israel's {{prosecution}} of Adolf Eichmann in 1961 as an assertion of <b>universal</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> He claims that while Israel did invoke a statute specific to Nazi crimes against Jews, its Supreme Court claimed <b>universal</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over crimes against humanity.|$|E
25|$|Kenneth Roth, the {{executive}} director of Human Rights Watch, argues that <b>universal</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> allowed Israel to try Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem in 1961. Roth also argues that clauses in treaties such as the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the United Nations Convention Against Torture of 1984, which requires signatory states to pass municipal laws that are based on the concept of <b>universal</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> indicate widespread international acceptance of the concept.|$|E
25|$|Confronted {{with this}} sharp {{increase}} in cases, Belgium established the condition that the accused person must be Belgian or present in Belgium. An arrest warrant issued in 2000 under this law, against the then Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was challenged before the International Court of Justice in the case entitled ICJ Arrest Warrant Case. The ICJ's decision issued on 14 February 2002 found {{that it did not}} have jurisdiction to consider the question of <b>universal</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> instead deciding the question on the basis of immunity of high-ranking state officials. However, the matter was addressed in separate and dissenting opinions, such as that of President Guillaume who concluded that <b>universal</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> exists only in relation to piracy; and the dissenting opinion of Judge Oda who recognised piracy, hijacking, terrorism and genocide as crimes subject to <b>universal</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Catholic Church in Namibia {{is part of}} the Roman Catholic Church {{under the}} <b>universal,</b> direct <b>jurisdiction</b> of the supreme Vicar of Christ, the Bishop of Rome and the Catholic world, and {{absolute}} monarch of the Vatican City state, the Pope.|$|R
25|$|The {{doctrine}} of papal primacy was further developed in 1870 at the First Vatican Council, where ultramontanism achieved victory over conciliarism with the pronouncement of papal infallibility (the {{ability of the}} pope to define dogmas free from error ex cathedra) and of papal supremacy, i.e., supreme, full, immediate, and <b>universal</b> ordinary <b>jurisdiction</b> of the pope.|$|R
25|$|The High Court of Australia {{confirmed}} {{the authority of}} the Australian Parliament, under the Australian Constitution, to exercise <b>universal</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over war crimes in the Polyukhovich v Commonwealth case of 1991.|$|E
25|$|On November 14, 2006, invoking <b>universal</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> legal {{proceedings}} were started in Germany against Gonzales for his alleged involvement {{under the command}} responsibility of prisoner abuse by writing the controversial legal opinions.|$|E
25|$|Category D— {{initially}} applicable only to such crimes as {{genocide and}} crimes against humanity— specifically omits provisions restricting its scope to Australian citizens, and therefore applies to any person in any country, giving Australia <b>universal</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over {{the crime of}} sedition.|$|E
50|$|Most jurisdictions {{below the}} state level in the United States impose a tax on {{interests}} in real property (land, buildings, and permanent improvements) that are considered under state law to be ownership interests. Rules vary widely by jurisdiction. However, certain features are nearly <b>universal.</b> Some <b>jurisdictions</b> also tax some types of business personal property, particularly inventory and equipment. States generally do not impose property taxes.|$|R
50|$|Throughout his {{activities}} as {{professor of law}} and member of various judicial bodies, Alfaro promoted the notion of <b>universal</b> criminal <b>jurisdiction</b> and government accountability at all levels. An example to that effect can be seen in that during the deliberations on the law of treaties at the ILC, he opposed the notion that an international agreement reached by exchange of notes did not require ratification by the state legislature of the contracting states.|$|R
50|$|The {{establishment}} of a constitutional monarchy in 1834 granted limited religious toleration to non-Roman Catholics, and consequently led {{to the opening of}} an Anglican chapel in Lisbon. A second chapel was opened in 1868. The Anglican mission coincided with the growing influence of the Old Catholic movement in Portugal. Congregations were created from Catholic priests and laypeople who refused to accept the dogmas of the infallibility and <b>universal</b> ordinary <b>jurisdiction</b> of the Pope, as defined by the First Vatican Council in 1870.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} the United Nations {{has set up}} geographically specific {{courts to}} investigate and prosecute crimes against humanity under a theory of <b>universal</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> such as the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (1994), and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (1993).|$|E
25|$|The {{significance}} of Leo's pontificate lies in his assertion of the <b>universal</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of the Roman bishop, {{as expressed in}} his letters, and still more in his 96 extant orations. This assertion is {{commonly referred to as}} the doctrine of Petrine supremacy.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} <b>universal</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> is {{therefore}} {{closely linked to}} the idea that some international norms are erga omnes, or owed to the entire world community, as well as the concept of jus cogens – that certain international law obligations are binding on all states.|$|E
2500|$|The {{doctrine}} of papal primacy was further developed in 1870 at the First Vatican Council, which declared that [...] "in {{the disposition of}} God the Roman church holds the preeminence of ordinary power over all the other churches". This council also affirmed the dogma of papal infallibility, (declaring that the infallibility of the Christian community extends to the pope himself, when he defines a doctrine concerning faith or morals to be held by the whole Church), and of papal supremacy (supreme, full, immediate, and <b>universal</b> ordinary <b>jurisdiction</b> of the pope).|$|R
40|$|Today at least, it is {{generally}} recognized that genocide is a crimen contra omnes, a crime under customary international law over which there is <b>universal</b> enforcement <b>jurisdiction</b> and responsibility. Indeed, it is commonly expected that the prohibition of genocide is a peremptory norm of customary international law, a jus cogens allowing no form of derogation under domestic or treaty-based law. It is also commonly understood that the definition of genocide contained in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide defines that which is prohibited by customary jus cogens...|$|R
5000|$|Gallicanism is a {{group of}} {{religious}} opinions that was for some time peculiar to the Church in France. These opinions were in opposition to the ideas which were called ultramontane, which means [...] "across the mountains" [...] (the Alps). Ultramontanism affirmed the authority of the Pope over the temporal kingdoms of the rest of Europe, particularly emphasizing a supreme episcopate for the Bishop of Rome holding <b>universal</b> immediate <b>jurisdiction.</b> This eventually led to the definition by the Roman Catholic Church of the dogma of Papal Infallibility at the First Vatican Council.|$|R
25|$|In November 2011, the Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission purportedly {{exercised}} <b>universal</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> {{to try and}} convict {{in absentia}} former US President George W. Bush and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair for the invasion of Iraq. In May 2012, the tribunal again under a purported exercise of <b>universal</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> took testimony from victims of torture at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, and convicted in absentia former President Bush, former Vice President Dick Cheney, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, former Deputy Assistant Attorneys General John Yoo and Jay Bybee, former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, and former counselors David Addington and William Haynes II for conspiracy to commit war crimes. The tribunal referred their findings to the chief prosecutor at the International Court of Justice in The Hague.|$|E
25|$|Because of <b>universal</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> {{action can}} be taken against pirates without {{objection}} from the flag state of the pirate vessel. This represents {{an exception to the}} principle extra territorium jus dicenti impune non paretur ("One who exercises jurisdiction out of his territory is not obeyed with impunity").|$|E
25|$|<b>Universal</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> may be {{asserted}} by {{a particular}} nation {{as well as by}} an international tribunal. The result is the same: individuals become answerable for crimes defined and prosecuted regardless of where they live, or where the conduct occurred; crimes said to be so grievous as to be universally condemned.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, Scottish lords had {{inherited}} regalities {{and had been}} able to judge in civil and criminal cases among their dependants. The Act {{put an end to this}} by extending <b>universal</b> royal <b>jurisdiction</b> throughout Scotland. The powers previously possessed by Scottish lords were transferred to sheriffs appointed by the King and the hereditary justiciarship of Scotland, held by the family of Argyll, was to be purchased and transferred to the High Court and Circuit-courts of Justiciary. Parliament granted £152,000 for the purchase of heritable jurisdictions. The Prime Minister Henry Pelham considered this the most important measure in dealing with Jacobitism in Scotland.|$|R

Congregations were created from Roman Catholic priests and laypeople who refused to accept the dogmas of the infallibility and <b>universal</b> ordinary <b>jurisdiction</b> of the Pope, as defined by the First Vatican Council in 1870. The Lusitanian Catholic Apostolic Evangelical Church was formed as a result in 1880, however laws still restricted the activities of non-Roman Catholics.|$|R
25|$|According to Amnesty International, {{a proponent}} of <b>universal</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> certain crimes pose so serious {{a threat to the}} {{international}} community as a whole that states have a logical and moral duty to prosecute an individual responsible; therefore, no place should be a safe haven for those who have committed genocide, crimes against humanity, extrajudicial executions, war crimes, torture and forced disappearances.|$|E
25|$|Ships sailing {{the high}} seas are {{generally}} {{under the jurisdiction of}} the flag state (in case of the Arctic Sea, Malta). However, according to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, piracy is a <b>universal</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> crime so that persons arrested for piracy while in international waters are tried according to the laws of the arresting country: Russia, in this case.|$|E
25|$|Piracy is of note in {{international}} law as it is commonly held to represent the earliest invocation {{of the concept of}} <b>universal</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> The crime of piracy is considered a breach of jus cogens, a conventional peremptory international norm that states must uphold. Those committing thefts on the high seas, inhibiting trade, and endangering maritime communication are considered by sovereign states to be hostis humani generis (enemies of humanity).|$|E
40|$|The global {{action against}} climate {{change has been}} largely ineffective. In view of this, peoples and nations that are most {{vulnerable}} to the ravages of climate change (e. g., small island states) may have to develop new strategies to combat the phenomenon. Indeed, some peoples and communities already bearing the brunt of climate change are resorting to self-help measures including litigation. I argue that the doctrine of <b>universal</b> civil <b>jurisdiction</b> could be the new dynamic {{in the quest for}} international climate justice. I examine how it could potentially help small island states, and other low-lying coastal states, to hold polluting corporations liable for their contributions to climate change...|$|R
50|$|Other {{traditional}} Christian churches (Assyrian Church of the East, the Oriental Orthodox Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Old Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, the Independent Catholic churches, etc.) {{accept the}} doctrine of Apostolic succession and, to varying extents, papal claims to a primacy of honour while generally rejecting that the pope is the successor to Peter in any unique sense not true of any other bishop. Primacy {{is regarded as a}} consequence of the pope's position as bishop of the original capital city of the Roman Empire, a definition explicitly spelled out in the 28th canon of the Council of Chalcedon. These churches see no foundation to papal claims of <b>universal</b> immediate <b>jurisdiction,</b> or to claims of papal infallibility. Several of these churches refer to such claims as ultramontanism.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a philosophical {{critique of the}} principles that currently govern extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction under public international law. I start by outlining an interest-based justification {{for the right to}} punish offenders which, I suggest, is sensitive to the territorial dimension of the criminal law. On its basis, I argue that the nationality and passive personality principles have hollow foundations; by contrast, this justification fully explains what makes the territoriality and protective principles morally sound. Finally, this paper takes issue with the two most influential justifications for legal punishment available in the literature, i. e., retribution and deterrence. It argues that when pressed against the issue of extraterritoriality, they are committed to conferring upon states <b>universal</b> criminal <b>jurisdiction</b> for municipal offences. Although this does not prove them wrong, it is an implication that few of their supporters would be happy to endorse...|$|R
25|$|Eichmann's {{defense lawyer}} argued that Israel {{did not have}} {{jurisdiction}} on account of Israel not having come into existence until 1948. The Genocide Convention also did not come into effect until 1951, and the Genocide Convention does not automatically provide for <b>universal</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> It is also argued that Israeli agents obtained Eichmann illegally, violating international law when they seized and kidnapped Eichmann, and brought him to Israel to stand trial. The Argentinian government settled the dispute diplomatically with Israel.|$|E
25|$|At {{about the}} same time, {{international}} law came to recognize the analogous concept of hostes humani generis ("enemies of the human race"): pirates, hijackers, and similar outlaws whose crimes were typically committed outside the territory of any state. The notion that heads of state and senior public officials should be treated like pirates or outlaws before the global bar of justice is, according to Henry Kissinger, a new gloss on this old concept. From these premises, representing the Enlightenment belief in trans-territorial, trans-cultural standards of right and wrong, derives <b>universal</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b>|$|E
25|$|On November 14, 2006, legal {{proceedings}} invoking <b>universal</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> were begun in Germany against Donald Rumsfeld, Alberto Gonzales, John Yoo, George Tenet {{and others for}} their alleged involvement in prisoner abuse under the command responsibility. On April 27, 2007, the German federal prosecutor announced {{that the government would}} not pursue charges against Rumsfeld and the 11 other U.S. officials, stating the accusations did not apply, in part because there was insufficient evidence that the acts occurred on German soil, and because the accused did not live in Germany.|$|E
5000|$|Within the Roman Catholic Church, ultramontanism {{achieved}} {{victory over}} conciliarism at the First Vatican Council, convened by Pope Pius IX in 1870, with the pronouncement of papal infallibility (the {{ability of the}} pope to define dogmas free from error ex cathedra) and of papal supremacy, i.e. supreme, full, immediate, and <b>universal</b> ordinary <b>jurisdiction</b> of the pope. Other Christian groups outside the Catholic Church declared this as the triumph of what they termed [...] "the heresy of ultramontanism". It was specifically decried in the Declaration of the Catholic Congress at Munich, in the Theses of Bonn, and in the Declaration of Utrecht, which became the foundational documents of Old Catholics (Altkatholische) who split with Rome over the declaration on infallibility and supremacy, joining the Old Episcopal Order Catholic See of Utrecht, which had been independent from Rome since 1723.|$|R
2500|$|There is no {{certainty}} {{about what}} the three crowns of the Triple Tiara symbolise, as {{is evident from the}} multitude of interpretations that have been and still are proposed. Some link it to the threefold authority of the [...] "Supreme Pontiff: Universal Pastor (top), <b>Universal</b> Ecclesiastical <b>Jurisdiction</b> (middle) and Temporal Power (bottom)". Others interpret the three tiers as meaning [...] "father of princes and kings, ruler of the world, vicar of Christ". The words that were used when popes were crowned were: Accipe tiaram tribus coronis ornatam, et scias te esse patrem principum et regum, rectorem orbis in terra vicarium Salvatoris nostri Jesu Christi, cui est honor et gloria in saecula saeculorum ("Receive the tiara adorned with three crowns and know that thou art father of princes and kings, ruler of the world, vicar on earth of our Saviour Jesus Christ, to whom is honour and glory for ever and ever").|$|R
40|$|This recension aims {{to expose}} {{in general terms}} the theory {{formulated}} by de Professor Alejandro Chehtman about {{the base of the}} <b>universal</b> and international <b>jurisdiction</b> over the international crimes. At the same time, it presents some respectful critics to the Chehtman’s tesis, particularly about the arguments that conduce him to reject the Luban’s tesis regarding the quid of the crimes against humanity. Finally it exposes some considerations about the utility of the Chehtman’s theory in a transitional justice process, like the one that is taking place in Colombia...|$|R
