40|$|Seventy {{percent of}} the world's urban {{population}} breathes <b>unsafe</b> <b>air.</b> From 300, 000 to 700, 000 people die each year as a result, many in developing countries. Expenditures to improve air quality compete with demands for other social needs, such as housing, education, medical care, nutrition, sanitation, and safe drinking water. Programs to provide these needs are viewed as producing goods while air quality policies are seen as ameliorating a bad. However, it is more appropriate to think about air quality as another good that must be produced as a joint product of other processes. From this perspective, policies to improve air quality have a broader scope than do either traditional regulations and standards or incentive based programs. This paper places air quality policy choices {{in the context of}} healthier air as a product, explicitly recognizing its public good characteristics and the lack of close private substitutes.

It is hoped that analysis of these data can lead to greater acceptance in the developing world. CDC is also implementing field investigations and supporting program implementation and evaluation to help the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves promote clean and safe cooking.

However, the under- 5 mortality rate in Ethiopia is still higher than the under- 5 mortality rates of several low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). On the other hand, the patterns and causes of child mortality have not been well investigated in Ethiopia. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the mortality trend, causes of death, and risk factors among children under 5 in Ethiopia during 1990 – 2013. Methods We used Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 data. Spatiotemporal Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) was applied to generate best estimates of child mortality with 95 % uncertainty intervals (UI). Causes of death by age groups, sex, and year were measured using Cause of Death Ensemble modeling (CODEm). For estimation of HIV/AIDS mortality rate, the modified UNAIDS EPP-SPECTRUM suite model was used. Results Between 1990 and 2013 the under- 5 mortality rate declined from 203. 9 deaths/ 1000 live births to 74. 4 deaths/ 1000 live births with an annual rate of change of 4. 6 %, yielding a total reduction of 64 %. Similarly, child (1 – 4 years), post-neonatal, and neonatal mortality rates declined by 75 %, 64 %, and 52 %, respectively, between 1990 and 2013. Lower respiratory tract infection (LRI), diarrheal diseases, and neonatal syndromes (preterm birth complications, neonatal encephalopathy, neonatal sepsis, and other neonatal disorders) accounted for 54 % of the total under- 5 deaths in 2013. Under- 5 mortality rates due to measles, diarrhea, malaria, protein-energy malnutrition, and iron-deficiency anemia declined by more than two-thirds between 1990 and 2013. Among the causes of under- 5 deaths, neonatal syndromes such as sepsis, preterm birth complications, and birth asphyxia ranked third to fifth in 2013. Of all risk-attributable deaths in 1990, 25 % of the total under- 5 deaths (112, 288 / 435, 962) and 48 % (112, 288 / 232, 199) of the deaths due to diarrhea, LRI, and other common infections were attributable to childhood wasting. Similarly, 19 % (43, 759 / 229, 333) of the total under- 5 deaths and 45 % (43, 759 / 97, 963) of the deaths due to diarrhea and LRI were attributable to wasting in 2013.

By providing national and subnational assessments spanning the past 25 years, this study can inform debates {{on the importance of}} addressing risks in context. MethodsWe used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for previous iterations of the Global Burden of Disease Study to estimate attributable deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and trends in exposure by age group, sex, year, and geography for 79 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks from 1990 to 2015. This study included 388 risk-outcome pairs that met World Cancer Research Fund-defined criteria for convincing or probable evidence. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. We developed a metric that allows comparisons of exposure across risk factors—the summary exposure value. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk level, we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We decomposed trends in attributable burden into contributions from population growth, population age structure, risk exposure, and risk-deleted cause-specific DALY rates. We characterised risk exposure in relation to a Socio-demographic Index (SDI). FindingsBetween 1990 and 2015, global exposure to <b>unsafe</b> sanitation, household <b>air</b> pollution, childhood underweight, childhood stunting, and smoking each decreased by more than 25 %. Global exposure for several occupational risks, high body-mass index (BMI), and drug use increased by more than 25 % over the same period. All risks jointly evaluated in 2015 accounted for 57 · 8 % (95 % CI 56 · 6 – 58 · 8) of global deaths and 41 · 2 % (39 · 8 – 42 · 8) of DALYs. In 2015, the ten largest contributors to global DALYs among Level 3 risks were high systolic blood pressure (211 · 8 million [192 · 7 million to 231 · 1 million] global DALYs), smoking (148 · 6 million [134 · 2 million to 163 · 1 million]), high fasting plasma glucose (143 · 1 million [125 · 1 million to 163 · 5 million]), high BMI (120 · 1 million [83 · 8 million to 158 · 4 million]), childhood undernutrition (113 · 3 million [103 · 9 million to 123 · 4 million]), ambient particulate matter (103 · 1 million [90 · 8 million to 115 · 1 million]), high total cholesterol (88 · 7 million [74 · 6 million to 105 · 7 million]), household air pollution (85 · 6 million [66 · 7 million to 106 · 1 million]), alcohol use (85 · 0 million [77 · 2 million to 93 · 0 million]), and diets high in sodium (83 · 0 million [49 · 3 million to 127 · 5 million]). From 1990 to 2015, attributable DALYs declined for micronutrient deficiencies, childhood undernutrition, unsafe sanitation and water, and household air pollution; reductions in risk-deleted DALY rates rather than reductions in exposure drove these declines. Rising exposure contributed to notable increases in attributable DALYs from high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, occupational carcinogens, and drug use. Environmental risks and childhood undernutrition declined steadily with SDI; low physical activity, high BMI, and high fasting plasma glucose increased with SDI. In 119 countries, metabolic risks, such as high BMI and fasting plasma glucose, contributed the most attributable DALYs in 2015. Regionally, smoking still ranked among the leading five risk factors for attributable DALYs in 109 countries; childhood underweight and unsafe sex remained primary drivers of early death and disability in much of sub-Saharan Africa. InterpretationDeclines in some key environmental risks have contributed to declines in critical infectious diseases. Some risks appear to be invariant to SDI. Increasing risks, including high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, drug use, and some occupational exposures, contribute to rising burden from some conditions, but also provide opportunities for intervention. Some highly preventable risks, such as smoking, remain major causes of attributable DALYs, even as exposure is declining.
