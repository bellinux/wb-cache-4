The lessons over, writing time began; and there being but one desk and that the master's, each boy sat at it in turn and laboured at his crooked copy, while the master walked about. This was a quieter time; for he would come and look over the writer's shoulder, and tell him mildly to observe how such a letter was turned in such a copy on the wall, praise such an <b>up-stroke</b> here and such a down-stroke there, and bid him take it for his model. Then he would stop {{and tell them what}} the sick child had said last night, and how he had longed to be among them once again; and such was the poor schoolmaster's gentle and affectionate manner, that the boys seemed quite remorseful that they had worried him so much, and were absolutely quiet; eating no apples, cutting no names, inflicting no pinches, and making no grimaces, for full two minutes afterwards.|$|E

60|$|For {{by degrees}} an ominous whisper crept through the little settlement. The right {{eye of the}} commander, {{although}} miraculous, seemed to exercise a baleful effect upon the beholder. No one could look at it without winking. It was cold, hard, relentless, and unflinching. More than that, {{it seemed to be}} endowed with a dreadful prescience,--a faculty of seeing through and into the inarticulate thoughts of those it looked upon. The soldiers of the garrison obeyed the eye rather than the voice of their commander, and answered his glance rather than his lips in questioning. The servants could not evade the ever- watchful but cold attention that seemed to pursue them. The children of the presidio school smirched their copy-books under the awful supervision, and poor Paquita, the prize pupil, failed utterly in that marvelous <b>up-stroke</b> when her patron stood beside her. Gradually distrust, suspicion, self-accusation, and timidity took the place of trust, confidence, and security throughout San Carlos. Wherever the right eye of the commander fell, a shadow fell with it.|$|E

As the old man inspects, through his glasses, every <b>up-stroke</b> and down-stroke of both documents before he releases them from their leathern prison, and as he counts the money three times over and requires Judy to say every word she utters at least twice, and is as tremulously slow of speech and action as it is possible to be, this business is a long time in progress.

60|$|Evidently Biddy {{had taught}} Joe to write. As I {{lay in bed}} looking at him, it made me, in my weak state, cry again with {{pleasure}} to see the pride with which he set about his letter. My bedstead, divested of its curtains, had been removed, with me upon it, into the sitting-room, as the airiest and largest, and the carpet had been taken away, and the room kept always fresh and wholesome night and day. At my own writing-table, pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles, Joe now sat down to his great work, first choosing a pen from the pen-tray {{as if it were}} a chest of large tools, and tucking up his sleeves as if he were going to wield a crow-bar or sledgehammer. It was necessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow, and to get his right leg well out behind him, before he could begin; and when he did begin he made every down-stroke so slowly that it might have been six feet long, while at every <b>up-stroke</b> I could hear his pen spluttering extensively. He had a curious idea that the inkstand was on the side of him where it was not, and constantly dipped his pen into space, and seemed quite satisfied with the result. Occasionally, he was tripped up by some orthographical stumbling-block; but on the whole he got on very well indeed; and when he had signed his name, and had removed a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with his two forefingers, he got up and hovered about the table, trying the effect of his performance from various points of view, as it lay there, with unbounded satisfaction.|$|E

50|$|When a bird flaps, {{as opposed}} to gliding, its wings {{continue}} to develop lift as before, but the lift is rotated forward to provide thrust, which counteracts drag and increases its speed, which {{has the effect of}} also increasing lift to counteract its weight, allowing it to maintain height or to climb. Flapping involves two stages: the down-stroke, which provides the majority of the thrust, and the <b>up-stroke,</b> which can also (depending on the bird's wings) provide some thrust. At each <b>up-stroke</b> the wing is slightly folded inwards to reduce the energetic cost of flapping-wing flight. Birds change the angle of attack continuously within a flap, as well as with speed.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} in a long-distance migrant shorebird species with outspoken {{seasonal}} changes in body mass and composition, the red knot Calidris canutus, the ratio between the masses of the small flight muscle (musculus supracoracoideus, powering twists and active upstrokes of the wings) and the larger flight muscle (musculus pectoralis, for the downstrokes) is far from constant. During an annual cycle the supracoracoideus/pectoralis ratio varied more than twofold between values of 0. 058 (+/- 0. 005 SE) in early winter period and of 0. 124 (+/- 0. 05 SE) on the High Arctic tundra breeding grounds. The ratios thus spanned a range from those typical of soaring raptors and seabirds to those of fast and agile fliers and birds with rapid take-offs. The overall average ratio was 0. 102 (+/- 0. 001 SE, for non-starved knots, and 0. 103 +/- 0. 001 including starved knots) and did not differ between males and females. As predicted from the known functions of supracoracoideus and pectoralis, the ratio was a negative function of body mass. However, after arrival on the breeding grounds (0. 124) and during winter starvation (0. 135) particularly high ratios were reached: these may be times when wing-manoeuvrability (in flight display and during the evasive 'rodent run' away from predators at the nest) and an ability for rapid take-off and active <b>up-strokes</b> (from -near- the nest, and in times of depletion of flight muscle mass during winter starvation) may be at premium. The particularly low ratio of 0. 06 in early winter is puzzling. Many aspects of avian phenotypes have recently {{been shown to be}} intraindividually variable. To a twofold seasonal variation in flight muscle mass (Dietz et al. 2007), we can now add the twofold variation in the ratio between the muscles for the upstroke and the downstroke...|$|R
40|$|The flow {{fields of}} slowly flying bats and faster-flying birds differ in that bats produce two vortex loops during each stroke, one per wing, and birds produce a single vortex loop per stroke. In addition, the {{circulation}} at stroke transition approaches zero in bats but remains strong in birds. It is unknown if these difference derive from fundamental differences in wing morphology or are {{a consequence of}} flight speed. Here, we present {{an analysis of the}} horizontal flow field underneath hovering Anna’s hummingbirds (Calypte anna) to describe the wake of a bird flying at zero forward velocity. We also consider how the hummingbird tail interacts with the wake generated by the wings. High-speed image recording and analysis from three orthogonal perspectives revealed that the wing tips reach peak velocities in the middle of each stroke and approach zero velocity at stroke transition. Hummingbirds use complex tail kinematic patterns ranging from in phase to antiphase cycling with respect to the wings, covering several phase shifted patterns. We employed particle image velocimetry to attain detailed horizontal flow measurements at three levels with respect to the tail: in the tail, at the tail tip, and just below the tail. The velocity patterns underneath the wings indicate that flow oscillates along the ventral–dorsal axis in response to the down- and <b>up-strokes</b> and that the sideways flows with respect to the bird are consistently from the lateral to medial. The region around the tail is dominated by axial flows in dorsal to ventral direction. We propose that these flows are generated by interaction between the wakes of the two wings {{at the end of the}} upstroke, and that the tail actively defects flows to generate moments that contribute to pitch stability. The flow fields images also revealed distinct vortex loops underneath each wing, which were generated during each stroke. From these data, we propose a model for the primary flow structures of hummingbirds that more strongly resembles the bat model. Thus, pairs of unconnected vortex loops may be shared features of different animals during hovering and slow forward flight...|$|R
50|$|In {{typographical}} technique Playford's most original {{improvement was}} the invention in 1658 of 'the new-ty'd note.' These were quavers or semiquavers connected in pairs or series {{by one or}} two horizontal strokes {{at the end of}} their tails, the last note of the group retaining in the early examples the characteristic <b>up-stroke.</b> Hawkins observes that the Dutch printers were the first to follow the lead in this detail. In 1665 he caused every semibreve to be barred in the dance tunes; in 1672 he began engraving on copper plates. Generally, however, Playford clung to old methods; he recommended the use of lute tablature to ordinary violin players; and he resisted, in an earnest letter of remonstrance (1673), Thomas Salmon's proposals for a readjustment of clefs. Playford's printers were: Thomas Harper, 1648-1652; William Godbid, 1658-1678; Ann Godbid and her partner, John Playford the younger, 1679-1683; John Playford alone, 1684-1685.|$|E
50|$|Steel-rule die, {{also known}} as cookie cutter dies, are used for cutting sheet metal and softer webs, such as plastics, wood, cork, felt, fabrics, and paperboard. The cutting surface of the die is the edge of {{hardened}} steel strips, known as steel rule. These steel rules are usually located using saw or laser-cut grooves in plywood. The mating die can be a flat piece of hardwood or steel, a male shape that matches the workpiece profile, or it can have a matching groove that allows the rule to nest into. Rubber strips are wedged in with the steel rule to act as the stripper plate; the rubber compresses on the down-stroke and on the <b>up-stroke</b> it pushes the workpiece out of the die. The main advantage of steel-rule dies is the low cost to make them, as compared to solid dies; however, {{they are not as}} robust as solid dies, so they are usually only used for short production runs.|$|E

50|$|The {{documents}} of the mid-3rd century BC show {{a great variety of}} cursive hands. There are none from chancelleries of the Hellenistic monarchs, but some letters, notably those of Apollonius, the finance minister of Ptolemy II, to this agent, Zeno, and those of the Palestianian sheikh, Toubias, are in a type of script which cannot be very unlike the Chancery hand of the time, and show the Ptolemaic cursive at its best. These hands have a noble spaciousness and strength, and though the individual letters are by no means uniform in size there is a real unity of style, the general impression being one of breadth and uprightness. H, with the cross-stroke high, Π, Μ, with the middle stroke reduced to a very shallow curve, sometimes approaching a horizontal line, Υ, and Τ, with its cross-bar extending much further to the left than {{to the right of the}} <b>up-stroke,</b> Γ and Ν, whose last stroke is prolonged upwards above the line, often curving backwards, are all broad; ε, c, θ and β, which sometimes takes the form of two almost perpendicular strokes joined only at the top, are usually small; ω is rather flat, its second loop reduced to a practically straight line. Partly by the broad flat tops of the larger letters, partly by the insertion of a stroke connecting those (like H, Υ) which are not naturally adapted to linking, the scribes produced the effect of a horizontal line along the top of the writing, from which the letters seem to hang. This feature is indeed a general characteristic of the more formal Ptolemaic script, but it is specially marked in the 3rd century BC.|$|E

Increasing rate caused a decrease in Vma, due to interaction of three factors: (1) a metabolic factor, presumably re-setting of the Na-K pump, which caused a decrease in Vmai {{at all levels of}} resting potential between- 9 0 and- 6 0 mV, (2) a tran-sient decrease in resting potential which influenced Vma, when the resting potential was less negative than approximately- 8 0 mV, and (3) the recovery characteristics of Vma, which contributed to the decrease in this variable when rate was faster than 5 /sec. As a result of these factors the steady state curve relating membrane potential to Vmai was itself rate-dependent.

40|$|Dynamic Stall is a flow {{phenomenon}} {{which occurs}} on helicopter rotor blades during forward flight {{mainly on the}} retreating side of the rotor disc. This phenomenon limits {{the speed of the}} helicopter and its manoeuvrability. Strong excursions in drag and pitching moment are typical unfavourable characteristics of the Dynamic Stall process. However compared to the static polar the lift is considerably increased. Looking more into the flow details it is obvious that a strong concentrated vortex, the Dynamic Stall Vortex, is created during the <b>up-stroke</b> motion of the rotor blade starting very close to the blade leading edge. This vortex is growing very fast, is set into motion along the blade upper surface until it lifts off the surface to be shed into the wake. The process of vortex lift off from the surface leads to the excursions in forces and moment mentioned above. The Dynamic Stall phenomenon does also occur on blades of stall regulated wind turbines under yawing conditions as well as during gust loads. Time scales occurring during this process are comparable on both helicopter and wind turbine blades. In the present paper the different aspects of unsteady flows during the Dynamic Stall process are discussed in some detail. Some possibilities are also pointed out to favourably influence dynamic stall by either static or dynamic flow control devices. ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: In acute {{myocardial}} ischemia {{changes within}} the QRS complex can add valuable information to {{that from the}} repolarization phase. This study evaluates three angles obtained from the main slopes of the R-wave within the QRS complex to assess acute myocardial ischemia. Methods: The QRS angles, denoted by empty set(R) (R-wave angle), empty set(U) (<b>up-stroke</b> angle) and empty set(D) (down-stroke angle), were evaluated in 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of 79 patients before and during coronary occlusion by elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In a subset of 38 patients, ischemia was quantified by myocardial scintigraphy. Results: At baseline the QRS angles presented low variations. During occlusion, empty set(U) and empty set(D) developed a fast and abrupt change, whereas empty set(R) showed a smaller and gradual change. There were significant correlations between both maximal and sum of positive change in empty set(R) and ischemia: r = 0. 67; p < 0 : 001 and r = 0. 78; p < 0. 001, for extent, and r = 0. 60; p < 0. 001 and r = 0. 73; p < 0. 001, for severity, respectively. Prediction of extent and severity of ischemia increased by 50 % by adding empty set(R) changes to ST-segment changes, for LCX occlusions, whereas increased by 12. 1 % and 24. 6 % for LAD and RCA occlusions, respectively. No significant correlation was seen between empty set(u) and empty set(D) angles and ischemia. Conclusions: Evaluation of QRS angles from the standard 12 -lead ECG represents a sensitive marker for detection of acute myocardial ischemia, whereas, empty set(R) changes {{can be used for}} prediction of its extent and severity.

40|$|Instantaneous {{ascending}} aortic {{blood flow}} was recorded at operation in five patients with severe, pure mitral regurgitation, and in nine dogs in which mitral re-gurgitation was produced experimentally under controlled conditions. In both the patients and the experimental animals, {{the pattern of}} aortic flow was abnormal during mitral regurgitation: peak flow occurred early, the percentage of total forward flow was abnormally high {{during the first half}} of the ejection period and abnormally low during the last quarter. When stroke volume, heart rate, and aortic pressure were maintained constant, mitral regurgitation also resulted in increases in peak flow, mean ejection rate, and maximum acceleration of flow. These abnormalities of the aortic flow patterns are attributable to inability of the ventricle to sustain forward ejection during late systole in the presence of severe regurgitant flow through the mitral valve. Additional Indexing Words: Left ventricular pressure Peak flow Total forward flow Ejection period ONE of the physical findings commonly noted in patients with severe mitral regurgitation is an abnormal peripheral ar-terial pulse, usually described as being slightly water-hammer in quality, with an abrupt <b>up-stroke</b> and early precipitous downstroke. When such patients are studied by means of left heart catheterization, the contour of the left ventricular pressure pulse may also demonstrate a characteristic abnormality: the pressure rises rapidly during isometric con-traction and declines at an unusually rapid rate during the late ejection period, the time at which the left atrial pressure becomes greatest. These abnormal patterns of arterial and ventricular pressure suggested that severe mitral regurgitation might also alter the pat-tern of instantaneous aortic flow, and this possibility was the subject of the clinical and laboratory investigations described herein...|$|E
40|$|Background Because of {{the optical}} {{features}} of heart tissue, optical and electrical action potentials are only moderately associated, especially when near-infrared dyes {{are used in}} optical map-ping (OM) studies. Objective By simultaneously recording transmural electrical action potentials (APs) and optical action potentials (OAPs), we aimed to evaluate the contributions of both electrical and optical influ-ences {{to the shape of}} the OAP upstroke. Methods and Results A standard glass microelectrode and OM, using an near-infrared fluorescent dye (di- 4 -ANBDQBS), were used to simultaneously record transmural APs and OAPs in a Langen-dorff-perfused rabbit heart during atrial, endocardial, and epicardial pacing. The actual pro-file of the transmural AP upstroke across the LV wall, together with the OAP upstroke, allowed for calculations of the probing-depth constant (k ~ 2. 1 mm, n = 24) of the fluores-cence measurements. In addition, the transmural AP recordings aided the quantitative eval-uation of the influences of depth-weighted and lateral-scattering components on the OAP upstroke. These components correspond to the components of the propagating electrical wave that are transmural and parallel to the epicardium. The calculated mean values for the depth-weighted and lateral-scattering components, whose sum comprises the OAP <b>up-stroke,</b> were (in ms) 10. 18 ± 0. 62 and 0. 0 ± 0. 56 for atrial stimulation, 9. 37 ± 1. 12 and 3. 01 ± 1. 30 for endocardial stimulation, and 6. 09 ± 0. 79 and 8. 16 ± 0. 98 for epicardial stimulation; (n = 8 for each).

40|$|We {{present the}} visual {{analysis}} of a biologically inspired CFD simulation of the deformable flapping wings of a dragonfly as it takes off and begins to maneuver, using vortex detection and integration-based flow lines. The additional seed placement and perceptual challenges introduced by having multiple dynamically deforming objects in the highly unsteady 3 D flow domain are addressed. A brief overview of the high speed photogrammetry setup used to capture the dragonfly takeoff, parametric surfaces used for wing reconstruction, CFD solver and underlying flapping flight theory is presented to clarify the importance of several unsteady flight mechanisms, such as the leading edge vortex, that are captured visually. A novel interactive seed placement method is used to simplify the generation of seed curves that stay {{in the vicinity of}} relevant flow phenomena as they move with the flapping wings. This method allows a user to define and evaluate the quality of a seed 2 ̆ 7 s trajectory over time while working with a single time step. The seed curves are then used to place particles, streamlines and generalized streak lines. The novel concept of flowing seeds is also introduced in order to add visual context about the instantaneous vector fields surrounding smoothly animate streak lines. Tests show this method to be particularly effective at visually capturing vortices that move quickly or that exist for a very brief period of time. In addition, an automatic camera animation method is used to address occlusion issues caused when animating the immersed wing boundaries alongside many geometric flow lines. Each visualization method is presented at multiple time steps during the <b>up-stroke</b> and down-stroke to highlight the formation, attachment and shedding of the leading edge vortices in pairs of wings. Also, the visualizations show evidence of wake capture at stroke reversal which suggests the existence of previously unknown unsteady lift generation mechanisms that are unique to qua- wing insects...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{events and}} {{intracellular}} calcium concentration ([Ca 2 +]) imaged using fluo- 3 and laser scanning confocal microscopy were simultaneously monitored in single smooth muscle cells freshly isolated from guinea-pig vas deferens or urinary bladder. Images obtained every 8 ms, during stepping from - 60 to 0 or + 10 mV for 50 ms under voltage clamp, {{showed that a}} rise in [Ca 2 +] could be detected within 20 ms of depolarization in five to twenty small (< 2 μm diameter) ‘hot spots’, over 95 % of which were located within 1. 5 μm of the cell membrane. Depolarization at 30 s intervals activated hot spots at the same places. Cd 2 + or verapamil abolished both hot spots and Ca 2 +-activated K+ current (IK,Ca). Caffeine almost abolished hot spots and markedly reduced IK,Ca. Cyclopiazonic acid, which raised basal global [Ca 2 +], decreased the rise in hot spot [Ca 2 +] and IK,Ca amplitude during depolarization. These results suggest that Ca 2 + entry caused Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 + release (CICR). Under voltage clamp, hot spot [Ca 2 +] closely paralleled the rise in IK,Ca and reached a peak within 20 ms of the start of depolarization, but the rise in global [Ca 2 +] over the whole cell area was much slower. Step depolarization to potentials positive to - 20 mV caused hot spots to grow in size and coalesce, leading to a rise in global [Ca 2 +] and contraction. Ca 2 + hot spots also occurred during the <b>up-stroke</b> of an evoked action potential under current clamp. It is concluded that the entry of Ca 2 + {{in the early stages}} of an action potential evokes CICR from discrete subplasmalemma Ca 2 + storage sites and generates hot spots that spread to initiate a contraction. The activation of Ca 2 +-dependent K+ channels in the plasmalemma over hot spots initiates IK,Ca and action potential repolarization...|$|E
40|$|Peripheral plasma or serum {{concentrations}} of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, and cortisol and insulin secretory rates (ISR) were determined at 15 -min intervals in eight normal subjects during a constant iv infusion of 4. 5 mg glucose/kg� min for a 24 -h period. During each sampling interval, the secretory rate of insulin {{was calculated by}} deconvolution of the peripheral plasma C-peptide concentration using C-peptide kinetic parameters derived after bolus injections of C-peptide in individual subjects. Periodogram analysis of the individual glucose curves demonstrated a circadian rhythm in all subjects, with a major nocturnal acrophase occurring at an average clock time of 0228 h (range, 0045 - 0350 h). In five of the eight subjects, a minor acrophase occurred at an average time of 1774 h (range, 1530 - 2045 h). This diurnal variation in plasma glucose levels was not paralleled by a similar pattern in insulin secretion. Although glucose was infused at a constant rate, significant pulses were found in glucose, insulin, and C-peptide levels and ISR; the pulse durations of these parameters were 182 ± 30 (± SE), 89 ± 5, 100 ± 8, and 85 ± 5 min, respectively, and their periodicities were 208 ± 33, 106 ± 7, 114 ± 10, and 106 ± 7 min. The durations and frequencies for pulses of insulin, C-peptide, and ISR were not significantly different, whereas glucose pulses had a longer duration and were less frequent (P < 0. 05, by analysis of variance). On the average, 54 ± 9 % of the C-peptide pulses and 47 ± 8 % of the ISR pulses were concomitant with a pulse in glucose levels. Moreover, {{approximately half of the}} Cpeptide and ISR pulses that were not concomitant with a glucose pulse occurred in synchrony with a shoulder on the <b>up-stroke</b> or down-stroke of glucose pulses. Analysis of glucagon and cortisol profiles revealed no significant associations with the insulin and glucose oscillations. In conclusion, during a constant glucose infusion in normal subjects, regular oscillations of insulin secretion occur at 80 - to 120 -min intervals. Their tight coupling with glucose oscillations and the lack of association with fluctuations of glucagon and cortisol suggest that these oscillations represent a dynamic property of the insulin-glucose feedback loop.
