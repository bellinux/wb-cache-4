5000|$|Synthesis anarchism {{is a form}} of anarchist {{organization}} that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives.

50|$|The Mexican <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> (sp: Federación Anarquista Mexicana) was a Mexican anarchist {{organization}} that existed from December 28, 1945 until the 1970s. It appeared as the <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> of the Center {{joined with the}} <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> of the Federal District. It published the periodical Regeneración. It received the energy of recent Spanish anarchists who sought refuge in Mexico escaping from Francisco Franco´s dictatorship.|$|R
5000|$|The Italian <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> (Federazione Anarchica Italiana) is an Italian <b>anarchist</b> <b>federation</b> of {{autonomous}} <b>anarchist</b> groups all over Italy. The Italian <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> {{was founded in}} 1945 in Carrara. It adopted an [...] "Associative Pact" [...] and the [...] "Anarchist Program" [...] of Errico Malatesta.

50|$|Anarchism {{sought to}} reorganize itself after the war. The Mexican <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> was {{established}} on 1945 after the <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> of the Center united with the <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> of the Federal District. In the early 1940s Antifascist International Solidarity and <b>Federation</b> of <b>Anarchist</b> Groups of Cuba merge {{into the large}} national organization Asociación Libertaria de Cuba (Cuban Libertarian Association). From 1944 to 1947, the Bulgarian <b>Anarchist</b> Communist <b>Federation</b> reemerges {{as part of a}} factory and workplace committee movement, but is repressed by the new Communist regime. In 1945 in France the Fédération Anarchiste is established and the also synthesist Federazione Anarchica Italiana is founded in Italy. Korean anarchists form the League of Free Social Constructors in September 1945 and in 1946 the Japanese <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> is founded. An International Anarchist Congress with delegates from across Europe is held in Paris in May 1948. In 1956 the Uruguayan <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> is founded. In 1955 the Anarcho-Communist Federation of Argentina renames itself as the Argentine Libertarian Federation.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Anarchist</b> Communist <b>Federation</b> (ACF) {{changed its}} name to the <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> in the late 1999 as {{mentioned}} in Organize Issue 52. Unlike its French counterpart it is therefore not a true <b>federation</b> of <b>anarchists</b> but rather a faction composed of advocates of Anarchist-Communism. The <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> places itself amongst a continually developing current of autonomous working class struggle. Important influences on the Anarchist Federation's politics include The Organisational Platform of Libertarian Communists, the Manifesto of Libertarian Communism, Solidarity and the anarchist communist currents within the Spanish, Russian and Ukrainian Revolutions. The <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> promotes an understanding of intersectionality in Anarchist thought. [...] The <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> continues this tradition of agitation within the workplace and community, rather than attempting to gain prominent bureaucratic positions in trade unions, local councils and other institutions, unlike a number of socialist and communist parties and groups. It promotes grassroots direct activism against the state and capitalism and is run in a horizontalist manner. The <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation(</b> [...] particularly the scottish sections) took positions critical of Scottish independence during the Independence referendum viewing it as nationalist, but it did not dictate to its members whether to vote or not or how. The Scottish sections of the <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> are involved with the Action Against Austerity network.|$|R
5000|$|Libertarian Communism was {{a socialist}} journal founded in 1974 and {{produced}} {{in part by}} members of the Socialist Party of Great Britain. The synthesist Italian <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> and the platformist <b>Federation</b> of <b>Anarchist</b> Communists continue existing today in Italy but insurrectionary anarchism continues to be relevant as the recent establishment of the Informal <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> shows. In the seventies in France the Fédération Anarchiste evolved into a joining of the principles of both synthesis anarchism and platformism but later the platformist organizations Libertarian Communist Organization (France) in 1976 and Alternative libertaire in 1991 appeared with this last one existing until today alongside the synthesist Fédération Anarchiste. In recent times platformist organisations founded the now-defunct International Libertarian Solidarity network and its successor, the Anarkismo network; which is run collaboratively by roughly 30 platformist organisations around the world. On the other hand, contemporary insurrectionary anarchism inherits the views and tactics of anti-organizational anarcho-communism and [...] "illegalism". The Informal <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> (not {{to be confused with the}} synthesist Italian <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> also FAI) is an Italian insurrectionary anarchist organization. It has been described by Italian intelligence sources as a [...] "horizontal" [...] structure of various anarchist terrorist groups, united in their beliefs in revolutionary armed action. In 2003, the group claimed responsibility for a bomb campaign targeting several European Union institutions. Currently alongside the previously mentioned federations, the International of <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federations</b> includes the Argentine Libertarian <b>Federation,</b> the <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> of Belarus, the <b>Federation</b> of <b>Anarchists</b> in Bulgaria, the Czech-Slovak <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation,</b> the Federation of German speaking Anarchists in Germany and Switzerland, and the <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> in the United Kingdom and Ireland.|$|R

50|$|The Syndicalist Workers' Federation was a syndicalist {{group in}} active in post-war Britain, {{and one of}} the Solidarity Federation's {{earliest}} predecessors. It was formed in 1950 by members of the dissolved <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> of Britain (not {{to be confused with the}} current <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> which was founded as the <b>Anarchist</b> Communist <b>Federation</b> in 1986). Unlike the AFB, which was influenced by anarcho-syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself, the SWF decided to pursue a more definitely syndicalist, worker-centred strategy from the outset.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> is {{a member}} {{organisation}} of the Anarchist International of <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federations</b> (IAF-IFA), but also has its own secretariat responsible for {{regions of the world}} that do not have IAF-IFA members. The principles of work within IFA are that of federalism, free arrangement and mutual aid. To improve co-ordination and communication within IFA, as well as to provide an open contact address for the public and other anarchist groups and organisations, an International Secretariat (C.R.I.F.A. - Commission of Relations of the International of <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federations)</b> was set up. CRIFA irregularly rotates among the IFA federations. It is currently based with the Federación Anarquista Ibérica (FAI).|$|R

5000|$|In Italy in 1945 {{during the}} Founding Congress of the Italian <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation,</b> individualists <b>anarchists</b> {{were led by}} Cesare Zaccaria. During the 1965 IX Congress of the Italian <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> in Carrara a {{splinter}} group created the Gruppi di Iniziativa Anarchica. In the 1970s, it was mostly composed of [...] "veteran individualist anarchists with an orientation of pacifism, naturism, etc,...".|$|R
5000|$|The JAF {{was plagued}} by {{disputes}} between anarcho-communists and anarcho-syndicalists and in October 1950 it split into two groups, the Japan Anarchist Club and the <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation,</b> the latter of which reclaimed the name Japanese <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> in 1955. Starting in 1956, this new syndicalist JAF produced and distributed a publication titled Kuro Hata (Black Flag) which was later renamed [...] Free Association.|$|R
5000|$|In the IX Congress of the Italian <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> in Carrara, 1965 a group {{decided to}} split off from this {{organization}} and creates the Gruppi di Iniziativa Anarchica which was mostly composed of individualist anarchists who disagreed with {{important aspects of}} the [...] "Associative Pact" [...] and was critical of anarcho-syndicalism. The GIA published the bi-weekly L'Internazionale. Another group split off from the <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> and regrouped as Gruppi Anarchici Federati. The GAF later starts publishing Interrogations and A Rivista Anarchica. In 1968 in Carrara the International of <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federations</b> was founded during an international Anarchist conference by the three existing European federations of France, the Italian FAI and the Iberian <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> as well as the Bulgarian federation in French exile. In the early seventies a platformist tendency emerged within the Italian <b>Anarchist</b> <b>Federation</b> which argued for more strategic coherence and social insertion in the workers movement while rejecting the synthesist [...] "Associative Pact" [...] of Malatesta which the FAI adhered to. These groups started organizing themselves outside the FAI in organizations such as O.R.A. from Liguria which organized a Congress attended by 250 delegates of groups from 60 locations. In 1986, the Congress of ORA/UCAT adopted the name <b>Federation</b> of <b>Anarchist</b> Communists.|$|R
