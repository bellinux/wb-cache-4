500|$|Matt Hills and Rebecca Williams also {{discuss the}} {{treatment}} of Cordelia (and Darla) in [...] "Angels Monstrous Mothers and Vampires with Soul: Investigating the Abject in 'Television Horror'", from [...] by Stacey Abbot. They see the send-offs of Cordelia, Fred and other characters {{as part of a}} pattern of highly gendered [...] "elaborated abjection" [...] seen in Angel. They also see Cordelia's possession in season four as part of a recurring pattern: [...] "More so than other characters in [...] and Angel, Cordelia has suffered or been threatened with bodily invasion and rape, either symbolically or literally" [...] and recounts the demon impregnation in [...] "Expecting", and similarly in [...] "Epiphany", where she develops a gestating demon in her head and then told she must mate with the Groosalugg in [...] "Through the Looking Glass". Cordelia even remarks on this, as Hills and Williams quote her as she remarks on her [...] "status as a violated and devalued character"; Cordelia states, [...] "If you ever {{figure out how to get}} <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here,</b> I want you to find me a dimension where some demon doesn't want to impregnate me with his spawn!" [...] They liken the horror motif in these examples, and in [...] "Inside Out", to what Barbara Creed called the 'monstrous womb' in her book The Monstrous-feminine: Film, Feminism, Psychoanalysis. Jes Battis also comments how, in comparison with the Fred-Illyria season five storyline, Cordelia's storyline is not as positive as Fred's rebirth, because Fred got to [...] "'live on' through Illyria, whereas Cordelia is taken right out of the show and receives no interesting blue-haired reincarnation". Continuing, they say that in fact, there is no meaningful connection between the [...] "real" [...] Cordelia and Jasmine, as the Cordelia who did those bad things is killed the moment Jasmine is, [...] "and the 'true' Cordy wakes up from her coma". Further illustrating the comparisons, [...] "Fred/Illyria become a joined mother/daughter subjectivity, a dual being whose constituent essences are inseparable; Cordelia is never so intimately connected with her evil child and is remembered as the healthy, vibrant Cordy that everyone knew." [...] Pointing out symbolic parallels in the subtexts of these gestations, Battis notes Cordelia, a vocal advocate of her own privilege, creates a fully formed supernatural being, Jasmine, who attempts (shockingly) to control the world. Fred, on the other hand, who internalizes her own privilege and cannot express it except in terms of insecurity and awkwardness, has her body devoured from the inside by the demon Illyria.|$|E

40|$|The {{prevention}} of Japanese encephalitis in travelers presents {{the juxtaposition of}} 4 factors: a disease that is widespread throughout Asia, a disease with a low incidence in travelers, a vaccine about which there are safety concerns, and a clinical course that can result in death or permanent disability in two-thirds of symptomatic cases. Travel medicine practitioners often seem to be polarized into 2 groups: a group that gives more weight to {{the severity of the}} disease (and therefore often recommend vaccination) and another group that is more persuaded by the low occurrence of cases in travelers (and therefore rarely recommend vaccination). This review assesses the known risks of contracting Japanese encephalitis and the risks associated with the vaccine and tries to develop an appropriate way to recommend this vaccine to travelers who may be at significant risk. The popular movie “Chicken Run ” is about chickens trying to escape from a prisoner-of-war camp–like enclosure to avoid being turned into chicken pot pies. After a series of unsuccessful escape attempts, one of the fearful chickens says to the heroine, Ginger, “The chances <b>of</b> <b>us</b> getting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here</b> are a million to one. ” To which Ginger replies, “Then there’s still a chance. ...|$|R

They were joined by The Screen Gemz' bass player Alfie Thomas, drummer Bryn Burrows, and keyboardist John Warwicker in forming a proto-electroclash/new wave band whose name was a graphic squiggle, which was subsequently given the pronunciation Freur.

In 1987, Hyde, Smith, Thomas and Burrows, along with bassist Baz Allen signed to Sire Records under a new name, Underworld, and found some success with the single [...] "Underneath the Radar" [...] (1988) (it peaked in Australia at No. 5), before initially folding in 1990.

40|$|At {{the heart}} of the "American" psyche is an engrained urge to roam. From the {{original}} colonial settlers to manifest destiny and from highways to the moon landing, the great American future has always existed somewhere just beyond the horizon. As the 21 st century closes its first tenth, the proliferation of semi-autonomous and autonomous machines -funded by the Department of Defense via the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) -indicates the potential for larger structures to move semi-autonomously in the near future. (That is architectural typologies will emerge as semi-autonomous, mobile entities. As there is an estimated U. S. population of 3 million people who live primarily in mobile recreational vehicles, it is not absurd to imagine a transition from houses on wheels to houses on legs.) Because architecture currently faces the overwhelming burdens of energy reliance, infrastructural sprawl, and cultural differences it is perhaps time to introduce a radical solution and postulate to its theoretical limits in order to catalyze impetus for meaningful change. If only there were a gizmo to help get <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here</b> [...] . It is the uniquely American obsession with technology, which Reyner Banham details in The Great Gizmo, that has fueled the most critical transitions through history and it is technology that informs the premise of this thesis. According to the DARPA website, "throughout history technical challenges have inspired generations". Through a combination of research, creative work, reality, and philosophical projection Where the Sidewalk Ends provides insight and possible solutions for a tumultuous era. This thesis contains a creative composition and selection of coursework from ARCH 402 with Michael Silver as well as additional narrative and reflection. Narrative, images, processes, and end products are combined into a book to capture the topic and selected activities from ARCH 402 for the benefit of future Ball State students.
