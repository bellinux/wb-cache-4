Producer Brian Fleming found that the graphical effects helped to inform players of the amount of power Delsin possesses. [...] "This is a game about super powers, so for <b>us,</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the effects look tells you a lot about how you're playing the game", he explained.

500|$|Benedict de Spinoza in his Ethics, {{published}} {{after his}} death in 1677, argued that most people, even those that consider themselves to exercise free will, make moral decisions on the basis of imperfect sensory information, inadequate understanding of their mind and will, as well as emotions which are both outcomes of their contingent physical existence and forms of thought defective from being chiefly impelled by self-preservation. The solution, according to Spinoza, was to gradually increase the capacity of our reason to change the forms of thought produced by emotions and {{to fall in love with}} viewing problems requiring moral decision from the perspective of eternity. Thus, living a life of peaceful conscience means to Spinoza that reason is used to generate adequate ideas where the mind increasingly sees the world and its conflicts, our desires and passions sub specie aeternitatis, that is without reference to time. Hegel's obscure and mystical Philosophy of Mind held that the absolute right of freedom of conscience facilitates human understanding of an all-embracing unity, an absolute which was rational, real and true. Nevertheless, Hegel thought that a functioning State would always be tempted not to recognize conscience in its form of subjective knowledge, just as similar non-objective opinions are generally rejected in science. A similar idealist notion was expressed in the writings of Joseph Butler who argued that conscience is God-given, should always be obeyed, is intuitive, and should be considered the [...] "constitutional monarch" [...] and the [...] "universal moral faculty": [...] "conscience does not only offer itself to show <b>us</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> we should walk in, but it likewise carries its own authority with it." [...] Butler advanced ethical speculation by referring to a duality of regulative principles in human nature: first,"self-love" [...] (seeking individual happiness) and second, [...] "benevolence" [...] (compassion and seeking good for another) in conscience (also linked to the agape of situational ethics). Conscience tended to be more authoritative in questions of moral judgment, thought Butler, because it was more likely to be clear and certain (whereas calculations of self-interest tended to probable and changing conclusions). John Selden in his Table Talk expressed the view that an awake but excessively scrupulous or ill-trained conscience could hinder resolve and practical action; it being [...] "like a horse that is not well wayed, he starts at every bird that flies out of the hedge".|$|E
2500|$|The {{emphasis}} on the salvific nature of the Resurrection continued in Christian theology in the next centuries, e.g., in the 8th century Saint John of Damascus wrote that: [...] "...When he had freed those who were bound {{from the beginning of}} time, Christ returned again from among the dead, having opened for <b>us</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to resurrection" [...] and Christian iconography of the ensuing years represented that concept.|$|E
2500|$|Its {{emphasis}} {{is not on}} us (our sinfulness) but on God’s mercy and salvific action in Jesus Christ. [...] It could just as accurately be translated [...] "O Lord, you are merciful!" [...] Note that the sample tropes all mention what Christ has done for us, not how we have sinned. [...] For example, “you were sent to heal the contrite,” “you have shown <b>us</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to the Father,” or “you come in word and sacrament to strengthen us in holiness,” leading to further acclamation of God’s praises in the Gloria.|$|E

Filled with humor and pain, it verges on profundity in its examination of those things—customs, habits, language, symbols, daily routines, etc.—that simultaneously unite and separate human beings." [...] A reviewer for The Christian Century described it as [...] "an absorbing, plausible book": [...] "The reader becomes absorbed {{not only in the}} mystery of a murdered dog and a missing mom, but also in the mysterious world of an autistic child." ...|$|E

New Hugo owner Henrik Kølle stated in October 2012 that Hugo Games A/S [...] "is happy that the traditional Hugo countries, where Hugo was aired in the '90s, still love Hugo and seemingly can’t get enough of him. [...] Angry Birds have shown <b>us</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> here, so now we are hard at work on, among other things, a film project, exciting licensing deals for toys and finally we hope to release another Hugo game in time for summer 2013." [...] On 28 November 2012, Krea Medie was acquired by Egmont Group, but Hugo Games and the rights to Hugo were not part of the sale agreement with Egmont. A possible new Hugo live show was hinted in July 2014. Hugo Games is owned and managed by Henry Mallet, and was valued at DKK 56 million and generating an annual income of about DKK 10 million as estimated in September 2014 when the company was listed for investment as HUGO NewHold ApS.|$|E
2500|$|Eric, having {{finished}} his quest, {{returns to his}} grave. Sarah goes {{to say goodbye to}} him and he gives her Shelly's engagement ring. She is then abducted by Grange, who takes her into the church where Top Dollar and Myca are waiting. Through the crow, Eric realizes what has happened and goes to rescue her. Grange shoots the crow as it flies into the church, making Eric lose his invincibility. Myca grabs the wounded crow, intending to take its mystical power. Albrecht arrives, intending to pay his respects to Eric, just after Eric is shot and wounded. Top Dollar grabs Sarah and climbs the bell tower as a fight ensues, and Grange is killed by Albrecht. The crow escapes Myca's grip, pecking her eyes out and sending her down the bell tower to her death. When Albrecht is wounded, Eric climbs to the roof of the church on his own. There, Top Dollar admits ultimate responsibility for what happened to Eric and Shelly. In their fight, Eric, despite being fatally stabbed in the back, gives Top Dollar the thirty hours of pain he absorbed from Albrecht; the sensation sends Top Dollar over the roof of the church to be impaled on the horns of a gargoyle. Sarah and Albrecht go to the hospital, and Eric is reunited with Shelly at their graves. Sarah ends the film with a narration: [...] "If the people we love are stolen from <b>us,</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to have them live on is to never stop loving them.
