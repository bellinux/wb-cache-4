40|$|The {{scope of}} this thesis is to analyze the {{feasibility}} of having different wireless mesh network architectures transfer data to a wired network via a joint (<b>universal)</b> <b>access</b> <b>point</b> (UAP). Additionally this thesis analyzes the feasibility of using similar joint (<b>universal)</b> <b>access</b> <b>point</b> technology to allow heterogeneous wireless mesh network devices in close proximally to the UAP transmit data to/from each other via the UAP. This research also includes evaluating COTS tools for possible implementation of a joint access point as well as seeking partnership with private industry to assist in research efforts and/or the development or joint (<b>universal)</b> <b>access</b> <b>point</b> solution(s). The thesis concludes with a recommendation on application of universal joint point technology, to include recommendations for implementation of such technology in the Tactical Network Topology (TNT) environment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Mobile {{phones are}} rapidly {{becoming}} the <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> <b>point</b> for computing, communication, and digital infrastructures. In this {{paper we explore}} the software architectures necessary to make the mobile phone a truly <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> <b>point</b> to any electronic infrastructure. We propose AlfredO, a lightweight middleware architecture that allows developers to construct applications in a modular way, organizing the applications into detachable tiers that can be distributed at will to dynamically configure multi-tier architectures between mobile phones and service providers. Through AlfredO, a phone can lease on-the-fly the client side of an application and immediately become a fully tailored client. Our experimental results indicate that AlfredO has very little overhead, it is scalable, and yields very low latency. To demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the platform, in the paper we also describe AlfredOShop, a prototype application for spontaneously controlling information screens from a mobile phone...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} two-layer coding {{algorithm}} {{to improve the}} performance of the H. 264 -based lossless (H. 264 -LS) image coding. From <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> <b>point</b> of view, the proposed method is based on the H. 264 lossy image coding with other CABAC layer to compensate the lossy portion. Besides, the H. 264 -LS with DPCM (H. 264 -LS_DPCM) and H. 264 -LS achieve different coding performance in use of CABAC and CAVLC entropy coders without the DCT and quantization. We further suggest an adaptive entropy coding (AEC) algorithm to determine the best entropy coder by using the image content variations, which is calculated from the sum of absolute difference of intra prediction. Simulation results show that the proposed AEC method have good correct detection rates and improvement of compression rate for H. 264 -LS and H. 264 -LS_DPCM coders. The two-layer H. 264 -LS almost have the same compression rate than the H. 264 -LS_DPCM. Index Terms Image coding, image compression...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{appears on}} an edited {{book on the}} history and {{political}} economy of the local television sector in Italy. It looks at the implication of digitalisation {{for the future of}} local television in Italy, critically assessing the argument that Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT), and in particular local DTT, will provide a <b>universal</b> and affordable <b>access</b> <b>point</b> to the Internet-based services, and more specifically, to new interactive services provided by central and local administrations, thus contributing to the renovation of the local broadcasting sector. The chapter recounts how the centre-right government led by Silvio Berlusconi put a considerable amount of rhetorical effort at promoting the vision of DTT as a ‘democratic gateway to the Information Society’ in order to legitimise its pro-active policy aimed at speeding up the roll out of the new technology. Drawing on analyses of more advanced experiences in countries like the UK, the chapter examines the flaws inherent in the vision of DTT as a major route to the Information Society...|$|R

40|$|Real-time {{communication}} {{evolved from}} the traditional telephony network to Internet-based audio/video conferencing tools and instant messaging software. Third-party plug-ins and extensions added the same capabilities to Web-based browser applications. Vendor-specific heterogeneity in software and hardware requirements brought up interoperability issues. There were no common set of communication protocols. The Web browser as a <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> <b>point</b> to the Web was facing a challenge in real-time communication. To natively support real-time communication in the Web browser, Web-based Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) was introduced. It provides three main features i. e. access to the user's hardware, peer-to-peer connection between the browsers and arbitrary data exchange through its DataChannel application programming interface (API). These features are added in the browser as one extra protocol stack that can be accessed by a Web application with JavaScript API's. The DataChannel API provides several use cases and {{it is interesting to}} examine the behavior of the WebRTC DataChannel {{from the point of view}} of developers, enterprises, Web services and service providers. In this thesis we investigate the WebRTC DataChannel API. We design and implement two prototypes of a WebRTC based collaboration application. These were based on the respective specification by the Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers. A case study is proposed for data communication between two collaborative environments one consisting of an enterprise tool and the other being a non-enterprise tool based on WebRTC DataChannel and IP Multimedia Subsystem. The performance evaluation of the implementation is also carried out by comparing various other tools in a controlled environment...|$|E

50|$|As <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> {{continues}} to {{be incorporated into the}} U.S. education system, professors and instructors at the college level are required (in some instances by law) to rethink methods of facilitating <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> in their classrooms. <b>Universal</b> <b>access</b> to college education may involve the provision of a variety of different assessment methods of learning and retention. For example, in order to determine how much of the material was learned, a professor may enlist multiple methods of assessment. Methods of assessment may include a comprehensive exam, unit exams, portfolios, research papers, literature reviews, an oral exam or homework assignments. Providing a variety of ways to assess the extent of learning and retention will not only identify the gaps in <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> but may also elucidate the ways to improve <b>universal</b> <b>access.</b>|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{presents}} a consolidated overview of methods and techniques {{used to promote}} <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> thinking {{in the design of}} interactive software (e. g., applications and services). The first part of the chapter introduces and analyzes the concept of <b>universal</b> <b>access,</b> addresses its implications {{in the context of an}} Information Society and motivates the need for a code of design practice for <b>universal</b> <b>access.</b> In the second part, the chapter provides a literature review highlighting some of the representative efforts devoted to understanding <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> and addressing specific research and development challenges. Then, it describes a scenario-based methodology, underlying the work of the IS 4 ALL Thematic network, towards compiling a consolidated <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> code of practice and validating it in designated Health Telematics reference scenarios. The proposed code of practice comprises detailed description of a process-oriented (macro-level) method, overviews of specific micro-level design techniques and examples of their application by <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> practitioners in the context of reference scenarios depicting access to Web-based applications.

40|$|Universal {{service is}} governed by a {{regulatory}} framework that guarantees nationwide access to basic telephone service over the {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN). The ongoing network migration to IP networks, however, poses the question of how the existing framework would accommodate this change. Taking the case of Japan, this paper presents an overview of Japan's universal service system under the network migration and argues the importance of assessing consumer preference for universal service in adapting the system to this new environment. After describing the existing system including the universal service fund and the impacts of the transition to IP networks, the government's responses to cope with the change are reviewed. A system of <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> is proposed which is designed to ensure access rather than a specific service. To realize a new regulatory framework for <b>universal</b> <b>access,</b> studies will be necessary on issues such as the scope of <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> and ensuring sufficient compensation. Emphasizing the importance to evaluate consumer preference or willingness-to-pay for <b>universal</b> <b>access,</b> an empirical analysis in an experimental framework is conducted, which examines whether consumers are willing to accept the additional burden of sustaining <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> if they are well informed about the issue. Finally, challenges for future studies on <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> are referred. <b>Universal</b> service PSTN IP networks Network migration Universal service fund <b>Universal</b> <b>access</b> Willingness-to-pay Japan...|$|R

40|$|In a car-based society, {{transportation}} {{has both}} {{environmental and economic}} implications. However, public transportation, and programs like <b>Universal</b> <b>Access</b> that promote public transportation by providing ‘fare free’ access to specific groups in the community, can offer low cost, sustainable alternatives to car-based transportation. The basic concept behind <b>Universal</b> <b>Access</b> is that a community group contracts with the local public transit system to provide unlimited access to public transportation for individuals within the group at a negotiated cost to the group (Toor et. al 2004). The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine the feasibility of creating a <b>Universal</b> <b>Access</b> program for one college campus, Illinois Wesleyan University (IWU).

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the topic of}} <b>Universal</b> <b>Access</b> [...] specifically <b>Universal</b> <b>Access</b> to telecommunications in rural areas of developing countries [...] from the policy perspectives of telecommunication policy reform and of complementary <b>Universal</b> <b>Access</b> public subsidy mechanisms. Starting with broad lessons learned on competition in telecommunications, the report will narrow in onto the specific mechanism of minimum-subsidy auctions for <b>Universal</b> <b>Access</b> to telecommunications. First of all, how does competition in telecommunications affect Universal Access/Service? What roles does competition play on technological innovations such as Internet or mobile? And what regulatory safeguards have been or are necessary to enable competition and to promote Universal Access/Service? We will first analyse the experiences of OECD countries that started reforming their telecommunication markets early on, to gather insight into the process and impact of telecommunication reform. We will also review complementary mechanisms that OECD countries have set up to subsidise <b>Universal</b> <b>Access</b> in the areas unlikely to be covered by market forces alone. We will then review some regulatory measures that can help to provide <b>Universal</b> <b>Access</b> to the rural areas of developing countries without subsidies, and we will discuss some cost-effective ways for developing countries to provide incentives to markets to expand telecommunication infrastructure to poor rural areas, before making use of subsidies [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{the contribution of}} adaptive techniques to <b>Universal</b> <b>Access</b> in Human^Computer Interaction. To this effect, the paper revisits the concept of <b>Universal</b> <b>Access,</b> brie£y reviews relevant work on adaptive techniques, and follows their application in efforts to provide accessibility of interactive systems, from the early, product- and environment-level adaptation-based approaches, to more generic solutions oriented towards <b>Universal</b> <b>Access.</b> Finally, the paper highlights {{some of the research}} challenges ahead. The normative perspective of the paper is that adaptive techniques in the context of <b>Universal</b> <b>Access</b> have the potential to facilitate both accessibility and high quality interaction, for the broadest possible end-user population. This implies the design of systems that undertake context-sensitive processing so as to manifest their functional core in alternative interactive embodiments suitable for different users, usage patterns and contexts of use. Such a capability needs to be built into the system from the early phases of conception and design, and subsequently validated throughout its life cycle.
