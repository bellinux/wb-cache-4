5|$|In the past, the Suffolk {{was often}} criticised for its poor feet, having hooves {{that were too}} small for its body mass.

5|$|Oryzomys peninsulae is a {{medium-sized}} {{member of the}} genus, smaller than O.albiventer but larger than O.couesi mexicanus.

5|$|Brownlee's {{impact is}} also felt through the {{organizations}} {{he participated in}} founding: the Alberta Wheat Pool remained an important player in Canadian agriculture until 1998, when it merged with Manitoba Pool Elevators to form Agricore Cooperative Ltd.. In 2001, this new company merged with the UGG to form Agricore United. In 2007, the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool took it over, forming Viterra. Brownlee's vision, <b>unique</b> <b>among</b> {{the members of the}} Macmillan Commission, of a publicly controlled central bank became a reality in 1938, when the Bank of Canada shifted from private to government control.|$|E

5|$|Euryoryzomys emmonsae, {{also known}} as Emmons's Rice Rat or Emmons's oryzomys, is a rodent from the Amazon {{rainforest}} of Brazil in the genus Euryoryzomys of the family Cricetidae. Initially misidentified as E.macconnelli or E.nitidus, it was formally described in 1998. A rainforest species, it may be scansorial, climbing but also spending time on the ground. It occurs only in a limited area south of the Amazon River {{in the state of}} Pará, a distribution that is apparently <b>unique</b> <b>among</b> the muroid rodents of the region.|$|E

Alfred is also <b>unique</b> <b>among</b> their first fourteen children for never being an older sibling while he was alive, as the only child younger than him was born after his death.|$|E
