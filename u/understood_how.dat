5|$|By 1891, Marsh {{published}} a more familiar view of Stegosaurus, {{with a single}} row of plates. This was dropped fairly early on (apparently because it was poorly <b>understood</b> <b>how</b> the plates were embedded in the skin and they were thought to overlap too much in this arrangement). It was revived, in somewhat modified form, in the 1980s, by Stephen Czerkas, based on the arrangement of iguana dorsal spines.|$|E

5|$|Jensen {{was able}} to take on {{production}} of the Tiger because its assembly contract for the Volvo P1800 had recently been cancelled. An additional factor in the decision was that Jensen's chief engineer Kevin Beattie and his assistant Mike Jones had previously worked for Rootes, and <b>understood</b> <b>how</b> the company operated. The first of 14 Jensen-built prototypes were based on the Series IV body shell, which became available at the end of 1963.|$|E

5|$|Alastair Campbell was the Labour Party's Press Secretary and led a {{strategy}} to neutralise {{the influence of the}} press (which had weakened former Labour leader Neil Kinnock) and create allies for the party. While in government, Campbell established a Strategic Communications Unit, a central body whose role was to co-ordinate the party's media relations and ensure that a unified image was presented to the press. Because of his background in tabloid journalism, Campbell <b>understood</b> <b>how</b> different parts of the media would cover stories. He was a valued news source for journalists because he was close to Blair– he was the first press secretary to regularly attend cabinet meetings.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{not fully}} <b>understood</b> <b>how</b> it came to his attention, Rochdale Town Hall was admired by Adolf Hitler. It has been {{suggested}} a visit by Hitler in 1912–13 while staying with his half-brother Alois Hitler, Jr. in Liverpool, or military intelligence on Rochdale, or information from Nazi sympathiser William Joyce (who had lived in Oldham), brought the building to his attention. Hitler admired the architecture {{so much that it}} is believed he wished to ship the building, brick-by-brick, to Nazi Germany had German-occupied Europe encompassed the United Kingdom. Rochdale was broadly avoided by German bombers during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|It is not <b>understood</b> <b>how</b> the {{activated}} RISC complex locates complementary mRNAs {{within the}} cell. Although the cleavage {{process has been}} proposed {{to be linked to}} translation, translation of the mRNA target is not essential for RNAi-mediated degradation. Indeed, RNAi may be more effective against mRNA targets that are not translated. Argonaute proteins are localized to specific regions in the cytoplasm called P-bodies (also cytoplasmic bodies or GW bodies), which are regions with high rates of mRNA decay; miRNA activity is also clustered in P-bodies. Disruption of P-bodies decreases the efficiency of RNA interference, suggesting that they are a critical site in the RNAi process.|$|E

5|$|When The Tower of Babble was {{released}} in April 2012, a little over {{one and a half}} years had elapsed since its author Richard Stursberg left the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), in August 2010. Stursberg had been recruited by CBC president Robert Rabinovitch, as his vice-president in charge of English services. Stursberg had previously worked in the media business, most recently as the director of Telefilm Canada (2001–2004). He entered CBC in October 2004, to replace the retiring Harold Redekopp, with the idea of changing the network's direction, away from its focus on high arts and towards popular content. Though Rabinovitch supported him, Stursberg <b>understood</b> <b>how</b> difficult that transition would be and that he would face resistance and criticism. Stursberg's vision was not supported by Rabinovitch's successor, Hubert Lacroix, who eventually replaced Stursberg with Kirstine Stewart. The 63-year-old Stursberg left CBC in August 2010 and by October 2011 publisher Douglas & McIntyre acquired the world rights to his memoir. Douglas & McIntyre's parent company, D Publishers, filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, still owing Stursberg $13,000.|$|E
5|$|On June 7, 1855, the 183-ft. vessel Benjamin Franklin {{put into}} Hampton Roads for repairs. She had just sailed from the West Indies where {{there had been}} an {{outbreak}} of yellow fever. The port health officer ordered the ship quarantined. After eleven days, a second inspection found no issues, so she was allowed to dock. A few days later, the first cases of yellow fever were discovered in Norfolk, and a machinist died from the disease on July 8. By August, several people were dying per day, and a third of the city's population had fled in the hopes of escaping the epidemic. No one <b>understood</b> <b>how</b> the disease was transmitted. With both Norfolk and Portsmouth being infected, New York banned all traffic from those sites. Neighboring cities also banned residents from Norfolk. The epidemic spread through the city via mosquitoes and poor sanitation, affecting every family and causing widespread panic. The number of infected reached 5,000 in September, and by the second week, 1,500 had died in Norfolk and Portsmouth. As the weather cooled, the outbreak began to wane, leaving a final tally of about 3,200 dead. It took the city some time to recover.|$|E

25|$|What Scott did not realise is a sledge dog, {{if it is}} to do {{the same}} work as a man, will require the same amount of food. Furthermore, when sledge dogs are given {{insufficient}} food they become difficult to handle. The advantage of the sledge dog is its greater mobility. Not only were the Norwegians accustomed to skiing, which enabled them to keep up with their dogs, but they also <b>understood</b> <b>how</b> to feed them and not overwork them.|$|E
25|$|Among the Turkish leaders, the Ottomans {{emerged as}} great power under Osman I {{and his son}} Orhan I. The Anatolian beyliks were {{successively}} absorbed into the rising Ottoman Empire during the 15th century. It is not well <b>understood</b> <b>how</b> the Osmanlı, or Ottoman Turks, came to dominate their neighbours, as the history of medieval Anatolia is still little known. The Ottomans completed the conquest of the peninsula in 1517 with the taking of Halicarnassus (modern Bodrum) from the Knights of Saint John.|$|E

25|$|It {{is poorly}} <b>understood</b> <b>how</b> ANCA are developed, {{although}} several hypotheses have been suggested. There {{is probably a}} genetic contribution, particularly in genes controlling the level of immune response – although genetic susceptibility {{is likely to be}} linked to an environmental factor, some possible factors including vaccination or exposure to silicates. Two possible mechanisms of ANCA development are postulated, although neither of these theories answers the question of how the different ANCA specificities are developed, and there is much research still being undertaken on the development of ANCA.|$|E
25|$|Beatty {{joined the}} Royal Navy as a cadet passing into the {{training}} ship HMS Britannia tenth out of ninety-nine candidates in January 1884. During his {{two years at}} Britannia, moored at Dartmouth, he was beaten three times for various infractions. He passed out of Britannia eighteenth out of the thirty-three remaining cadets {{at the end of}} 1885. Beatty's letters home made no complaint about the poor living conditions in Britannia, and generally he was extrovert, even aggressive, and resented discipline. However, he <b>understood</b> <b>how</b> far he could transgress without serious consequences, and this approach continued throughout his career.|$|E
25|$|He was {{admitted}} to the Protestant European School, like his brothers and sisters, in January 1902. He continued his studies at this school which was run by the Baptist Mission up to 1909 and then shifted to the Ravenshaw Collegiate School. Here, we was ridiculed by his fellow students because he knew very little Bengali. The day Subhas {{was admitted}} to this school, Beni Madhab Das, the headmaster, <b>understood</b> <b>how</b> brilliant and scintillating his genius was.

25|$|Harmful algal blooms (HAB's) of {{dinoflagellates}} or cyanobacteria produce toxic metabolic byproducts that render them noxious to many organisms. Fostered by {{a combination}} of high nutrient concentrations and temperatures, HAB's have a doubly negative affect on the food web by competitively excluding diatoms and microflagellates, further reducing bioavailable primary production. While certain invertebrates such as bivalves may not be directly affected, they may propagate toxins up the food chain, sickening or killing predators. It is not well <b>understood</b> <b>how</b> copepods are affected. The invasive algae Microcystis aeruginosa is now common in the Delta during summer months and may reduce copepod productivity (in addition to being potentially carcinogenic for humans).|$|E
25|$|I do {{not know}} how many men I saw, but {{certainly}} during this one march not less than 5,000. Of this great number two only offered insults to the gang of prisoners....But little and petty as it was it galled horribly. The soldiers felt the sting and scowled back; the officers looked straight before them. Yet it was a valuable lesson. Only a few days before I had read in the newspapers of how the Kaffirs had jeered at the Boer prisoners when they were marched into Pietermaritzburg, saying, 'Where are your passes?' It had seemed a very harmless joke then, but now I <b>understood</b> <b>how</b> a prisoner feels these things.|$|E

But on that expedition, the men had not properly <b>understood</b> <b>how</b> to travel on snow {{with the use of}} dogs. The party had skis but were too inexperienced to make good use of them. As a result, the dogs travelled so fast that the men could not keep up with them. The Discovery expedition had to increase their loads to slow the dogs down. Additionally, the dogs were fed Norwegian dried fish, which did not agree with them and soon they began to deteriorate. The whole team of dogs eventually died (and were eaten), and the men took over hauling the sleds.|$|E
