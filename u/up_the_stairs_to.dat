5|$|William Bell, Seward's butler, {{answered}} the door when Powell knocked slightly after 10p.m. Powell told Bell that he had medicine from Seward's physician, and that his instructions were to personally show Seward how to take it. Overcoming Bell's skepticism, Powell made his way <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> Seward's third-floor bedroom.

Seward, to whom he repeated the medicine story; Frederick, suspicious, said his father was asleep.|$|E
5|$|A book {{published}} in November 2011, Seal Target Geronimo, by Chuck Pfarrer, a former SEAL, contradicted the account {{as given by}} U.S. government sources. According to Pfarrer, neither helicopter crashed {{at the beginning of}} the raid. Instead, the SEALs jumped onto the roof from the hovering Razor 1 helicopter and entered a third-floor hallway from the roof terrace. Osama's third wife, Khairah, was in the hallway, headed towards the SEALs. She was blinded by a strobe light and pushed to the floor as the SEALs went past her. Osama bin Laden stuck his head out of a bedroom door, saw the SEALs, and slammed the door closed. At the same time, Osama's son Khalid bin Laden ran <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> the third floor and was killed with two shots.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, deHavilland {{appeared}} in William Wyler's period drama The Heiress (1949), the fourth {{in a string}} of critically acclaimed performances. After seeing the play on Broadway, deHavilland called Wyler and urged him to fly to New York to see what she felt would be a perfect role for her. Wyler obliged, loved the play, and with deHavilland's help arranged for Paramount to secure the film rights. Adapted for the screen by Ruth and Augustus Goetz and based on the 1880 novel Washington Square by Henry James, the film is about a young naïve woman who {{falls in love with a}} young man, over the objections of her cruel and emotionally abusive father, who suspects the young man of being a fortune seeker. As she had done in Hold Back the Dawn, deHavilland portrayed her character's transformation from a shy, trusting innocent to a guarded, mature woman over a period of years. Her delineation of Catherine Sloper is developed through carefully crafted movements, gestures, and facial expressions that convey a submissive and inhibited young woman. Her timid voice, nervous hands, downcast eyes, and careful movements all communicate what the character is too shy to verbalize. Throughout the production, Wyler pressed deHavilland hard to elicit the requisite visual points of the character. When Catherine returns home after being jilted, the director had the actress carry a suitcase filled with heavy books <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> convey the weight of Catherine's trauma physically instead of using a planned speech in the original script. The Heiress was released in October 1949 and was well received by critics. For her performance, she received the New York Film Critics Award, the Golden Globe Award, and the Academy Award for Best Actressher second Oscar.|$|E

25|$|Legere {{was convicted}} {{in the murder of}} shopkeeper John Glendenning, of Black River Bridge, New Brunswick, which {{occurred}} on the evening of June 21, 1986. After cutting the power, Legere and his accomplices Todd Matchett and Scott Curtis, broke into the elderly couple's store. After repeatedly beating John and his wife Mary, the trio fled the scene. Mary then discovered her husband (who had been beaten to death); she crawled <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> the phone and dialed 911. The dispatcher spoke with Mary on the phone until the emergency forces arrived. Police tracked down the three and arrested them. Matchett pleaded guilty to murdering John Glendenning and brutally beating his wife Mary; Curtis and Legere were convicted at trial.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the motive}} for killing Alfred, and the method of his murder, were changed - Alfred had spotted Quimper {{planting}} a false clue {{on the grounds of}} the Hall, knowing that the body of his wife would be found eventually. When Alexander and James find it and show it to the family, Alfred suspected Quimper was up to something and decided to blackmail him, boasting to Lucy just before dinner that he was due to receive money. When the family fall ill at dinner by a small dose of arsenic, Alfred, weakened as a result, is later killed in his bed by a fatal injection from Quimper; as he is being killed, Alfred cried out his killer's name, which Quimper made certain was misconstrued as him calling for the doctor's help, shortly after appearing to have run back <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> Alfred's bedroom when Emma rushed out to the commotion being created.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} is {{situated at the}} back of the Saw Plaza. The exterior queue line consists of mock razor wire fences and various large torture implements rusting on the ground (most of which come from the films). Walkie talkie announcements are heard from policemen inside the building, often sounding as if they are panicking. Loud ambient music is played throughout the area. The queue travels around the back of the warehouse and then into the building itself. Inside, riders walk through a dimly lit corridor, with four shotguns hanging from the ceiling. The guns 'fire' every few minutes to give a jump effect. The corridor leads up some stairs past a cage with a trap (the Rack from Saw III) seen in it. On special occasions, live actors are placed in this cage and act as Jigsaw's victims. Travelling up the stairs, Billy the Puppet can be seen and heard on TV monitors <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> the station. Above the queue, a body is seen tangled in barbed wire (referencing the first Saw), before the queue goes into the station. In here, mannequin parts are fixed in various small devices or hanging from the walls, and misted windows flash on the wall opposite the queue.|$|E

Eyewitness Rochus Misch reported someone shouting, [...] "Hurry upstairs, they're burning the boss!" [...] After the first attempts to ignite the petrol did not work, Linge went back inside the bunker and returned with a thick roll of papers. Bormann lit the papers and threw the torch onto the bodies. As the two corpses caught fire, a small group, including Bormann, Günsche, Linge, Goebbels, Erich Kempka, Peter Högl, Ewald Lindloff, and Hans Reisser, raised their arms in salute as they stood just inside the bunker doorway.|$|E

Other clips show the bridesmaids waving, the bride getting onto them while the groom is clapping and the groom running off with Swift. According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV.com, the performance is [...] "a very theatrical moment" [...] in which [...] "Swift acted out crashing a wedding. She eventually stole the groom away, as she sings in the song, and the pair ran through the crowd together." ...|$|E

[...] In a second letter she offered to supply quotations from Quimby's [...] "theory of Christ (not Jesus)." [...] Between then and May 1864, Eddy returned to see Quimby several times, staying for weeks in Portland and visiting him daily. She wrote to him regularly, and composed a sonnet for him, [...] "Mid light of science sits the sage profound." ...|$|E

In spite of the heat of the room, he wore a thick sea-jacket, buttoned to the neck, and a tall hairy cap drawn down over his ears; yet I never saw any man, not even a judge upon the bench, look cooler, or more studious and self-possessed, than this ship-captain.|$|R

500|$|One of {{the most}} notorious and widely {{condemned}} scenes in Gone with the Wind depicts what is now legally defined as [...] "marital rape". The scene begins with Scarlett and Rhett {{at the bottom of the}} staircase, where he begins to kiss her, refusing to be told 'no' by the struggling and frightened Scarlett; Rhett overcomes her resistance and carries her <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> the bedroom, where the audience is left in no doubt that she will [...] "get what's coming to her". The next scene, the following morning, shows Scarlett glowing with barely suppressed sexual satisfaction; Rhett apologizes for his behavior, blaming it on his drinking. The scene has been accused of combining romance and rape by making them indistinguishable from each other, and of reinforcing a notion about forced sex: that women secretly enjoy it, and it is an acceptable way for a man to treat his wife.|$|E
500|$|Afterwards, Goebbels and {{his wife}} went <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> ground level and through the Führerbunker's {{emergency}} exit to the bombed-out garden behind the Reich Chancellery. There are several different accounts on what followed. According to one account, Goebbels shot his wife and then himself. Another account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule and were given a coup de grâce immediately afterwards by Goebbels' SS adjutant, Günther Schwägermann. Schwägermann testified in 1948 that the couple walked ahead of him {{up the stairs and}} out into the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard the [...] "shots" [...] sound. Schwägermann then walked up the remaining stairs and outside. There he saw the lifeless bodies of the couple. Following Joseph Goebbels' prior order, Schwägermann told an SS soldier to make sure Goebbels' was dead. The soldier fired into Goebbels' body, which did not move. The bodies were then doused with petrol, but the remains were only partially burned and not buried.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Abby West {{focused on}} Carell's acting, {{explaining}} that [...] "the way that Michael's desire to boast and his healthy fear of offending Jan {{played out on}} Steve Carell's face was fantastic. From his braggadocio {{on the phone with}} Todd Packer (Packer!) to his death march <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> face Jan, it was a thing of beauty." [...] BuddyTV's Oscar Dahl believed that [...] "Back from Vacation" [...] was [...] "one of the two or three best of the season", opining that [...] "simplicity" [...] was the key to the series' success. Dahl continued, [...] "Each episode's premise can be entirely mundane and inconsequential. It will still mine laughs from the situation at hand. We also had some nice development in the Jim-Pam-Karen triangle, with Pam giving Jim relationship advice, then bawling her eyes out afterwards. Maybe the best scene in the episode saw Dwight comfort her." [...] Television Without Pity graded the episode with an A.|$|E

500|$|Rettenmund had a {{different}} interpretation of the video, calling it as a [...] "subtly orchestrated story of the singer's addiction to—and almost spiritual deliverance from—heroin". He found contrast in Madonna's white blonde character—with hyper-glamor, heavy mascara, pierced nose and navel, a clingy blouse and vintage high heels—to the neighborhood of Harlem, where Madonna is portrayed as a [...] "Billie Holiday-esque singer in the jazz club". At {{the end of the}} video, Madonna climbs <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> her lover's room, Rettenmund found references to the music videos for the singles [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] (1984) and [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] (1986), both of which had the singer climbing the stairs but never reaching the destination, unlike [...] "Secret". Rettenmund also observed that [...] "Secret" [...] could serve as a follow-up to the music video for [...] "Borderline" [...] with the events happening ten years and Madonna all grownup. He concluded by saying that in lieu of the singer's 1994 interview with The Face magazine, where she expressed her desire to have a family, the video emphasized on Madonna's interest in a partner and a child.|$|E
500|$|Exterior {{shots of}} the Luthor Mansion were shot at the Hatley Castle in Victoria, two hours west of Vancouver by ferry. Time {{constraints}} forced scenes, which were shot from multiple angles, to sometimes be shot at separate locations. A scene involving Whitney (Eric Johnson) and Lana (Kristin Kreuk) sitting on her porch was shot at two different locations. Close-ups of Whitney were shot under a football stadium, while close-ups of Lana were shot in a potato-processing factory. Unable to shoot at the house being used as the Lang residence, the crew built Lana's front porch inside a sewage processing facility for the final scene of the episode where Lana walks <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> her house. The local sewage treatment facility is also {{the site for the}} LuthorCorp pesticide plant, which Lex was sent to Smallville to manage. The crash site of Clark's ship was shot at the sandpits where Mission to Mars was filmed. Smallville's Main Street was filmed in both the town of Merritt, which is three hours east of Vancouver, and in the town of Cloverdale. Most of the filming took place in Cloverdale, since the town had a long stretch of vacant buildings that could double as Smallville's Main Street. When the production crew came to film the opening teaser, they had to decorate the town with ribbons and balloons, as well as paint some of the buildings to attain Millar's idea of [...] "Smalltown, USA". Two sets were built just for the pilot. The Kent storm cellar was built as a cover set inside the farm's barn. For the cemetery scene between Clark and Lana, production designer Bernard Hides built the entire cemetery from scratch in an empty field.|$|E
