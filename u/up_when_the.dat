5|$|For comparison, its {{population}} was only 20,000 in 1969 and 150,000 in 1980.

Some estimates put the 2008 population at over 2 million, estimated to be close to one-third of the country's population. The 2013 census gave the city's population as 958,399.|$|E

When the 2nd New Zealand Division was formed in 1940, he was promoted to brigadier and appointed commander of its 6th Infantry Brigade. Embarking from New Zealand in May 1940, he spent the next four months in England, commanding elements of the 2nd New Zealand Division which had been diverted there while en route to the Middle East, his own brigade continuing to Egypt as planned.|$|E

5|$|Daun's {{battle plan}} took the Prussians {{completely}} by surprise. The {{east side of}} Frederick's line {{was the first to}} be attacked. Using the starless night and fog as cover, and grouped into small shock units for easier control and stealth, the Austrians fell on the Prussian battery when the church bell signaled 5:00, catching the Prussians completely off guard. Many men were still sleeping, or just waking <b>up,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> attack started. After setting fire to the village, the Croats cut tent ropes, causing the canvas to fall on sleeping soldiers, then bayoneted the men as they struggled to free themselves from canvas and cords. Men tangled in the tents bled to death, in what today is still called Blutgasse, or Blood Alley.|$|E

5|$|Montfort's {{success was}} illusory, however. The {{terms of the}} Peace of Canterbury were {{rejected}} by a papal legate in negotiations at Boulogne. Meanwhile, the Marcher lords did not leave the country, and remained a thorn {{in the side of}} the regime. The triumvirate at the head of government broke <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Earl of Gloucester defected to the royalist side. In May, Edward was able to escape captivity, with Gloucester's help. Edward started on a campaign of re-conquest, while Montfort was forced to suppress a rebellion in the Marches. He succeeded only by making large concessions to Llewelyn, and then moved east to join forces with his son Simon. Edward, however, routed the younger Simon at Kenilworth Castle. On 4 August 1265 Montfort found himself trapped at Evesham, forced to give battle with a much smaller army than the royals. The battle soon turned into a massacre; Montfort himself was killed and mutilated on the field. Even with Montfort dead resistance remained, particularly at the virtually impregnable Kenilworth Castle. In October 1266 the Dictum of Kenilworth set down terms by which the rebels could obtain pardons, and by the end of the year the garrison surrendered.|$|E

The ship transported emergency supplies to Belgium and the Netherlands immediately afterwards. At the end of 1945, Garland took part in Operation Deadlight, the scuttling of captured German U-boats. In early 1946, the ship patrolled Norwegian waters and then {{was assigned to the}} Polish Squadron at Rosyth through June. In late July she was ordered to be paid off and the loan terminated.

5|$|Smart Covers are screen protectors that magnetically attach and align to {{the face}} of the iPad 2, 3, or 4. The cover has three folds which allow it to convert into a stand, which is also held {{together}} by magnets. While original iPad owners could purchase a black case that included a similarly folding cover, the Smart Cover is meant to be more minimal, easily detachable, and protects only the screen. Smart Covers have a microfiber bottom that cleans the front of the iPad (which wakes <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> cover is removed). There are five different colors of both polyurethane and leather, with leather being more expensive. Smart Covers are not compatible with the original iPad. In June 2012, Apple started selling the Smart Case - a case with the combined function of a smart cover and a back protection case which is compatible with the iPad 2, and iPad 3rd & 4th generation devices.|$|E
