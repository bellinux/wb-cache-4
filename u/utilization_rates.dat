Additionally unusual for Skybus flight crew was that there were very few if any overnight trips thus giving the crew far fewer hours away from home (known as TAFB or time away from base) and higher crew <b>utilization</b> <b>rates</b> for more efficient work schedules. Typical Skybus pilot workdays were 8–10 hours long (FAA maximum is 16 hours), which was lower than the industry average of 12–14 hours. Typical pilot work months were 14–15 days with no overnights. The average pilot in the US has a work month of 16–17 days, and the average airline pilot wage is approximately $135,000 averaged between first officer and captain pay.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBased on {{simulations}} of the transports of a typically formed Chinese intercity passenger train hauled respectively by major types of the locomotives {{on a certain}} railway line in China, this research analyzes the changes of the traction energy cost intensity and passenger transport efficiency of the train with varying its passenger capacity <b>utilization</b> <b>rate</b> and target speed. It is found that if the passenger capacity <b>utilization</b> <b>rate</b> of such a train is higher than 60. 00 %, the effect of its passenger capacity <b>utilization</b> <b>rate</b> and target speed on its traction energy cost intensity and passenger transport efficiency is relatively very small. In contrast, if the passenger capacity <b>utilization</b> <b>rate</b> of the train is reduced from 40. 00 %, the efficiencies of its traction energy cost and passenger transport both decrease obviously and such decreases are evidently affected by its target speed. Therefore, strictly preventing the passenger capacity <b>utilization</b> <b>rate</b> of a conventional intercity passenger train from decreasing from 40. 00 % in particular and meanwhile striving to make its passenger capacity <b>utilization</b> <b>rate</b> higher than 60. 00 % as new evaluation benchmarking are able to effectively improve the railway passenger transport operation management in China...|$|R
30|$|The <b>utilization</b> <b>rate</b> of {{distribution}} network equipment {{is closely related}} to the economy {{of distribution}} network construction. It depends on the load rate, burden rate and life expectancy rate of the equipment. Intelligent power consumption technologies {{play a significant role in}} improving the <b>utilization</b> <b>rate</b> of distribution network equipment which can reduce the construction and investment cost of distribution networks. The influence of intelligent power consumption technologies on the <b>utilization</b> <b>rate</b> of distribution network equipment is affected by a variety of factors. The key to improve the <b>utilization</b> <b>rate</b> of equipment is to take the problems of supply side and demand side into consideration comprehensively, and to make use of the intelligent power consumption technologies rationally. The corresponding evaluation indexes and their application scope are described in this paper, and the influences of intelligent power equipment with energy storage function, V 2 G technology and TOU tariff on the <b>utilization</b> <b>rate</b> of distribution network equipment have also been reviewed.|$|R
