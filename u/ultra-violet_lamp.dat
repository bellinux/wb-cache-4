After the discovery, it crossed a period of intense exploration activity, including diamond drilling and some preliminary engineering, until the ´80s when it was decided to carry out a pre-feasibility study of the prospect. By 1985, however, with a prevailing tungsten price of US$81/mtu, the project was considered non-viable.

40|$|Traditionally, {{positive}} transparencies for photogravure {{intaglio printing}} and negative transparencies for platinum and carbon-tissue transfer printing were produced from photographic film, providing continuous tone images of great detail, tonality and delicacy. Some {{of the finest}} photographic images {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth century were printed using these processes and over the last decade an increasing number of artists have been attracted to the expressive possibilities of these techniques. Choice of film stock for the production of the necessary transparencies has become much more limited over recent years and digitally produced negatives and positives from image-setters and ink-jet printers are increasingly favoured. The production of transparencies of a modest quality using ink-jet printers and commercially available acetate film is not difficult. However, comprehensive calibration routines are necessary if full control over tonal gradation and print contrast is to be secured, especially in the highlight and shadow areas. Each type of photosensitive coating/process responds differently to the type and spectrum emissions of <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>lamp</b> used for exposure and to the nature of the transparency substrate and the colour/composition of the ink-jet printer inks. The ink colour and UV absorbance of the negative transparency, or positive in the case of photogravure, can be varied to give enhanced control over reflectance density, tonal gradation and micro-contrast in the final print. This illustrated talk will compare different techniques for the production of and calibration of ink-jet transparencies and the requirements for control of tonal gradation and contrast in respect of platinum, photogravure, carbon transfer and other photographic contact printing processes. The talk is complemented by a conference exhibition of some of Peter Moseley’s photogravure portraits...|$|E

50|$|Kurt Huldschinsky (born 1883 in Berlin; died 15 December 1940 in Alexandria, Egypt) was a German Pediatrician of Polish {{heritage}} (Prussian). He {{served in}} the Wehrmacht as a field medic in World War I. Later, as a medical doctor and research scientist, he successfully demonstrated {{in the winter of}} 1918/1919 how rickets could be treated with <b>Ultra-violet</b> <b>lamps.</b> At that time perhaps half of all German children suffered from rickets. It was already understood that this disease was caused by Calcium deficiency. Up to that point, heliotherapy was a common protocol for many illnesses and showed promise in relieving the effects of rickets. The bio-chemical mechanism triggered in the human dermis by the sun's electromagnetic radiation was not fully understood, and scientists were exploring mostly the long wavelength (red) end of the spectrum. To generate artificial UV, Dr. Huldschinsky originally tried to adapt existing X-Ray technology.|$|R
40|$|A {{quasi-experimental}} {{study using}} a pretest-posttest design with {{a control group}} {{was used to evaluate}} the effects of a simplified 5 -step multimedia visualization hand hygiene improvement program by schoolchildren with mild intellectual disability (MID). A total of twenty schoolchildren aged 6 - 12 years old with MID (12 males) were recruited and they were assigned into intervention (n = 10) and control (n = 10) groups. To evaluate the quality of their hand washing, Glow gel, which contains plastic simulated germs that are visible under an <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>lamp,</b> was applied to participants' hands to assess the quality of hand washing by comparing the amount of visible Glow gel before and after hand washing using a 4 -point scale. Four raters used this 4 -point scale to assess the quality of hand washing through digital photo images of the participants' hands. A total of eight digital photos per participant were taken. A fifteen-minute hand washing training session was conducted every school day for 4 weeks for the intervention group. Those in the control group received no training. A multimedia visual package on steps of hand washing was presented together with a reward system, whereby a number of stars were earned each week depending on the quality of hand washing. Results showed encouraging findings, as the schoolchildren in the intervention group showed significant improvement in hand washing (p < 0. 001) and the improvement was stronger than that of the control group (p = 0. 02). To conclude, a systematic instruction emphasizing multimedia visualization in a hand washing improvement program can be successfully implemented in a special school, and the effect of integrating multimedia visuals in the hand hygiene program could improve hand hygiene among schoolchildren with MID.

40|$|A new fluorometric {{method is}} presented, {{based on data}} showing a linear {{relationship}} between CTC concentration and intensity of fluorescence of aluminum-CTC chelate, and little interference due to presence of decomposition products of CTC. A fairly good agreement was obtained between CTC values assayed by the microbiologic method and those by the proposed fluorometric method. Moreover, this method can be employed for field assay of CTC concentration in ice (Figs. 1, 2, and Tables 1, 3). A precise determination by using Beckman spectrophotometer : To a 10 cc aliquot of sample and each of standard solution series (1 - 5 mcg per cc) and 1 cc of a 1 % potassium alum (KA 1 (SO_ 4) _ 2 ? 12 H_ 2 O) solution in M/ 2 acetate buffer of pH 4. 6. Allow it to stand for 20 to 60 minutes at room temperature. Measure the fluorescence at a wave length of 500 mu of the sample when irradiated by an excitation light of 365 mu or 436 mu. Measure likewise the fluorescence {{of a series of}} standard solutions added with the alum reagent. Subtract the blank value from each measured intensity of fluorescence, and prepare a standard curve by plotting the intensity against the concentration of CTC. By employing this standard curve find the CTC concentration of the sample solution corresponding to its intensity of fluorescence which is corrected for the blank value. Approximate determination : The following methods are developed for the field work. (1) Test tube method : Place 10 cc of a supernatant of a thawed ice sample in a flat bottom test tube of equal diameter (about 27 mm), and add 1 cc of the alum reagent. After allowing it to stand for 5 to 10 minutes, observe the fluorescence {{from the top of the}} tubes irradiated with the black ray lamp from the side. Estimate CTC concentration of the ice sample by comparing the fluorescence of the sample with those of the standard series treated in the same way as the sample. (2) Portable nephelo-colorimeter method : Add a 1 cc aliquot of the alum reagent to both a 10 cc aliquot of supernatant of a thawed sample and a standard solution (4 or 2 mcg/cc depending on CTC content of sample). After allowing them to stand for 10 minutes, place the sample in one of the comparison tube (A) and the standard in the other tube (B), set the bottom of the inner tube for the tube (B) at a depth of 30 mm and by evenly irradiating with the long wave <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>lamp</b> and matching the intensity for tube (A) against that for tube (B), find the reading, h, for tube (A) where the intensity of the sample is identical with that of the standard. The content of CTC (mcg/cc) can be calculated by a formula, S× 30 /h, where S is the CTC concentration of the standard solution employed. サリチル酸およびサリチル酸アミドのような螢光性有機物はアルカリ,アルカリ土類および稀土類などの金属と酷塩をつくつて,発螢光性が強くなる. 一方CTCはMgCl_ 2 およびCaCl_ 2 の溶液中で黄色の螢光を発し,またCa, Mgのような金属とキレート化合物をつくることが知られている. 因つて著者はCTCのある種の金属キレート化合物は強い螢光を発するのではないかと想像し,分光光度計を用いてまず種々の金属イオンによる螢光度の差異をみたところ,アルミニウムイオンの存在によつてCTCの螢光が最も強くなることを見出したので,定量法の決定に必要な種々の条件を検討し一新定量法を決定することができた...|$|E

40|$|An annular photo-reactor was {{designed}} to investigate precursors and mechanisms thought to promote the fouling of <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>lamps</b> in wastewater disinfection systems. Parameters investigated included temperature of the fouling surface (quartz sleeve) and average fluence applied to the wastewater under irradiation. The reactor {{was designed}} to independently control and monitor variations of these parameters. For experimentation, these parameters were manipulated individually and in various combinations {{to be able to}} separate those factor(s) that could affect the fouling potential of the system. The compact and mobile unit utilized a standard low-pressure mercury UV lamp surrounded by two concentric sleeves. The annulus immediately surrounding the lamp was used to control temperature (10 [...] 50 °C) and fluence (10 [...] 100 mJ/cm 2 using a chemical transmission filter) emitted by the lamp. The outer annulus was used for the passage and irradiation of wastewater flowing at 10 [...] 12 L/min (Re ≅ 1, 000). A quartz sleeve separated these annuli. Hydraulic and heat transfer properties of the unit were fully characterized, and the stability of system operations was confirmed. Optimal lamp UV output approached 3 mW/cm 2 and maximum skin temperatures were 45 °C. A cupric sulfate solution (0 [...] 2 g/L) in distilled water was determined to be the most stable transmission filter. Application of temperature and fluence control revealed that both parameters influenced the disinfection potential of the unit (achieving 1 [...] 4 log reduction of fecal coliforms). Collimated beam tests and Point Source Summation computations were used to model fluence distributions within the reactor...|$|R
40|$|Initiation of pitting of {{mild steel}} in {{seawater}} usually {{is attributed to}} anode-cathode reactions {{set up by the}} small manganese sulphide (MnS) inclusions present in most steels. On the other hand there is now considerable evidence that microbiological factors are involved in the early corrosion of mild steel in natural seawater. Presented herein are the results of a two year investigation of whether microbiological factors are likely to have {{a significant role in the}} pitting of mild steel exposed to seawater. In the experiment, natural seawater was pumped from a Port Stephens tributary and split into two streams. One stream flowed slowly through a tank in which 25 mm x 25 mm polished steel coupons were suspended and was then released back to the estuary. The second stream was passed through a series of filters and sterilized using <b>ultra-violet</b> (UV) <b>lamps</b> prior to entering a similar but sealed tank, also fitted with UV sterilization, where identical coupons were suspended, before being returned to the estuary. Coupons were removed at various time intervals and examined both visually and using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In all cases the metal surfaces show a considerable difference in topography between those recovered from natural and those from sterilised seawater. Since the only significant difference between the exposure conditions was the removal of living microbiological material it is concluded that microbiological factors are responsible, directly or indirectly, for the more severe pitting observed on the coupons exposed to natural seawater...|$|R
40|$|It is {{the general}} {{practice}} in Ogbomoso township, Oyo State, Nigeria, to construct hand-dug wells in residential plots of land to serve as reliable source of water supply. Most of these wells, due to constraints imposed {{by the size of}} the plots, are sited adjacent to septic tanks and soak-away pits inside or outside the compounds. The implication of this is that a sizable percentage of the indigent residents exposed to contaminated water are largely responsible for the prevalence of water-borne diseases in the township. To stemthis menace on the short run, a simple and affordable preliminary Household Water Purifier System (HWPS) was designed and constructed. This purification system consists of composite filters (containing: sand, gravel and activated carbon), cartridges, as well as <b>Ultra-Violet</b> (UV) <b>Lamp.</b> Raw water samples (well water) were pumped into the system through Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) pipes. Water samples from both the source and the outlet (purified water) were collected and then taken to the laboratory for physical, chemical and bacteriological analyses. The results from the tests were compared to Nigerian Industrial Standards (NIS) drinking water guidelines. It was observed that the HWPS was able to reduce to permissible levels physical contaminants, as well as most of the regularly checked chemical and bacteriological contaminants. It was observed that theHWPS filter media (aggregates, anthracite etc.) turned to a culture medium for bacteria growth when left for few weeks of inactivity. Conclusively, a number of challenges were identified, and the need for further research work on the HWPS was discovered...|$|R
40|$|Here chemosensor {{materials}} of trinuclear copper(I) pyrazolate complexes {{have been successfully}} synthesized and isolated using two types of 3, 5 -dimethyl and 4 -(3, 5 -dimethoxybenzyl) - 3, 5 -dimethyl pyrazole ligands. Upon excitation at 280 nm, the resulting trinuclear 3, 5 -dimethyl copper(I) pyrazolate complex (complex A) and trinuclear 4 -(3, 5 -dimethoxybenzyl) copper(I) pyrazolate complex (complex B) showed emission bands centered at 590 and 604 nm, respectively. These results were in good agreement with their greenish-white powders and it is characteristic of phosphorescent metal complexes from the weak Cu(I) -Cu(I) metallophilic interaction. Upon direct or stepwise exposure to ethanol vapor with series of concentrations (12. 5, 25, 50, 100, 150 and 200 μL in 22 mg of chemosensor), the emission of chemosensor complex A was not shifted even after 1 d. Interestingly, chemosensor complex B showed gradually changes in both emission band with shifting from 602 to 552 nm and color with changing from orange to green under <b>Ultra-violet</b> (UV) hand <b>lamp</b> (254 nm) at the dark room due to the attachment of benzyl ring to the pyrazole ligand.

40|$|Lanthanide compounds, {{specifically}} those containing europium and terbium can exhibit luminescent properties {{when combined}} with ligands that promote this characteristic. Lanthanide luminescence has proven to have an array of useful applications, {{one of which is}} the formation of luminescent powders for exposure of latent fingerprints. The aim {{of this study was to}} synthesise a novel ligand to support luminescent character in europium and terbium compounds, and then dope these compounds in to talcum powder. This resulting powder would ideally give exposure of latent fingerprints that can then be enhanced, through excitation of the luminescent compounds dispersed in the powder. A novel (Me) ₃CN(CH₂P(O) Ph₂) ₂ ligand (p=o) was synthesised, and in turn was used to synthesis a range of Ln(β‐diketonate) ₃(p=o) compounds. These compounds were assessed for potential luminescent activity, and doped into talcum powder. These powders were then appraised for their prospective use as latent fingerprint exposing agents. Through modification of a published procedure, the (Me) ₃CN(CH₂P(O) Ph₂) ₂ ligand was synthesised, and characterised by Electrospray Ionisation (ESI) Mass spectrometry, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, Infra‐red (IR) spectroscopy, melting point analysis and elemental analysis. With β‐diketonate ligands acetylacetone (acac) and thenoyltrifluoroacetone (tta), lanthanide metals lanthanum, europium and terbium and the (p=o) ligands a series of novel compounds were synthesised (Ln(β‐diketonate) ₃(p=o)). These compounds were characterised by the methods listed above. Using the neutral ligands 1, 10 ‐phenanthroline (phen) and 2, 2 ‐bipyridine (bipy), a series of Eu/Tb(acac/tta) ₃(phen/bipy) compounds were synthesised and doped into talcum powder, to investigate the effects on particle and structure character of the doped talcum powders. Talcum powder was also sonicated to investigate the effect of this on particle size, along with effect on use as a fingerprinting agent. Laser diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy studies informed of a notable decrease in particle size with sonication, and an increase in specific surface area. However the effect of this process on increasing exposure of latent fingerprints was deemed too insignificant to justify the procedure. The compounds Eu/Tb(acac/tta) ₃(phen/bipy), (Eu/Tb(β‐diketonate) ₃(p=o) and [H₂NMe₂]₃[Eu/Tb(2, 6 ‐dpa) ₃]. 2 H₂O were investigated for luminescent activity. Fluorescence spectroscopy determined the dominant emission wavelengths from 254 nm and 312 nm excitation were at 510 nm and 625 nm respectively. The talcum powders, doped with the luminescent compounds were analysed for luminescent activity. Direct screening with an <b>ultra‐violet</b> (UV) <b>lamp</b> with emission wavelengths of 254 nm and 312 nm informed of the powders with the most intensely observed luminescent emissions. From these results, Eu(tta) ₃(p=o), H₂NMe₂]₃[Eu(2, 6 ‐ dpa) ₃]. 2 H₂O, Tb(acac) ₃(p=o) and H₂NMe₂]₃[Tb(2, 6 ‐dpa) ₃]. 2 H₂O were chosen as the most promising candidates for more in‐depth investigation of latent fingerprint exposure potential. Furthermore, it was determined that the novel (Me) ₃CN(CH₂P(O) Ph₂) ₂ ligand was successful as a neutral ligand for supporting luminescence. The powders were trialled by several variables, including surface, powder quantity, age of latent print, temperature, and the brush used to determine their effectiveness. Powders were compared to commercial Greenwop and Redwop fingerprint powders, as these were the most similar industrial samples in terms of use. Through trials in the laboratory and the police fingerprinting laboratory, it was determined that the doped talcum powders were inferior to the commercial “wop” samples in terms of latent print definition under UV conditions. However, the talcum powders had several useful applications, specifically the dual effect of exposing prints clearly under UV and non‐UV conditions. It was concluded the best application for the fingerprint powders was on smooth surfaces such as glass, with a gradual application of powder. Small amounts of powder gave more clarity under non‐UV print exposure, but higher quantities of powder were required to get ample luminescent intensity under UV conditions...|$|R
