40|$|A great {{majority}} of the newer synthetic local anesthetics are are p-amino benzoates of suitable alcohols. In view of the struc-tural similarity between phenyl carbamic acid esters (I) and p-amino benzoic acid esters (II), it is surprising that the field of (I) C 6 H 5 NHCOO-(II) NH 2 C 6 H 1 COO-phenylurethans has been so poorly investigated from the stand-point of the determination of their local anesthetic properties. This is perhaps due to the rather unsatisfactory properties of the <b>urethans</b> studied by Fromherz (1) and Bonar and Soilman (2). The only other references for this type of compound are found in patents, which do not give any data on pharmacological proper-ties (3). The writer has previously shown that one of these patents which purports to descnie the mono-phenylurethan of diethylamino propandiol is in error (4).

40|$|Investigated complex fluids {{comprised}} polymer-surfactant-mixtures (PTMs) and oil-in-water (o/w) -emulsions. The {{mechanical properties}} were probed by oscillatory and continuous flow rheometry, microstructures of emulsions {{were evaluated by}} optical microscopy while droplet size and droplet size distribution were studied by flow particle image analysis (FPIA). 0. 3 - 4. 0 wt% of hydrophobically modified (hm) -(acrylic acid) copolymers and hm-(poly) <b>urethans</b> were combined with 0. 0 - 2. 0 wt% low molecular surfactant (sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) - anionic, cetyltrimethylammonium-bromide (CTAB) - cationic, ethoxylated fatty alcohol (Arylpon F, Dehydol LS 9. 5) - nonionic). The resulting PTMs revealed different polymer-surfactant interactions, due to surfactant / polymer charge and structure. In case of nonionic surfactants and SDS, polymer-surfactant interactions resulted in {{a more or less}} pronounced "thin-to-thick"-effect of PTMs depending on surfactant concentration and structure, whereas in CTAB-PTMs thickening as well as phase separation were observed depending on CTAB concentration. For PTMs from 1. 0 wt% crosslinked polymer and surfactants an uncommon second shear thinning region, which is not mentioned in the literature so far, region was observed in the flow curves, which could be related to shear induced structural changes. The investigations on PTMs gave basic understanding of a possible applicability of polymeric thickeners in emulsions. Because low molecular surfactants showed some disadvantages in emulsions, only polymeric stabilized emulsions were investigated which contain silicon-based polymeric emulsifiers (dimethicones). Rheological properties and microstructures of polymer stabilized emulsions were compared to properties of classic emulsions with low molecular emulsifiers as stabilizing components. The investigations concerning rheological properties and droplet size of emulsions, presented here, dealt with o/w-emulsions containing polymeric thickener Pemulen TR- 1 (TR- 1) and silicone based emulsifier (DC 193). By varying thickener and emulsifier content rheological properties and droplet size of emulsions changed significantly. Experimental results and a statistical analysis showed that the physical network, build up by TR- 1 in a concentration range from 0. 1 - 1. 0 wt%, was the dominating factor for rheological properties and increased moduli and viscosity of emulsions. The development of droplet diameters revealed that a systematic control of droplet parameters was possible by increasing the DC 193 concentration from 0. 0 - 5. 0 wt%. In contrast, increasing TR- 1 concentration led to either large or small droplets. The influence of larger droplets in the emulsions was revealed when the arithmetic diameter and the Sauter diameter were compared and displayed huge differences. These differences resulted from a rather small amount of big droplets with diameters above 40 micrometer, which could be seen in the droplet size distributions of emulsions. An influence of oil droplets on emulsion elasticity was only observed for emulsions with low TR- 1 concentration (~ 0. 1 wt%), because at higher concentrations the influence of oil droplets was superimposed by thickening properties of TR- 1...|$|R

40|$|Ziel dieser Arbeit war es die Tandem-Wittig- 1, 3 -dipolare Cycloaddition auf a-Hydroxyurethanderivate zu übertragen und so chirale, nichtracemische b-Amino-piperidylacetatderivaten in möglichst hoher Diastereomerenreinheit darzustellen. Diese Aminopiperidinderivate sollten mit 5 -Chloro- 2 -methoxy- 4 -methylamino-benzoesäure gekoppelt werden, um die pharmakologische Wirksamkeit zu testen. Als Ausgangssubstanz wurde L-Pyroglutaminsäure (59) verwendet. Über eine dreistufige literaturbekannte Synthese wurden die beiden Halogenpyrrolidinon-derivate 62 und 63 hergestellt. Diese wurden über SN 2 -Reaktionen mit Natriumazid zu dem Azidopyrrolidinon 64 umgesetzt und durch die Einführung einer Boc-Schutzgruppe in die Verbindung 65 überführt. Die Hydroxyurethanderivate 66 erhält man auf zwei unterschiedlichen Wegen. Zum einen auf dem direkten Weg über eine DiBAl-H-Reduktion von 65 und zum anderen über eine Ringöffnung von 65 mit Natriummethanolat zu 68 und anschließender DiBAl-H-Reduktion. Mit 66 wurden das erste Mal a-Hydroxyurethanderivate einer Tandem Wittig 1, 3 -dipolaren Cycloaddition unterworfen. Man erhielt unter Essigsäurekatalyse ein Produktgemisch aus dem a,b-ungesättigten Ester 74, dem Triazolin 75 und dem Diazoester 76. Der isolierte a,b-ungesättigte Ester 74 konnte teilweise unter Essigsäaurekatalyse erneut zu den Cycloadditionsprodukten umgesetzt werden. Die Gleichgewichtseinstellung zwischen dem Triazolin 75 und dem Diazoester 76 konnte mit Triethylamin zugunsten des Diazoesters 76 verändert werden. Die Wittigreaktion verläuft unter thermodynamischer Kontrolle stereoselektiv zum E-konfigurierten a,b-ungesättigtem Ester 74. Auch die 1, 3 -dipolare Cycloaddition verläuft in einem äußerst hohem Maße diastereoselektiv. Durch 1 H-NMR-spektroskopische Untersuchungen konnte man die Konfiguration der Cycloadditionsprodukte mit trans bestimmen. Eine Erklärung für die Stereoselektivität der 1, 3 -dipolaren Cycloaddition liefert die Betrachtung der sterischen und elektronischen Eigenschaften zweier hypothetischer sesselförmiger Konformere des a,b-ungesättigten Esters 74. Über eine katalytische Hydrierung des Diazoesters 76 konnte man einen sehr guten Zugang zu den trans-konfigurierten Piperidylacetaten 2 R- 78 etablieren. Das andere Diastereomer 2 S- 78 sollte nach Stickstoffextrusion aus 76 durch diastereoselektive Hydrierung des vinylogen <b>Urethans</b> 80 erhalten werden. Überraschenderweise entstand auch hier 2 R- 78 als Hauptprodukt. 2 S- 78 konnte nur als Nebenprodukt isoliert werden. Über eine reduktive Aminierung konnte man eine Methylgruppe am Ringstickstoff von 2 R- 78 bzw. 2 S- 78 einführen und erhielt 2 R- 81 bzw. 2 S- 81. Mit Moc 2 O konnte man die beiden Diastereomere 2 R- 78 und 2 S- 78 in die geschützten Piperidinderivate 2 R- 82 und 2 S- 82 überführen. Die Moc-geschützte Verbindung 2 R- 82 erhielt man außerdem über eine Synthese des Moc-geschützten Diazoesters 83 und anschließender katalytischen Hydrierung. Nach Abspalten der Boc-Schutzgruppe durch eine Umsetzung der Piperidine 2 R- 81 bzw. 2 S- 81 mit methanolischer Salzsäure konnte man die Dihydrochloride 2 R- 87 bzw. 2 S- 87 isolieren. Die freien Amine 2 R- 88 bzw. 2 S- 88 erhielt man nach Ausschütteln mit gesättigter Natriumcarbonatlösung. Die Piperidylacetate 2 R- 88 und 2 S- 88 konnten mit dem Benzoesäurederivat 79 über eine Amidkopplung verbunden werden. Diese Synthese war sowohl über den von GMEINER benutzten Weg, als auch über die Methode von MOHAPATRA und DATTA erfolgreich. Mit 2 R- 94 und 2 S- 94 konnten die ersten Nemonaprid-Analoga, die ein a-Aminopiperidingrundgerüst enthalten, dargestellt werden (Schema 47 und Schema 48). Das Piperidylacetat 2 R- 88 konnte man mit Lithiumaluminiumhydrid zu dem Piperidylethanol 99 umsetzten. The {{goal of this}} {{studies was}} to apply the tandem-Wittig- 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition to cyclic {{acceptor}} substituted a-hydroxyurethanes. Chiral, non racemic 2 -alkyl- 5 -aminopiperidines should be accessible in high diastereomeric excess by using this reaction. The a-aminopiperidine derivatives should be reacted with 5 -chloro- 2 -methoxy- 4 -methylaminobenzoic acid to the amides and the pharmacological activities of the achieved compounds should be tested. L-pyroglutamic acid {{was used as a}} starting material. The synthesis of the key intermediate 66 starts with a three step reaction sequence to the halogenopyrrolidine derivatives 62 and 63. The introduction of azide functionality by nucleophilic substitution to the azidopyrrolidine derivative 64 followed by the protection of the amide group with Boc 2 O yielded 65. The hydroxyurethane derivative 66 was obtained in two different ways, namely directly by using a DiBAl-H reducing of 65 {{and on the other hand}} by ring opening reaction of 65 with sodium methoxide to 68 followed by a DiBAl-H reduction. For the first time the a-hydroxyurethanes 66 as starting material for the tandem-Wittig- 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition reaction was applied. A product mixture of the a,b-unsaturated azido ester 74, the triazoline 75 and the diazo ester 76 was achieved by using acetic acid as a catalyst. A mixture of the cycloaddition products could be obtained again by treatment of the isolated a,b-unsaturated azido ester 74 with acetic acid. Rearrangement of the triazoline 75 to the corresponding diazo ester 76 was achieved by addition of triethylamine. Only the E-configurated compound 74 was obtained. This leads to the conclusion that the Wittig reaction is under thermodynamic control. The cycloaddition shows excellent diastereoselectivity. By using 1 H-NMR-spectroscopy the trans-configurated cycloaddition product as the single isomer were determined. An explanation for the diastereoselectivity of the 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition is given by a consideration of the steric and electronic properties of two open chain products namely the a,b-unsaturated azido ester 74. An efficient synthetic pathway to the piperidine derivative 2 R- 78 was established by catalytic hydrogenation of the diazo ester 76. The other diastereomer should be obtained by Rh-mediated extrusion of nitrogen and distereoselective hydrogenation of the vinylogous urethane 80. To our surprise the piperidine derivative 2 R- 78 was the main product. 2 S- 78 could only be obtained as the minor stereoisomer. A reductive amination was the most efficient way to introduce a methyl group to the ring nitrogen atom. Introducing Moc 2 O lead to the protected piperidine derivatives 2 R- 82 and 2 S- 82. The protected piperidine derivative 2 R- 78 was also obtained by the synthesis of the Moc-protected diazo ester 83 and following hydrogenation. After cleavage of the Boc-protecting groups with methanolic hydrogen chloride the dihydrochlorides 2 R- 87 and 2 S- 87 were obtained. The free amines 2 R- 88 and 2 S- 88 could be coupled with the benzoic acid derivate 79 by using different coupling methods e. g. the method of MOHAPATRA and DATTA. For the first time with 2 R- 94 and 2 S- 94 Nemonaprid analogous, which include a ƒÒ-aminopiperidine structure, were obtained...|$|R

Mice were sacrificed 16 weeks after treatment. The tumorigenic effect of <b>urethan</b> on the lungs (lung surface pulmonary adenomas) was assessed. In addition, mortality, body weight changes and the anesthetic effect of <b>urethan</b> were determined. The rhythmic pattern of DNA synthesis in the lung and the comparative rhythmic pattern in the liver were assessed using a tritiated thymidine incorporation assay. ^ In the first adenoma bioassay, the lung tumorigenic response in mice given the highest dose of <b>urethan</b> exhibited a 12 -hour rhythm with a major peak in tumor yield at 0100 and a secondary peak at 1300; reduced yields occurred at 0500 - 0900 and 2100.

The acute toxic and pharmacological effects correlated to exhibit a maximal effect during dark hours (activity span).

40|$|Background and Aim: To determin {{the most}} {{sensitive}} tissues to carcinogenic effect of urethane and co-carcinogenic effect of sodium nitrite by investigation of histopathological variations in different tissues of balb/c mice. Materials and Methods: An experimental study in 40 inbred balb/c mice aged 9 - 11 weeks was designed. The samples were classified into 4 groups: The first group was mice treated with 50 mg/l sodium nitrite in 0. 9 % NaCl instead drinking water SN&NaCl). The urethane group (U) was characterized by intraperitoneal injection of 3 times urethane (600 mg/ kg/day at 48 hour intervals). The third group was given 50 mg/l sodum nitrite in drinking water (U&SN) following the same intake of urethane as the second group, and the forth one was the control group. All mice were sacrificed after 20 weeks; tissues were removed and examined for histopathological changes. Data analyzed by Fisher exact test. Results: The formation of lung tumor was, significantly, increased in the urethane group {{as compared with the}} control group & (NS+Nacl) groups (respectively P<. 004 & P<. 02) and in (U+NS) group as compared with the control group & (NS+Nacl) groups (respectively P<. 003 & P<. 02). In females mice also The formation of lung tumor was, significantly, increased in the urethane group as compared with the control group & (NS+NaCl) groups (P<. 05) and in the (U+NS) group was significantly higher than those in (C) & (NS+NaCl) groups (P<. 009). The formation of lung adenocarcinomas was, significantly, increased in the (U+NS) group as compaired with the (C) & (NS+Nacl) groups (P<. 003). In females mice also the formation of lung adenocarcinomas was, significantly, increased in the (U+NS) group as compaired with the (C) & (NS+Nacl) groups (P<. 009) and (U) group (p<. 05).

40|$|Mice {{were exposed}} to {{plutonium}} dioxide (PuO 2) aerosols 2 weeks before or after <b>urethan</b> injection. Both exposures reduced the number and size of adenomas. The incidence of arrested metaphases showed no consistently significant differences between plutonium-exposed and mock-exposed animals. The results are discussed in relation to recent electron microscopic evidence of degenerative changes in the type II epithelial cells of the mouse lung following PuO 2 inhalation. It is concluded that damage at the cellular level {{may account for the}} observed reduction in growth of pulmonary adenomas in mice whose lungs contained plutonium particles...|$|E
40|$|New nanohybrids were {{synthesized}} by grafting organosilanes on silica nanoparticles. These nanohybrids containing dibipyridine, urea, and <b>urethan</b> functionalities {{can be used}} as new synthons for nanotechnology, catalysis, or nanocomposites. The {{influence of}} the organosilane amount was studied together with the pH and solvent effects. The nanohybrids have been thoroughly characterized by diffuse reflectance IR Fourier transform (DRIFT) and NMR spectroscopies, electron microscopy (transmission and scanning), thermogravimetry (thermogravimetric analysis and differential thermal analysis), and nitrogen adsorption. We have demonstrated that grafting can occur in two ways on the silica surface: organosilane oligomer grafting or organosilane monolayer grafting. Through the synthesis of new organosilanes, containing dipyridine functionality combined with methylaminopropylsilane, interesting electronic and complexing properties are now available on the silica surface for further reactivity. This has been obtained for both triethoxysilyl and dimethylethoxysilyl derivatives with the same grafting ratio indicating that dimethylethoxysilane is a good precursor for developing nanohybrid chemistry. In this case, organosilane monolayer grafted nanoparticules were ascertained. Once grafted, the chemical integrity of ureas, <b>urethan,</b> and dipyridine silanes were preserved, as demonstrated by DRIFT and 13 C cross polarization magic angle spinning (CP MAS) NMR spectroscopies, and covalent grafting on silanol sites was confirmed by 29 Si CP MAS NMR experiments. The size and morphology of silica nanoparticles were retained after grafting as long as the organosilane-to-silica ratio did not exceed 2 mmol g− 1, even in water or water/alcohol mixtures. This work demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} limit the grafting to lower oligomers, giving nanohybrids with very interesting chemical surface reactivity...|$|E
40|$|Several {{elements}} of two-stage carcinogenesis {{apply to the}} development of lung tumors in Strain A or Swiss-Webster mice. At least three agents which have been identified as promoters in skin, urinary bladder and liver will also enhance tumor formation in lung: phorbol, saccharin and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). The antioxidant BHT acts in many respects like a typical promoting agent: it is effective if animals are treated after exposure to an initiating agent, but not if they are treated beforehand. Administration of BHT can be delayed up to 5 months after <b>urethan</b> treatment and still enhance tumor formation. BHT enhances lung tumor formation regardless of its route of administration (IP injection, gavage, or ingestion In the diet). The lowest dose of BHT required to produce an effect has not yet been determined. In ' at least one mouse strain, BHT also enhances tumor formation in animals initiated with 3 -methylcholanthrene or dimethylnitrosamine. On the other hand, no evidence is available yet to show that BHT would enhance tumor development in animals treated with subcarcinogenic doses of an initiating compound. Nor has it been possible to produce more tumors with BHT in mouse strains which have a low spontaneous tumor incidence and respond poorly to <b>urethan.</b> The question has not been resolved whether BHT accelerates growth of preformed tumors only or whether it induces the formation of more tumors. Nevertheless, the data collected on the effects of BHT on mouse lung tumor development have broadened the concept of two-stage carcinogenesis and complement the evidence for initiation- promotion available for other epithelial tissues such as liver, colon, stomach, trachea, urinary bladder and mammary gland...|$|E

Regional differences in {{action potential}} duration and conduc-tion may be important. We have recorded monophasic action potentials (MAPS) from the endocardium and epicardium in nine open-chest dogs during graded intravenous infusion of potassium up to a plasma level of 9 mM.

40|$|ABSTRACT-The {{chromosomal}} {{distribution of}} chromosome aber-rations (CA) and sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) induced by various chemical carcinogens such as 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[a) an-thracene, 7, 8, 12 -trimethylbenz[a) anthracene, 1 -butyl- 1 -nitro-sourea, <b>urethan,</b> 4 -nitroquinoline 1 -oxide, 2 -(2 -furyl) - 3 -(5 -nitro- 2 -furyl) acrylamide, and the antineoplastic compound mitomycin C was studied {{with the use}} of noninbred Long-Evans male rat bone marrow cells in vivo and in vitro. The CA and SCE induced by these structurally different chemicals were distributed in a similar pattern among and along chromosomes when the chemicals were given a short time (6 hr) before the metaphase cells were harvested. The specific distribution pattern of chemically induced CA and SCE along chromosomes was attributed to the late DNA replication of the vulnerable chromosome regions. Conversely, X-ray-induced CA were distributed more randomly. 'T'hus th...|$|E
40|$|The {{expression}} of Fos, the protein {{product of the}} primary response gene c-fos, was used metabolically to map the short-term (1 hr) effects of urethane and sodium pentobarbital anesthesia in rat. Subsequently, urethane-anesthetized rats were used to study the integrated response to electrical stimulation (l-l. 5 hr) of the pontine parabrachial nucleus (PBN), an important center for relay of autonomic information in the brain. lmmunohistochemistry was used to localize Foslike immunoreactivity (FLI) in the brain. To approximate amounts of FLI in the conscious animal, rats were killed immediately after attaining surgical anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital(50 mg/kg) or urethane (1. 2 - 1. 7 gm/kg).

40|$|The {{possible}} {{interaction of}} environmental factors with the endogenous mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) genome {{in the development}} of mammary tumors in the low-tumor-incidence BALB/c mouse strain was examined. Tumors were induced in virgin female animals by treatment with chemical carcinogen 7, 12 - dimethylbenz[α]anthracene or <b>urethan,</b> with or without prolonged hormonal stimulation, or by X-irradiation. Concomitant hormonal stimulation resulted in increased tumor incidences compared with those induced by chemical carcinogen treatment alone. The frequency of tumor induction by irradiation alone or in combination with <b>urethan</b> or prolactin stimulation was very low. MMTV expression in the mammary tumors was assayed by nucleic acid hybridization and by immunohistochemical staining. Depending upon the treatment group, 0 to 89 % of the tumors contained detectable levels of MMTV RNA (≥ 0. 0005 % of the total cellular RNA). Tumors which contained detectable viral transcripts exhibited only low levels of MMTV RNA, which did not appear to represent the accumulation of RNA sequences homologous to the entire MMTV genome; synthesis of MMTV structural proteins was detected in only one tumor. Viral RNA-positive tumors were generally associated with a longer latent period. MMTV RNA expression occurred in tumors classified histologically as adenoacanthomas, as well as in mammary adenocarcinomas, although the cell types in the adenoacanthomas expressing viral RNA were not identified. It does not appear that expression of the endogenous MMTV genome is required for maintenance of all mammary tumors in BALB/c mice, although partial genome expression undetectable by the methods employed cannot be ruled out. Linear regression analyses were performed. The mean time to tumor appearance and the percentage of tumors which were MMTV RNA positive were found to vary linearly {{as a function of the}} total dose of 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[α]anthracene administered. The percentage of tumors which were MMTV RNA positive was also shown to be linearly related to the mean time to tumor appearance. These relationships provide a basis for predictions in the BALB/c system related to these parameters...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY-Hemopoietic {{recovery}} {{is described in}} mice irradiated 2 days after an injection of vinblastine or vincristine, stathmokinetic agents whose destructive effects on bone marrow cellularity were most severe at that time. Recovery, which involved granulocyte, lymphocyte, and hemoglobin concentrations in the blood and marrow cellularity, occurred much earlier in the treated than in the untreated mice. The number of animals surviving longer than 28 days increased, though in some instances deaths were more numerous 3. 5 - 4. 5 days after irradiation. A working hypothesis consistent with the observations is proposed. -J Nat Cancer Inst 39 : 1055 - 1066, 1967. EARLY HEMOPOIETIC {{recovery is}} induced and survival increased in irradiated mice when given injections of colchicine or certain of its derivatives 1 - 3 days before irradiation (1 - 3).

40|$|The {{present study}} was an {{examination}} of state-dependent functional connectivity during spontaneous activity between the piriform cortex and its upstream and downstream connections. Rats were anesthetized with <b>urethan</b> and allowed to spontaneously cycle between fast- and slow-wave states similar to fast- and slow-wave sleep states. Local field potential recordings were made from the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, dorsal hippocampus, amygdala, and primary visual cortex. The results demonstrate that during slow-wave sleep-like states, when the piriform cortex shows reduced sensitivity to odor input via the olfactory bulb, there is enhanced coherence with other forebrain structures. Granger causality analyses suggest that the link between piriform cortical and hippocampal activity during slow-wave state is {{in the direction of}} the hippocampus to the piriform cortex rather than the reverse. The results suggest that slow-wave sleep-like states may provide an opportunity for the transfer and/or consolidation of information related to odor memories, specifically at a time when the piriform cortex is less sensitive to sensory input...|$|E

40|$|The author made an {{experiment}} {{in order to determine}} whether the spleen has any connection with the formation of socalled Traube-Hering's blood pressure curve. Since Roy observed the rhythmical contraction of the spleen, many experiments have been made with the purpose of solving the above problem, but they were all made after opening the peritoneal cavity, so that the blood vessels of the abdomen were exposed to the air, therefore the results may have been greatly influenced by the abnormal conditions of this exposure. A dog and a rabbit, from which the spleen had been previously cut out, were anaesthetized with morphine and <b>urethan</b> respectively, and the canula was placed in the carotid artery, and then connected with a mercury manometer. Artificial respiration maintained pulmonary ventiation after an intra-venous injection of curare. The interruption of artificial respiration caused a gradual rise of blood pressure and a typical Traube-Hering's wave in the blood pressure curve.
