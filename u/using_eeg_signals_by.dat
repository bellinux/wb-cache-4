30|$|Most of {{the studies}} for epileptic {{activity}} detection/classification <b>using</b> <b>EEG</b> <b>signal</b> processing, formulate methodologies that analyse the <b>EEG</b> <b>signal</b> <b>by</b> extracting informative features from it [3 – 20]. To this end, spectral analysis of the <b>EEG</b> <b>signal</b> is essential, since epileptic activity interrupts normal brain functionality. Analysing the <b>EEG</b> <b>signal</b> frequency patterns in order to extract spectral characteristics {{is one of the}} most common types of EEG analysis, either by itself (i.e. by focusing on the frequency domain) or combined with other types of analysis (such as non-linear analysis), thus resulting to a vector of features. Then, these features are used as input into a classifier, resulting to classification of epileptic signals.|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, noninvasive BMIs for human users derive the user’s intent from scalp-recorded {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) activity. Because these systems {{do not require}} invasive surgical implants, {{they can be used}} for wide range of applications. Up so far, they have been mainly used for cursor control and communication by means of selection of letters or items on a computer screen [9]-[11]. Recently, an electrical powered wheelchair is controlled by noninvasive BMI [12]. However, despite having the great advantage of not exposing the subject to the risks of brain surgery, EEG-based techniques provide communication channels of limited capacity. In this study, we not only <b>use</b> <b>EEG</b> <b>signals</b> as communication tool but also use them as control signals of external artificial devices. Therefore, one of our main purposes here is to find and extract stable <b>EEG</b> <b>signals</b> <b>by</b> task design and use the signals to control an external robot for power assist.|$|R

30|$|<b>EEG</b> <b>signal</b> is the {{external}} manifestation of brain thinking activity. Since <b>EEG</b> <b>signals</b> have been recorded, people {{use a variety}} of methods to <b>use</b> <b>EEG</b> <b>signals</b> to reveal brain activity [1 – 5]. In these studies, <b>EEG</b> <b>signals</b> induced <b>by</b> image stimuli have been widely used in many studies due to stable features. For example, Mamoru N et al.

The results showed a negative correlation between the <b>EEG</b> <b>signal</b> and pupil size in the 9 – 11  Hz frequency band; Yan X D [7] et al. used image stimulation to study the “image advantage effect.” Through the discussion of the two types of self-demolition, the feature extraction of the image-stimulated <b>EEG</b> <b>signals</b> is <b>used</b> to improve the accuracy of the test case’s brain in test civil and criminal cases. Liu F J et al. [8] <b>used</b> picture-evoked <b>EEG</b> <b>signals</b> to study the different responses of teenagers and older adults to voice, pictures, and Chinese characters.

30|$|The <b>use</b> of <b>EEG</b> <b>signals</b> as an {{identification}} tool {{is an important}} branch of the current identity research.

However, this study does not have a good analysis of the effect of photo properties as a stimulus on the accuracy of classification.
