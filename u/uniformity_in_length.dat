30|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that by using homoepitaxial chemical growth method highly uniform, single crystalline NR arrays arranged in a predefined pattern can be prepared. By changing the growth parameters, diameter and length of the NRs can be tuned {{in the range of}} 90 – 170 nm and 500 nm– 2.3 μm, respectively. The monodispersity of the diameter of single crystalline NRs can be < 2 % by maintaining an excellent uniformity in the longitudinal dimension. We exploited two alternative synthesis routes using soft and hard under-layer to obtain all-ZnO and metal contacted, anchored NR arrays, respectively. The former one can be a promising candidate for nanopillar-based photonic crystals, especially if a refractive index contrast between the NR and the ZnO substrate is realized. On the other hand, anchored NR arrays contacted on the bottom are promising structures for nanopiezotronics. The arrays show excellent <b>uniformity</b> <b>in</b> <b>length</b> and the dense pattern (~ 30 NR/μm 2) can be adjusted to the top vibrating electrode of the nanogenerator. Thereby a significant improvement in the output voltage, hence a more efficient energy harvesting can be predicted.|$|E
30|$|Vertically aligned ZnO {{nanorods}} (NRs) and nanowires (NWs) are attracting {{much interest}} for several {{applications such as}} nanophotonics [1, 2], dye-sensitized solar cells [3, 4], electron field emitters [5, 6], surround-gate field effect transistors [7], and nanopiezotronics [8]. A number of preparation methods by high temperature vapor transport [9] and low temperature chemical synthesis [10, 11] were developed. For comparison, the NR arrays can be classified from several aspects: physical and geometrical properties of the individual building blocks and their <b>uniformity</b> <b>in</b> <b>length,</b> in diameter, and in axis-to-substrate angle. The NRs/NWs can be distributed either randomly or in a well-defined way. The above applications require different kinds of nanostructures concerning their geometrical parameters. For instance, photonic crystals with well-defined defects are of importance in nanophotonics [12, 13]. Another demanding application is the construction of ZnO NW-based DC current generator, where the NWs convert the mechanical energy of a vibrating Pt-coated, zig-zag-shaped electrode to electric energy by exploiting the piezoelectric nature of ZnO [14]. Even for nanosensors, however, the generated power density (~ 80 nW/cm 2) should be significantly increased. As Liu et al. [15] have pointed out the output voltage of the system, being now typically {{in the order of}} ~ 10 mV, can be drastically improved by increasing the number of the active NW-s, i.e., the ones which are in continuously contact with the zigzag top electrode. Therefore, two approaches were proposed: improving the uniformity of the NWs on one hand and patterning the array according to the dimension and shape of the top electrode. Vertical ZnO nanoarrays arranged in a designed pattern were recently produced by a few groups using different techniques [16, 17], however, either the geometrical non-uniformity of the NWs or the low density of the vertical microcrystals (~ 1 NR/μm 2) makes their use in nanogenerator application difficult. Moreover, if the nanostructure is produced by vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) method the metal catalyst droplet {{on the top of the}} NW can hinder the formation of the required Schottky contact at the top electrode/NW interface.|$|E

40|$|Molten metal droplet {{detachment}} and plate fusion characteristics, {{which have}} an important bearing on the weld quality, were influenced by the parameters of pulsed current, viz. peak current (I-P), peak duration (T-P), background current (I-B) and background duration (T-B). The complex interdependence of the above parameters of pulsed current {{makes it difficult to}} select the most suitable combination of parameters for welding (Refs. 1 - 3). To resolve this problem, a first estimate of the pulse parametric zone based on burnoff, droplet detachment and are stability criteria was obtained. It has been Further restricted taking into account the short circuit and burnback characteristics. Within this narrowed zone, the suitable combination of the pulsed current parameters has been recommended {{on the basis of a}} combined criteria, viz. <b>uniformity</b> <b>in</b> are <b>length,</b> <b>uniformity</b> <b>in</b> droplet detachment and weld bead surface quality. This is done to obtain good quality welds. These studies have been carried out for a fixed pulse cycle time and one droplet detachment per pulse conditions. Further studies have been carried out for different types of droplet detachments, namely background detachment, one droplet detachment per peak, two droplets detachment per peak and three droplets detachment per peak by varying pulse cycle time. The suitable type of droplet detachment has been selected on the basis of <b>uniformity</b> <b>in</b> are <b>length,</b> <b>uniformity</b> <b>in</b> droplet detachment and <b>uniformity</b> <b>in</b> weld bead surface undulation. The effect of types of droplet detachment on weld bead geometry has been studied.

Moreover, parapatric taxa that exhibit either partial (north-western Bolivia) or complete (northern Peru) reproductive isolation converge in body size. Relative <b>uniformity</b> <b>in</b> the <b>length</b> of the highly modified flower-piercing bill among populations of D. carbonaria that differ significantly in body size suggests that character displacement or interspecific competition is not responsible for these patterns. These findings support the hypothesis that climate, particularly temperature seasonality, is an important environmental determinant of geographic size variation in homeotherms. In addition they demonstrate that clinal variation correlated with subtle climatic gradients can occur in tropical environments...|$|R
