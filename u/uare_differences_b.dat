40|$|Abstract. Monthly mean surface-air {{temperatures}} at 870 {{sites in}} the contiguous United States were analyzed for interannual nd interdecadal v riability over the time interval 1910 - 87. The tempera-tures were analyzed spatially by empirical-orthogonal-function analysis and temporally by singular-spectrum analysis (SSA). The dominant modes of spatio-temporal variability are trends and non-periodic variations with time scales longer than 15 years, decadal-scale oscillations with periods of roughly 7 and 10 years, and interannual oscillations of 2. 2 and 3. 3 years. Together, these modes contribute about 18 % of the slower-than-annual United States temperature variance. Two leading components roughly capture the m an hemispheric temperature trend and represent a long-term warming, largest in the southwest, accompanied by cooling of the domain's outheastern quadrant. The extremes of the 2. 2 -year interannual oscillation characterize temperature <b>differences</b> <b>b</b> tw en the Northeastern and Southwestern States, whereas the 3. 3 -year cycle is p esent mostly in the West-ern States. The 7 - to 10 -year oscillations are rauch less regular and persistent than the interannual oscillations and characterize temperature <b>differences</b> <b>b</b> tw en the western and interior sectors of the United States.

40|$|Objectives: Investigating between-meal snack {{intake and}} its {{associated}} determinants such as emotions and stress presents challenges because both vary from moment to moment throughout the day. A smartphone application (app), was developed to map momentary between-meal snack intake {{and its associated}} determinants {{in the context of}} daily life. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare energy intake reported with the signal-contingent app and reported with an event-contingent paper and pencil diet diary. Methods: In a counterbalanced, cross-sectional design, adults (N = 46) from the general population reported between-meal snack intake during four consecutive days with the app and four consecutive days with a paper and pencil diet diary. A 10 -day interval was applied between the two reporting periods. Multilevel regression analyses were conducted to compare both instruments on reported momentary and daily energy intake from snacks.   Results: Results showed no significant <b>difference</b> (<b>B</b> = 11. 84, p =. 14) in momentary energy intake from snacks between the two instruments. However, a significant <b>difference</b> (<b>B</b> = – 105. 89, p <. 01) was found on energy intake from total daily snack consumption. Conclusions: As at momentary level both instruments were comparable in assessing energy intake, research purposes will largely determine the sampling procedure of choice. When momentary associations across time are the interest of study, a signal-contingent sampling procedure may be a suitable method. Since the compared instruments differed on two main features (i. e. the sampling procedure and the device used) it is difficult to disentangle which instrument was the most accurate in assessing daily energy intake...|$|R

40|$|This paper reformulates, generalizes and {{investigates the}} {{stability}} of the modified Prony algorithm introduced by Osborne (1975), with special reference to rational and exponential fitting. The algorithm, originally for exponential functions, is generalized to the least squares fitting of any function which satisfies a linear homogeneous difference equation. Using the difference equation formulation, the problem is expressed as a separable regression, and hence as a nonlinear eigenproblem in terms of the coefficients of the difference equation. The eigenproblem involves finding the null space of a matrix of data <b>differences</b> <b>B,</b> and is solved using a variant of inverse iteration. Stability of the algorithm is shown to depend on the fact that B closely approximates the Hessian of the sum of squares. The expectations of B and the Hessian are evaluated. In the case of rational fitting, the relative <b>difference</b> between <b>B</b> and the Hessian is shown to converge to zero almost surely. Some details of the implementation of the algorithm are given.
