5000|$|Meanwhile, {{a second}} machine known as B-2 was being built. This {{was similar to}} the B-1 machine but used pulsed power to allow it to reach higher {{magnetic}} energy and included a second heating system known as magnetic pumping. This machine was also modified to add an <b>ultra-high</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>system.</b> Unfortunately, B-2 demonstrated little heating from the magnetic pumping, which was not entirely unexpected because this mechanism required longer confinement times, and this was not being achieved. As it appeared that little could be learned from this system in its current form, in 1958 it was sent to the Atoms for Peace show in Geneva. However, when the heating system was modified, the coupling increased dramatically, demonstrating temperatures within the heating section as high as [...]|$|E
5000|$|This {{led to the}} {{construction}} of the Model B, which had the problem that the magnets were not well mounted and tended to move around when they were powered to their maximum capacity of 50,000 gauss. A second design also failed for the same reason, but this machine demonstrated several-hundred-kilovolt X-rays that suggested good confinement. The lessons from these two designs led to the B-1, used ohmic heating (see below) to reach plasma temperatures around 100,000 degrees. This machine demonstrated that impurities in the plasma caused large x-ray emissions that rapidly cooled the plasma. In 1956, B-1 was rebuilt with an <b>ultra-high</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>system</b> to reduce the impurities but found that even at smaller quantities, they were still a serious problem. Another effect noticed in the B-1 was that during the heating process, the particles would remain confined for only a few tenths of a millisecond, while once the field was turned off, any remaining particles were confined for as long as 10 milliseconds. This appeared to be due to [...] "cooperative effects" [...] within the plasma.|$|E

30|$|Since the {{operation}} of the solar cell device includes the process of photon absorption, carriers separation, transport, and collection; therefore, many parameters affect the performance improvement of the device. However, if only taking into account of the material quality, we need to increase the diffusion length of minority carriers and decrease the recombination, such as surface recombination, radiative recombination, defect-state-related recombination, etc. In order to optimize the above factors, the most important factor is to lower the intrinsic (background) carrier density and to increase the mobility. Though the high-temperature growth by MOCVD is believed to be good to the optic-electric solar cell device due to the decrease of the defect densities and deep centers, however, the <b>ultra-high</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>system</b> of MBE is good at the decreasing the background carrier density.
