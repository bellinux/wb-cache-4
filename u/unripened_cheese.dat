Predictive microbiology models were used to simulate the growth of L. monocytogenes during the cheese process in relation with temperature, pH, and water activity. The model showed significant growth of L. monocytogenes during chilling and storage of the milk collected the day before the cheese production (median increase of 2. 2 log CFU/ml) and during the addition of starter and rennet to milk (median increase of 1. 2 log CFU/ml).

Diacetyl and acetoin production was 0. 01 and 2. 4 mM, respectively, at 0 % oxygen. Maximum acetoin concentration reached 5. 4 mM at 100 % oxygen. Diacetyl production was increased by factors of 2, 6, and 18 at initial oxygen concentrations of 21, 50, and 100 %, respectively. The diacetyl/acetoin concentration ratio increased linearly with initial oxygen concentration: it was eight times higher at 100 % (3. 3 %) than at 0 % oxygen (0. 4 %). The effect of oxygen on diacetyl and acetoin production was also shown with other lactococci.

Cheeses differed in the intensity of the crumbliness attribute, and in preference and intensity of colour attribute. The colour of starter soft cheese, which was tested using a colorimeter, was closer to the colour of probiotic soft cheese than those cheeses which were manufactured without starter culture. The microbial status, storage conditions, rancidity, and the sensory characteristics of <b>unripened</b> soft <b>cheese,</b> which was manufactured with starter culture strains only, were determined during the storage for 50 days at 2 - 5 °C, as well as during their shelf life for the product. Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) contributed to slowing the growth of unwanted microbes, and decreased the values of TBA, TVB-N and TMA in soft cheese. Consequently, delaying the undesirable changes and maintaining the quality of the product and extending its shelf life, when compared with vacuum, brine, and air packaging methods, under the same storage conditions. Potential effects of inulin on the cheese quality and sensory characteristics of probiotic soft cheese were investigated. The cheeses differed in their loads of lactic acid bacteria, in addition to the total solids and water activity. The levels of probiotic bacterial strains were higher in probiotic soft cheese that manufactured with inulin than in cheese without inulin, with a potential in the formation synbiotic between the probiotic strains LA- 5 and BB 12 and inulin. Both cheeses were recorded to have high acceptance in the cheese attributes, in terms of appearance, aroma, colour texture and the overall acceptance. The presence of inulin increased the hardness of cheese under vacuum packaging, after storage for 14 days at 2 - 5 °C. Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research of Ira...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} some of {{the developments}} and problems {{in the field of}} quantitative microbial risk assessment, especially exposure assessment and probabilistic risk assessment models. To illustrate {{some of the}} topics, an initial risk assessment was presented, in which predictive microbiology and survey data were combined with probabilistic modelling to simulate the level of Staphylococcus aureus in <b>unripened</b> <b>cheese</b> made from raw milk at the time of consumption. Due to limited data and absence of dose–response models, a complete risk assessment was not possible. Instead, the final level of bacteria was used as a proxy for the potential enterotoxin level, and thus the potential for causing illness. The assessment endpoint selected for evaluation was the probability that a cheese contained at least 6 log cfu S. aureus g 1 at the time of consumption; the probability of an unsatisfactory cheese, Puc. The initial level of S. aureus, followed by storage temperature had the largest influence on Puc at the two pH-values investigated. Puc decreased with decreasing pH and was up to a factor of 30 lower in low pH cheeses due to a slower growth rate. Of the model assumptions examined, i. e. the proportion of enterotoxigenic strains, the level of S. aureus in non-detect cheeses, the temperature limit for toxin production, and the magnitude and variability of the threshold for an unsatisfactory cheese, it was the latter that had the greatest impact on Puc. The uncertainty introduced by this assumption was in most cases less than a factor of 36, the same order of magnitude as the maximum variability due to pH. Several data gaps were identified and suggestions were made to improve the initial risk assessment, which is valid only to th...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo do presente estudo foi acompanhar a produção de queijo frescal de leite de cabra, avaliando a qualidade higiênica do processamento pela quantificação de coliformes, S. aureus e mesófilos totais. A produção de três diferentes lotes de queijo foi acompanhada, sendo coletadas amostras de várias etapas do processamento. Além disso, amostras de queijo pertencente ao lote acompanhado foram coletadas na prateleira de um estabelecimento {{comercial}} durante seu período de validade. Os suabes coletados foram semeados em ágar sangue ovino; as amostras de água foram submetidas à Colimetria; as demais amostras foram submetidas à contagem de S. aureus, coliformes e mesófilos totais por meio de protocolos de rotina. Verificou-se que, apesar da pasteurização ter diminuído consideravelmente as populações microbianas presentes no leite cru, a falta de sanificação adequada de um equipamento que entrava em contato com o leite cru e que dá acesso ao tanque de coagulação, resultou na recontaminação da matéria-prima. Ao final do processamento, o queijo encontrava-se dentro dos padrões exigidos pela legislação, contudo a elevada contagem de mesófilos totais sugere que sejam melhoradas as medidas de sanitização durante o processamento, a fim de garantir a qualidade higiênica e uma maior vida de prateleira ao queijo produzido. The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the hygienic conditions throughout the manufacture process of a goat <b>unripened</b> <b>cheese,</b> using the enumeration of coliforms, S. aureus and aerobic mesofilic bacteria as indicators. The production of three different lots of cheese was followed, being collected samples throughout the processing steps. Furthermore, samples of cheese belonging to the same sampled lot were collected in the shelf of a commercial establishment throughout the shelf life period. Swabs were streaked onto blood agar plates; water samples were submitted to colimetric assays; all other samples were submitted to coliform, S. aureus and aerobic mesofilic bacteria enumeration using routine protocols. It was observed a great decreasing of bacterial counts in the raw milk during the pasteurization process. In spite of that, the transfer of the pasteurized milk to the coagulation tank by an equipment, which was previously in contact with the raw milk and was inadequately disinfected, resulted in the recontamination of the pasteurized milk. The packed cheese had bacterial counts according to the standards imposed by the Brazilian food regulatory agency. However, the high aerobic mesofilic bacteria counts suggest that the good manufactures practices have to be improved in order to guarantee the hygienic quality and an extender shelf life for the cheese...|$|E

40|$|Halloumi {{cheese is}} made in some Middle Eastern {{countries}} from sheep's and goat's milk. It is a hard, <b>unripened</b> white <b>cheese</b> that tastes like immature Cheddar, {{and it has the}} capacity to melt and stretch when heated. The present investigation was undertaken to provide information on the manufacture of Halloumi cheese from fresh cow's milk, to define a process for its manufacture from recombined milk, and to examine the application of ultrafiltration procedures to Halloumi manufacture. The first part of the research programme was conducted {{in order to determine the}} optimal manufacturing conditions for making Halloumi from fresh cow's milk, and to establish appropriate methods of measuring physical properties of the cheese (stretchability, meltability and fat loss). It was found that those manufacturing variables which altered the rate and extent of acid development (percentage of starter, priming, cooking temperature and time) had a marked effect on cheese physical properties. These variables could be altered by the cheesemaker to optimize Halloumi properties. previous reports indicated that Halloumi with desired properties could not be made from recombined milk. The second part of this thesis describes a study of the manufacture of Halloumi from recombined milk (milk made by recombining skim milk powder with anhydrous milkfat). Two main reasons for this were considered, namely, the effect of homogenization treatment used in the recombining process, and the quality of the powder used. It was demonstrated that high homogenization pressures resulted in poor stretchability and meltability of the cheese. In contrast low pressure homogenization gave cheese with satisfactory properties. A model based on the viscoelastic behaviour of polymer systems was described in an attempt to explain how the homogenization treatments influence the stretching behaviour of the cheese network, and it was possible to verify the model in suitable experiments. The preheat temperatures of the skim milk used in the manufacture of skim milk powders were also shown to markedly affect the properties of the cheese. High preheat temperature resulted in reduced stretchability and meltability of the cheese. It was likely that this was due to alteration of the mineral balance and to denaturation of whey proteins. The concentration of total solids prior to spray drying was shown to have no significant effect on the properties of the cheese. In the final part of the investigation, the application of UF to the manufacture of Halloumi cheese was studied using fresh UF milk, and skim milk powder prepared from UF skim milk. When a 5 : 1 UF concentrate of fresh milk was used, some modification in the setting time and cutting device was necessary. The quality of UF Halloumi was very similar to that of the control cheese. In considering the manufacture of Halloumi from recombined milk using UF skim milk powder, the effects on the cheese quality of variations in the ratio of protein to fat, in the solids concentration of the recombined milk, and in the calcium content of the UF skim milk powder were investigated. Best results were obtained when the cheese was manufactured from recombined milk with a low protein-to-fat ratio. The use of low-calcium UF skim milk powder, as opposed to high-calcium powder, resulted in some improvement in the quality of the cheese. Varying the concentration of the recombined milk solids had no significant effect on the cheese properties. The present investigation has demonstrated that good quality Halloumi cheese having the desirable typical stretchability and meltability can be made not only from fresh cow's milk, but also from recombined and UF milks provided that appropriate materials and manufacturing procedures are used...|$|R
