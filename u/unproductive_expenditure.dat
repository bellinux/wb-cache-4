40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{an investigation of}} the effects of different means of financing government spending on economic growth, inflation, and welfare. In this setting, two different types of government spending are considered: productive expenditures which provide services to the private sector in its production activities; and <b>unproductive</b> <b>expenditures</b> which have no direct influence on the private economy. In turn, two different forms of finance are considered: proportional income taxation; and money creation. The primary result of the paper is, perhaps, striking in its simplicity. Specifically, we find that optimal public finance requires productive government to be financed by money creation and <b>unproductive</b> government <b>expenditure</b> by income taxation. Within the model structure–a representative agent, endogenous growth model with money introduced via a cash-in-advance constraint–the basic result is robust to changes in value of all underlying model parameters such as the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption, the rate of time preference, and the output elasticity of public services. The paper proceeds as follows. Section II contains {{a brief description of the}} model. Section III presents the economic equilibrium, while Sections IV and V compare the effects of financing productive and <b>unproductive</b> <b>expenditures,</b> respectively, by taxation and money creation. Section VI brings together the previous sections considers the joint financing of government expenditures by taxation and money creation.

But this is simply confounding money with wealth. The wealth which has been destroyed was not the money, but the wines, equipages, and furniture which the money purchased; and, these having been destroyed without return, society collectively is poorer by the amount. In proportion as any class is improvident or luxurious, the industry of the country takes the direction of producing luxuries for their use; while not only the employment for productive laborers is diminished, but the subsistence and instruments which are the means of such employment do actually exist in smaller quantity.|$|E

Who is to buy the goods which it will produce? There are no longer customers even for those which were produced before. The goods, therefore (it is said), will remain unsold; they will perish in the warehouses, until capital is brought down {{to what it was}} originally, or rather to as much less as the demand of the customers has lessened. But this is seeing only one half of the matter. In the case supposed, there would no longer be any demand for luxuries on the part of capitalists and land-owners. But, when these classes turn their income into capital, they do not thereby annihilate their power of consumption; they do but transfer it from themselves to the laborers to whom they give employment. Now, there are two possible suppositions in regard to the laborers: either there is, or there is not, an increase of their numbers proportional to the increase of capital. (1.) If there is, the case offers no difficulty. The production of necessaries for the new population takes the place of the production of luxuries for a portion of the old, and supplies exactly the amount of employment which has been lost. (2.) But suppose that there is no increase of population. The whole of what was previously expended in luxuries, by capitalists and landlords, is distributed among the existing laborers, in the form of additional wages. We will assume them to be already sufficiently supplied with necessaries.|$|E

A lower labor supply elasticity (1 /γ) induces a marginal decrease in the welfare gain, with no significant effect on inequality. As for government unproductive spending (ϑ), we simulate several consolidation strategies based on <b>unproductive</b> <b>expenditures</b> with different values for the ϑ parameter. Naturally, the welfare gain increases (decreases) as ϑ becomes lower (higher), although marginally with no effects on inequality. 11 Finally, as the productivity of public investment (η) increases relative {{to the importance of}} public consumption in household’s utility, the substitution of unproductive for productive spending during a consolidation process delivers higher net welfare gains.|$|R

60|$|This {{leads to}} the vexed {{question}} to which Dr. Chalmers has very particularly adverted: whether the funds required by a government for extraordinary <b>unproductive</b> <b>expenditure</b> are best raised by loans, the interest only being provided by taxes, or whether taxes should be at once laid on to the whole amount; which is called, in the financial vocabulary, raising {{the whole of the}} supplies within the year. Dr. Chalmers is strongly for the latter method. He says the common notion is that, in calling for the whole amount in one year, you require what is either impossible, or very inconvenient; that the people can not, without great hardship, pay the whole at once out of their yearly income; and that it is much better to require of them a small payment every year in the shape of interest, than so great a sacrifice once for all. To which his answer is, that the sacrifice is made equally in either case. Whatever is spent can not but be drawn from yearly income. The whole and every part of the wealth produced in the country forms, or helps to form, the yearly income of somebody. The privation which it is supposed must result from taking the amount in the shape of taxes is not avoided by taking it in a loan. The suffering is not averted, but only thrown upon the laboring-classes, the least able, and who least ought, to bear it: while all the inconveniences, physical, moral, and political, produced by maintaining taxes for the perpetual payment of the interest, are incurred in pure loss. Whenever capital is withdrawn from production, or from the fund destined for production, to be lent to the state and expended unproductively, that whole sum is withheld from the laboring-classes: the loan, therefore, is in truth paid off the same year; the whole of the sacrifice necessary for paying it off is actually made: only it is paid to the wrong persons, and therefore does not extinguish the claim; and paid by the very worst of taxes, a tax exclusively on the laboring-class. And, after having, in this most painful and unjust of ways, gone through the whole effort necessary for extinguishing the debt, the country remains charged with it, and with the payment of its interest in perpetuity.|$|E

Suppose, however, that C, the {{borrowing}} landlord, is a spendthrift, who burdens {{his land}} not {{to increase his}} fortune but to squander it, expending the amount in equipages and entertainments. In {{a year or two}} it is dissipated, and without return. A is as rich as before; he has no longer his ten thousand pounds, but he has a lien on the land, which he could still sell for that amount. C, however, is ten thousand pounds poorer than formerly; and nobody is richer. It may be said that those are richer who have made profit out of the money while it was being spent. No doubt if C lost it by gaming, or was cheated of it by his servants, that is a mere transfer, not a destruction, and those who have gained the amount may employ it productively. But if C has received the fair value for his expenditure in articles of subsistence or luxury, which he has consumed on himself, or by means of his servants or guests, these articles have ceased to exist, and nothing has been produced to replace them: while if the same sum had been employed in farming or manufacturing, the consumption which would have taken place would have been more than balanced {{at the end of the}} year by new products, created by the labor of those who would in that case have been the consumers. By C’s prodigality, that which would have been consumed with a return is consumed without return. C’s tradesmen may have made a profit during the process; but, if the capital had been expended productively, an equivalent profit would have been made by builders, fencers, tool-makers, and the tradespeople who supply the consumption of the laboring-classes; while, at the expiration of the time (to say nothing of an increase), C would have had the ten thousand pounds or its value replaced to him, which now he has not. There is, therefore, on the general result, a difference, to the disadvantage of the community, of at least ten thousand pounds, being the amount of C’s <b>unproductive</b> <b>expenditure.</b> To A, the difference is not material, since his income is secured to him, and while the security is good, and the market rate of interest the same, he can always sell the mortgage at its original value. To A, therefore, the lien of ten thousand pounds on C’s estate is virtually a capital of that amount; but is it so in reference to the community? It is not. A had a capital of ten thousand pounds, but this has been extinguished—dissipated and destroyed by C’s prodigality. A now receives his income, not from the produce of his capital, but from some other source of income belonging to C, probably from the rent of his land, that is, from payments made to him by farmers out of the produce of their capital.|$|E

Second, I find that, within the software industry, the quality of earnings for expensers is greater than for capitalizers. Finally, I find that, among the capitalizers, those with a large increase in software capital have lower earnings quality than others.

Endogenous growth theory integrated (among several other factors) fiscal policy to the growth models, enabling it to influence long run growth performance. According to these theories some elements of the government budget have positive effects on the long run growth rate of the economy (productive expenditures, and budget balance), while others are neutral (non-distortionary taxation and <b>unproductive</b> <b>expenditures),</b> or have negative consequences for growth (distortionary taxation).

5000|$|One {{of the key}} {{contributions}} of Monopoly Capital is its application {{of the concept of}} economic surplus. The economic surplus is most simply the difference between “what a society produces and the costs of producing it. The size of the surplus is an index of productivity and wealth, of how much freedom a society has to accomplish whatever goals it may set for itself. The composition of the surplus shows how it uses that freedom: how much it invests in expanding its productive capacity, how much it consumes in various forms, how much it wastes and in what ways.” [...] Although some scholars viewed the introduction of this concept as a break with the Marxist approach to value, later publications by Baran and Sweezy, as well as other authors, have continued to establish the importance of this innovation, its consistency with Marx's labor concept of value, and supplementary relation to Marx's category of surplus value.Baran and Sweezy argue that under the oligopolistic conditions of modern economies—dominated by big business—the surplus tends to rise. The vast extent of this increasing actual and potential surplus is visible in the underutilization of productive capacity, the level of unemployment, the waste embodied in the sales effort, and military spending. This is because monopoly/oligopoly conditions result in both insufficient opportunities for profitable reinvestment of the surplus (which shows up as excess capacity and unemployment) and forms of non-price competition involve large amounts of unproductive labor (e.g. in the sales effort and product differentiation). The overall result is a tendency toward economic stagnation and increased <b>unproductive</b> <b>expenditures</b> as a response.|$|R
