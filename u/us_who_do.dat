60|$|As {{to those}} of <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not look on a play as a mere {{question}} of pantomime and clowning psychological interest is everything, I determined, consequently, {{to make a change}} in the precise moment of revelation. This determination, however, was entered into long before I had the opportunity of studying the culture, courtesy, and critical faculty displayed in such papers as the Referee, Reynolds', and the Sunday Sun.|$|E
60|$|Of all the companions {{of light}} which {{endeavor}} to induce it to forsake its former simple habits, {{there is not}} one which has the influence possessed by glass. When light and glass get together it is difficult to divine what tricks they are going to perform.

"It is my firm belief," [...] said Mrs. Belmont gravely, [...] "that {{there was}} not one of <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not rise to a greater height during those days in the desert than ever before or since.

60|$|I wanted more. I {{looked from}} {{face to face}} {{surrounding}} me, and in most of them I found reflected undoubtedly my own sensations. If it {{be a good thing}} to excite this blood thirst in the modern man, then the Mensur is a useful institution. But is it a good thing? We prate about our civilisation and humanity, but those of <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not carry hypocrisy to the length of self-deception know that underneath our starched shirts there lurks the savage, with all his savage instincts untouched. Occasionally he may be wanted, but we never need fear his dying out. On the other hand, it seems unwise to over-nourish him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pride," [...] {{observed}} Mary, who piqued herself {{upon the}} solidity of her reflections, [...] "is {{a very common}} failing, I believe. By all that I have ever read, I am convinced {{that it is very}} common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am an individualist," [...] she {{admitted}} simply. [...] "But I am at least logical in that philosophy, and the individualists who attend the churches to-day are not. The inconsistency {{of their lives}} is what makes those of <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not go to church doubt the efficacy of their creed, {{which seems to have}} no power to change them. The majority of people in St. John's are no more Christians than I am. They attend service once a week, {{and the rest of the}} time they are bent upon getting all they can of pleasure and profit for themselves. Do you wonder that those who consider this spectacle come inevitably to the conclusion that either Christianity is at fault, is outworn, or else that it is presented in the wrong way?" ...|$|E

60|$|It was no {{time for}} the follies of sentiment. There was not one of <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not know secret {{satisfaction}} at the occurrence of each death. Luckiest of all was Israel Stickney in casting lots, so that in the end, when he passed, he was a veritable treasure trove of clothing. It gave a new lease of life to the survivors.|$|R
60|$|Then it was, {{when the}} few of <b>us</b> <b>who</b> yet lived, feared each moment lest the savages would {{put an end}} to us, that we saw sailing up into the bay two small ships, and I doubt if there was any among <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not fall upon his knees and give thanks aloud to God for the help which had come at the very moment when it had seemed that we were past all aid.|$|R
60|$|That Belgium {{is now one}} of the European kingdoms, {{living by}} its own laws, resting on its own bottom, with a king and court, palaces and {{parliament}} of its own, is known to all the world. And a very nice little kingdom it is; full of old towns, fine Flemish pictures, and interesting Gothic churches. But in the memory of very many of <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not think ourselves old men, Belgium, as it is now called--in those days it used to be Flanders and Brabant--was a part of Holland; and it obtained its own independence by a revolution. In that revolution the most important military step was the siege of Antwerp, which was defended on the part of the Dutch by General Chasse, with the utmost gallantry, but nevertheless ineffectually.|$|E
60|$|As {{a student}} De Maistre was indefatigable. He never belonged to that languid band who hoped to learn {{difficult}} things by easy methods. The only way, he warned his son, is to shut your door, {{to say that}} you are not within, and to work. 'Since they have set themselves to teach us how we ought to learn the dead languages, you can find nobody who knows them; and it is amusing enough that people who don't know them, should be so obstinately bent on demonstrating the vices of the methods employed by <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> know them.' He was one of those wise and laborious students who do not read without a pen in their hands. He never shrank from the useful toil of transcribing abundantly from all the books he read everything that could by any possibility eventually be of service to him in his inquiries. His notebooks were enormous. As soon as one of them was filled, he carefully made up an index of its contents, numbered it, and placed it on a shelf with its unforgotten predecessors. In one place he accidentally mentions that he had some thirty of these folios over the head of his writing-table.|$|E
60|$|That {{reason was}} {{furnished}} {{me by the}} complacent and unfrightened prophets four years ago, {{and it has been}} furnished me again to-day. If conversions to new religions or to old ones were in any considerable degree achieved through the intellect, the aforesaid reason would be sound and sufficient, no doubt; the inquirer into Christian Science might go away unconvinced and unconverted. But we all know that conversions are seldom made in that way; that {{such a thing as a}} serious and painstaking and fairly competent inquiry into the claims of a religion or of a political dogma is a rare occurrence; and that the vast mass of men and women are far from being capable of making such an examination. They are not capable, for the reason that their minds, howsoever good they may be, are not trained for such examinations. The mind not trained for that work is no more competent to do it than are lawyers and farmers competent to make successful clothes without learning the tailor's trade. There are seventy-five million men and women among <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not know how to cut out and make a dress-suit, and they would not think of trying; yet they all think they can competently think out a political or religious scheme without any apprenticeship to the business, and many of them believe they have actually worked that miracle. But, indeed, the truth is, almost all the men and women of our nation or of any other get their religion and their politics where they get their astronomy--entirely at second hand. Being untrained, they are no more able to intelligently examine a dogma or a policy than they are to calculate an eclipse.|$|E

50|$|It {{was decided}} that Vietnam would be divided at the 17th {{parallel}} until 1956, when democratic elections would be held under international supervision. All parties involved agreed to this (Ho Chi Minh had strong support in the north, which was more populous than the south, and was thus comfortable that he would win an election), except for the <b>US,</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> {{not want to see}} Communism spreading in a domino effect throughout Asia.|$|R
6000|$|Perhaps {{no country}} that ever yet existed {{has been so}} little understood, or so much misrepresented, as this America of ours. It is as little understood, I was {{on the point of}} saying, at home as it is abroad, and almost as much misrepresented. Certainly its possessors are a good deal {{addicted}} to valuing themselves on distinctive advantages that, in reality, they do not enjoy, while their enemies declaim about vices and evils from which they are comparatively free. Facts are made to suit theories, and thus it is that we see well-intentioned, and otherwise respectable writers, constantly running into extravagances, in order to adapt the circumstances to the supposed logical or moral inference. This reasoning backwards, has caused Alison, with all his knowledge and fair-mindedness, to fall into several egregious errors, as I have discovered while recently reading his great work on Europe. He says we are a migratory race, and that we do not love the sticks and stones that surround us, but quit the paternal roof without regret, and consider the play-grounds of infancy as only so much land for the market. He also hazards the assertion, that there is not {{such a thing as a}} literal farmer,--that is a tenant, who farms his land from a landlord--in all America. Now, as a rule, and comparing the habits of America with those of older countries, in which land is not so abundant, this may be true; but as literal fact, nothing can be less so. Four-fifths of the inhabited portion of the American territory, has a civilized existence of half a century's duration; and there has not been time to create the long-lived attachments named, more especially in the regions that are undergoing the moral fusion that is always an attendant of a new settlement. That thousands of heartless speculators exist among <b>us,</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> regard everything, even to the graves of their fathers, as only so much improvable property, is as undeniable as the fact that they are odious to all men of any moral feeling; but thousands and tens of thousands are to be found in the country, who do reverence their family possessions from a sentiment that is creditable to human nature. I will not mention Clawbonny, and its history, lest I might be suspected of being partial; but it would be easy for me to point out a hundred families, embracing all classes, from the great proprietor to the plain yeoman, who own and reside on the estates of those who first received them from the hand of nature, and this after one or two centuries of possession. What will Mr. Alison say, for instance, of the Manor of Rensselear? A manor, in the legal sense it is no longer, certainly, the new institutions destroying all the feudal tenures; but, as mere property, the late Patroon transmitted it as regularly to his posterity, as any estate was ever transmitted in Europe. This extensive manor lies in the heart of New York, a state about as large and about as populous as Scotland, and it embraces no less than three cities in its bosom, though their sites are not included in its ownership, having been exempted by earlier grants. It is of more than two centuries' existence, and it extends eight-and-forty miles east and west, and half that distance, north and south. Nearly all this vast property is held, at this hour, of the Van Rensselears, as landlords, and is farmed by their tenants, there being several thousands of the latter. The same is true, on a smaller scale, of the Livingston, the Van Cortlandt, the Philipse, the Nicoll, and various other old New York estates, though several were lost by attainder in the revolution. I explain these things, lest any European who may happen to read this book, should regard it as fiction; for, allowing for trifling differences, a hundred Clawbonnys are to be found on the two banks of the Hudson, at this very hour.[*] ...|$|E
