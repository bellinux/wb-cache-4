50|$|In {{a segment}} of DCC-powered track, it is {{possible}} to power a single analog model locomotive by itself (or in addition to the DCC equipped engines), depending on the choice of commercially available base systems.

40|$|It is {{a general}} {{assumption}} that pneumatic muscle-type actuators will {{play an important role}} in the development of an assistive rehabilitation robotics system. In the last decade, the development of a pneumatic muscle actuated lower-limb leg orthosis has been rather slow compared to other types of actuated leg orthoses that use <b>AC</b> <b>motors,</b> <b>DC</b> <b>motors,</b> pneumatic cylinders, linear actuators, series elastic actuators (SEA) and brushless servomotors.

This paper presents a survey of existing lower-limb leg orthoses for rehabilitation, which implement pneumatic muscle-type actuators, such as McKibben artificial muscles, rubbertuators, air muscles, pneumatic artificial muscles (PAM) or pneumatic muscle actuators (PMA).

25|$|A {{servomotor}} is a motor, {{very often}} {{sold as a}} complete module, which is used within a position-control or speed-control feedback control system mainly control valves, such as motor-operated control valves. Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended {{for use in a}} servomechanism must have well-documented characteristics for speed, torque, and power. The speed vs. torque curve is quite important and is high ratio for a servo motor. Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are also important; these factors limit the overall performance of the servomechanism loop. Large, powerful, but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional <b>AC</b> or <b>DC</b> <b>motors</b> and drive systems with position or speed feedback on the motor. As dynamic response requirements increase, more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used. AC motors' superior power density and acceleration characteristics compared to that of <b>DC</b> <b>motors</b> tends to favor PM synchronous, BLDC, induction, and SRM drive applications.|$|R

40|$|Rolling mill drive-trains, {{driven by}} <b>AC</b> or <b>DC</b> <b>motors,</b> have {{historically}} experienced premature component fatigue failures {{even when the}} perceived operating load is well below the design limit. This is often related to low damped torsional vibrations, especially to self-excited vibrations in rolling slippage (especially during threading and tailing out of a rolled piece), overloading {{the elements of the}} drive-train. Long transmission shafts make these vibrations become more critical. A regulator aimed at damping the torsional vibrations of the rolling mill drive-train and thus reducing the electric motor speed fluctuations is presented in this paper. The proposed regulator relies on a reduced order state observer able to estimate the shaft torque amplifications due to the working process. The capability of the regulator to damp out torsional vibrations has been verified through simulations on a lumped parameter torsional model of a single-stand rolling mill accounting for torsional deformability of the power-train shafts...|$|R
50|$|Electric engines {{typically}} use batteries {{to store}} electricity {{which is used}} to power electric motor. The electric motor runs on an array of batteries. The battery delivers the power to the motor, which is either <b>AC</b> or <b>DC.</b> The difference between <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> <b>motors</b> is the sort of system that is required to run it in an electric vehicle. An AC motor is generally cheaper but the components required to run it in an electric vehicle such as the controller and inverter makes it more expensive than the <b>DC</b> <b>motor.</b> A unique feature of electric vehicles compared to its gasoline counterparts, the electric vehicle is more simple than the gasoline vehicle. The electric vehicle bypasses the gasoline car components such as the crankshaft which allows it to generate power much faster than gasoline. Because of the faster transfer of power, the electric vehicle is able to accelerate faster than gasoline cars.In the 1970s, the electric vehicle made its reappearance because of the 1973 OPEC Oil Embargo. Previously, the abundant gasoline had become the prime source of fuel for vehicles. But after the shortage, manufacturers began looking towards electric vehicles again. Despite the improved technology from the 1800s, the electric vehicles faced similar technological flaws such as limited mileage and speed. They could only travel up to 45 miles per hour and had a range of approximately 40 miles.|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{development}} and implementation of new technologies in the fields of electronics, electro motion and control systems engineering, had a great impact on all kinds of industries. Industrial electronics completely changed its face and modem systems for motion control were introduced. Sophisticated microprocessors for servo control combined with faster power electronic devices, allowed a new generation of electrical motors with permanent rare earth magnets to become the "heart" of contemporary industrial and automotive applications. Most of those motors fall in the category of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSM) or Brushless <b>DC</b> <b>Motors</b> (BDCM) because of their distinctive type of control - sinusoidal or trapezoidal. Despite their numerous advantages over other <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> <b>motors,</b> they have a relatively high price. Thus diagnostics and service, especially of PMSM motors and their feedback control devices, play an important role for keeping machines in industrial plants in a good healthy condition. This paper proposes a platform for comprehensive diagnostics of servo motors and drives, feedback control devices and Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) power modules with a potential to benefit graduate students, industrial service technicians and engineers. ...|$|R
