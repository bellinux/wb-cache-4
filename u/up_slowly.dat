5|$|Edziza's shield volcanoes {{are built}} {{almost entirely of}} fluid lava flows. They formed {{as a result of}} lava flowing out in all {{directions}} from central summit vents and from groups of vents, building a broad, gently sloping cone of flat, domical shape. They are built <b>up</b> <b>slowly</b> by the accretion of thousands of lava flows of highly fluid basaltic lava, which spread widely over great distances, and then cool as thin, gently dipping sheets. In some shield volcano eruptions, basaltic lava has poured out quietly from fissure vents instead of central vents, flooding the surrounding countryside with lava flow upon lava flow, forming Edziza's broad lava plateau.|$|E
5|$|The article {{explains}} {{the sequence of}} events of this August 4 New York City demonstration flight of 1895. When the reporter was all positioned and ready in the sky-cycle he gave word to the ground crew {{to let go of the}} ropes that held the hydrogen balloon back and it immediately lifted the sky-cycle into the air. The airship drifted <b>up</b> <b>slowly</b> at first, going towards the factory roof peaks. The driver-reporter immediately dropped one of the sandbag weights and the sky-cycle airship rose up sharply, avoiding the building roofs. When the airship was about a thousand feet high the attached balloon propeller revolved and the sky-cycle airship flew over the East River. The steamships and tugs that spotted the sky-cycle floating above tooted their whistles.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of hostilities in August 1945, the regiment remained on Tarakan as the demobilisation process, which had begun in early July, was ramped <b>up.</b> <b>Slowly</b> the regiment's size declined and by 30 November 28 officers and 324 other ranks had been repatriated to Australia. The following month the regiment turned in its guns and the last of its personnel left Tarakan on board Stanford Victory. The regiment was finally disbanded on 30 January 1946.|$|E
25|$|When Norman Foster, in {{collaboration}} with the Danish landscape architect Stig L. Andersson, designed the new Elephant House for the adjacent Copenhagen Zoo, it was done as an extension of Frederiksberg Gardens. A three-metre high wall that once separated the two {{has been replaced by a}} simple fence, so that visitors to the public park can now watch the elephants, while affording the elephants distant views as well. The enclosure steps <b>up</b> <b>slowly</b> away from the park, rising to the height of the domes. From a distance, these appear to be buried in the ground, surrounded by ferns and trees.|$|E

In an All-Union Tournament of First Category players at Gorky 1945, Furman posted his first {{noteworthy}} result when he tied for first with Konstantin Klaman, at 11/15. At Tula 1945, Furman placed second with 10½/14, behind only V. Lyublinsky. In the Leningrad Championship of 1946, Furman tied for 8th-9th places, with 8½/17. In the USSR Championship semi-final (URS-ch15 sf), Leningrad 1946, Furman was unsuccessful in advancing, but made a highly respectable score of 9/18, to tie for 9th-10th places. He was moving <b>up</b> <b>slowly</b> through the incredibly deep Soviet vanguard.|$|E
25|$|Early 1917 saw the 46th Division {{still holding}} {{the line in the}} Gommecourt area. However, at the {{beginning}} of March, patrols found that the Germans were beginning to retreat from the Gommecourt defences. The division followed <b>up</b> <b>slowly</b> and cautiously, but on the night of 14 March an attack on Bucquoy Graben (trench) by the 1/5th North Staffs and 1/6th South Staffs led to heavy casualties. The rushed attack had been ordered by V Corps headquarters despite the protests of the divisional commander. The battalions had been on the training grounds practising for the attack when it was brought forward. Although 'the assault was gallantly pressed' (Official History) it was a complete failure, with heavy casualties.|$|E

The attack went in behind an artillery barrage moving at 100 yards in four minutes but although 'the assault was gallantly pressed' (Official History) it was a complete failure. The Germans eventually retreated as far as their new Hindenburg Line defences well beyond the Somme battlefields, but 46th Division was withdrawn from the pursuit on 17 March.|$|E

Another crash happened shortly afterwards, involving Jelle Vanendert (Lotto-Soudal), Alexey Tsatevich (Katusha) and Kévin Reza (FDJ).|$|E
500|$|Crocodilians are ectotherms, {{producing}} {{relatively little}} heat internally and relying on external sources {{to raise their}} body temperatures. The sun's heat is the main means of warming for any crocodilian, while immersion in water may either raise its temperature by conduction, or cool the animal in hot weather. The main method for regulating its temperature is behavioural. For example, an alligator in temperate regions may start the day by basking in the sun on land. A bulky animal, it warms <b>up</b> <b>slowly,</b> but at some time {{later in the day}} it moves into the water, still exposing its dorsal surface to the sun. At night it remains submerged, and its temperature slowly falls. The basking period is extended in winter and reduced in summer. For crocodiles in the tropics, avoiding overheating is generally the main problem. They may bask briefly in the morning but then move into the shade, remaining there {{for the rest of the}} day, or submerge themselves in water to keep cool. Gaping with the mouth can provide cooling by evaporation from the mouth lining. By these means, the temperature range of crocodilians is usually maintained between , and mainly stays in the range [...]|$|E
500|$|The show {{started with}} a {{performance}} by Level 42. As their performance ended, the lights started blinking all around the stadium and Finch appears on stage, looking for Madonna. He is followed by two other dancers, who jump around the stage and disappear. Then Madonna's silhouette is visible behind a screen which has paintings by Tamara de Lempicka on it. She performs dance moves behind the screen, which starts going <b>up</b> <b>slowly.</b> She wore a black pointy corset and fishnets like the costume in the music video of [...] "Open Your Heart". After dancing on the stairs, using a chair as a prop, Madonna descends and starts singing the song. Later Finch joins her again and they dance together till the song ends. This {{was followed by the}} performance of [...] "Lucky Star" [...] during which [...] a disco ball spun above the stage; as Madonna and her dancers moved around it, the light from the ball flickered on them like a star. For [...] "True Blue", Madonna came up on the stage wearing a blue, silk taffeta dress over her corset and a blue scarf hidden in her bosom. The stage had a similar blue setting like the original music video. Madonna is backed up by her singers who play her girlfriends. At the end of the song Madonna is asked to dance again by the dancer playing her man in the performance. During [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] Madonna wore a black leather jacket over her dress and walked around the stage while singing. The screen in the background showed portraits of Pope John Paul II and then-President of the U.S. Ronald Reagan, along with scenes of John Perry III's short film, The Nightmare, ending with the words [...] "Safe Sex", as Madonna finished the song. She dedicated the song to the Pope, marking her first conflict with the Vatican, as Pope John Paul II urged Italian fans to boycott her concerts.|$|E

2500|$|The uplift {{and erosion}} of the Acadian Mountains was {{occurring}} during the Devonian and early Mississippian period (395 to 325 million years ago). Over that time, thousands of feet of these sediments built <b>up,</b> <b>slowly</b> moving the Devonian seashore further west. A meteor impact occurred in the shallow sea approximately 375 mya, creating a [...] diameter crater. This crater eventually filled with sediments and became Panther Mountain {{through the process of}} uplift and erosion. By the middle of the Mississippian period, the uplift stopped, and the Acadian Mountains had been eroded so much that sediments no longer flowed across the Catskill Delta.|$|E
2500|$|Tokyo {{emerged as}} a leading {{international}} financial center (IFC) in the 1960s and {{has been described as}} one of the three [...] "command centers" [...] for the world economy, along with New York City and London. In the 2017 Global Financial Centres Index, Tokyo was ranked as having the fifth most competitive financial center in the world (alongside cities such as London, New York City, San Francisco, Chicago, Sydney, Boston, and Toronto in the top 10), and third most competitive in Asia (after Singapore and Hong Kong). The Japanese financial market opened <b>up</b> <b>slowly</b> in 1984 and accelerated its internationalisation with the [...] "Japanese Big Bang" [...] in 1998. Despite the emergence of Singapore and Hong Kong as competing financial centers, the Tokyo IFC manages to keep a prominent position in Asia, for now. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is Japan's largest stock exchange, and third largest in the world by market capitalization and fourth largest by share turnover. In 1990 {{at the end of the}} Japanese asset price bubble, it accounted for more than 60% of the world stock market value.|$|E

2500|$|Control of the {{artillery}} was centralised by an Order for the Activities of the Artillery and Mortars, which stipulated that the corps Generals of Foot Artillery {{were responsible for}} local target selection, while co-ordination of flanking fire by neighbouring corps and the fire of certain batteries, {{was determined by the}} 5th Army headquarters. French fortifications were to be engaged by the heaviest howitzers and enfilade fire. The heavy artillery was to maintain long-range bombardment of French supply routes and assembly areas; counter-battery fire was reserved for specialist batteries firing gas shells. Co-operation between {{the artillery}} and infantry was stressed, with accuracy of the artillery being given priority over rate of fire. The opening bombardment was to build <b>up</b> <b>slowly</b> and [...] (a rate of fire so rapid that the sound of shell-explosions merged into a rumble) would not begin until the last hour. As the infantry advanced, the artillery would increase the range of the bombardment to destroy the French second position. Artillery observers were to advance with the infantry and communicate with the guns by field telephones, flares and coloured balloons. When the offensive began, the French were to be bombarded continuously, harassing fire being maintained at night.|$|E
2500|$|One {{of the big}} storylines in EastEnders in 1992 was Arthur's {{infidelity}} {{with the}} lonely divorcée Christine Hewitt (Elizabeth Power). The storyline built <b>up</b> <b>slowly</b> and was conceived by the writer Tony McHale. The audience had witnessed Arthur and his wife Pauline (Wendy Richard) rowing many times, but they were generally seen as the most stable of all couples ever featured in the show, and so the storyline involving Arthur's extramarital affair came as a huge shock to viewers. The British press labelled the storyline [...] "The Bonk Of The Year" [...] and it finally reached its climax on-screen in September 1993. The scripwriters had many conferences about ways in which Pauline would {{find out about the}} affair; should she work it out herself or should some third party tell her the truth? In the end it was felt that Arthur should decide to tell her himself, which he did in a shocking episode that saw Pauline turn violent and hit Arthur in the face with a frying pan. This episode (written by Tony McHale and directed by Keith Boak) was chosen by writer Colin Brake as the episode of the year in [...]|$|E
