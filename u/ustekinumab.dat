40|$|Background: TNF-alpha antagonists may {{increase}} the risk of herpes zoster (HZ), as well as the duration and severity. Recently, the monoclonal antibody <b>ustekinumab,</b> blocking the p 40 subunit of IL- 12 and IL- 23, has been introduced for treating moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. There are no PubMed reports of HZ occurring in people receiving <b>ustekinumab</b> treatment. Common HZ was reported in clinical trials. Observation: Two patients with severe psoriasis treated with <b>ustekinumab</b> developped severe contiguous multidermatomal HZ 1 and 9 months after treatment initiation. Discussion : The occurence of HZ after the instauration of <b>ustekinumab</b> suggests a causal relationship. Indeed, the inhibition of the p 40 subunit of IL- 12 shifts the immune response towards a Th 1 profile with diminished IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha expression, decreasing the antiviral immune reponse. Conclusion : <b>Ustekinumab</b> is probably a risk factor for developing HZ. Anti-HZ vaccination prior to <b>ustekinumab</b> treatment should be considered. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{efficacy}} of etanercept and <b>ustekinumab</b> in psoriasis {{has been compared}} in one randomized controlled trial. Comparison of the long-term effectiveness of biologics in daily-practice psoriasis treatment is currently lacking. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness between the three widely used outpatient biologics adalimumab, etanercept and <b>ustekinumab</b> in daily-practice psoriasis treatment and to correct for confounders. METHODS: Data were extracted from the prospective, multicentre BioCAPTURE registry. Multilevel linear regression analyses (MLRAs) and generalized estimating equation (GEE) analyses were performed on the course of mean Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and PASI 75 (>/= 75 % reduction vs. baseline). Both models were corrected for confounders. Subgroup analyses for biological dose were performed. RESULTS: We included 356 patients with 513 treatment episodes: 178 adalimumab, 245 etanercept and 90 <b>ustekinumab.</b> MLRA showed a similar effectiveness between adalimumab, etanercept and <b>ustekinumab</b> after 1 year, but the highest effectiveness for <b>ustekinumab</b> during 5 years of treatment (P = 0. 047; <b>ustekinumab</b> vs. etanercept, P = 0. 019). GEE analysis revealed a higher chance of attaining PASI 75 with adalimumab and <b>ustekinumab</b> than with etanercept at 1 year of treatment. A higher than label dose was more often used in patients treated with etanercept (adalimumab, etanercept and ustekinumab: respectively 31. 5 %, 55. 1 % and 17 % after 1 year, P < 0. 001; 39. 3 %, 71. 4 % and 24 % after 5 years, P < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with etanercept, <b>ustekinumab</b> had the highest effectiveness during 5 years of treatment.
