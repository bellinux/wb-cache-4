5|$|Colonization with H. pylori is not {{a disease}} in and of itself, but a {{condition}} associated {{with a number of}} disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Testing for H. pylori is recommended if peptic ulcer disease or low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma is present, after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer, first-degree relatives with gastric cancer, and in certain cases of dyspepsia, not routinely. Several ways of testing exist. One can test noninvasively for H. pylori infection with a blood antibody test, stool antigen test, or with the carbon urea breath test (in which the patient drinks 14C—or 13C-labelled urea, which the bacterium metabolizes, producing labelled carbon dioxide that can be detected in the breath). Also, a urine ELISA test with a 96% sensitivity and 79% specificity is available. None of the test methods is completely failsafe. Even biopsy is dependent on the location of the biopsy. Blood antibody tests, for example, range from 76% to 84% sensitivity. Some drugs can affect H. pylori <b>urease</b> <b>activity</b> and give false negatives with the urea-based tests. The most accurate method for detecting H. pylori infection is with a histological examination from two sites after endoscopic biopsy, combined with either a rapid urease test or microbial culture.|$|E

Using differential display of reverse-transcripts of tobacco roots not-inoculated or inoculated with Glomus intraradices (Gi), we have cloned two partial cDNAs (NtGi 2 and NtGi 3). The presence of a conserved CobW/HypB/UreG domain and phylogenetic analyses suggest that NtGi 2 and NtGi 3 encode isoforms of urease accessory protein G (ureG) highly similar to ureG from fungi. The steady state levels of the putative ureG transcripts were shown to be higher in roots colonized by Gi, as compared to non-mycorrhizal controls. <b>Urease</b> <b>activities</b> were also determined in tobacco roots inoculated with Glomus clarum (Gc) or Gi and grown in substrate containing 50, 100 or 150 mg N kg- 1 {{in the form of}} ammonium sulfate (N-AMS) or urea (N-URE). <b>Urease</b> <b>activities</b> were shown to be induced in mycorrhizal roots fertilized with 100 mg N-AMS kg- 1.
