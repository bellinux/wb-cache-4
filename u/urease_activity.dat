Using differential display of reverse-transcripts of tobacco roots not-inoculated or inoculated with Glomus intraradices (Gi), we have cloned two partial cDNAs (NtGi 2 and NtGi 3). The presence of a conserved CobW/HypB/UreG domain and phylogenetic analyses suggest that NtGi 2 and NtGi 3 encode isoforms of urease accessory protein G (ureG) highly similar to ureG from fungi.
