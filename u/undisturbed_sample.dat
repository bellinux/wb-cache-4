40|$|ABSTRACT Solute {{transport}} parameters can {{be determined}} in miscible displacement experiments, usually performed in columns with disturbed (sieved) soil <b>samples.</b> Experiments with <b>undisturbed</b> <b>samples</b> are uncommon, due {{to the difficulty of}} taking <b>undisturbed</b> <b>samples</b> at the size required for these experiments. Structural alteration of the disturbed material implies modifications in the pore geometry that determines hydraulic properties, including hydraulic conductivity and retention and properties related to miscible displacement. An existing model for prediction of breakthrough curves based on retention properties was tested using material from a medium-textured Ferralsol, and alterations caused by sample disturbance were investigated. Soil water retention curves and miscible displacement parameters were determined in breakthrough experiments with nitrate salts in columns filled with undisturbed and disturbed soil samples. Data obtained from the <b>undisturbed</b> <b>samples</b> showed a higher dispersion, suggesting homogenization of pore geometry and a reduction in the representative elementary volume by the disaggregation and sieving of the soil material. The transport parameters for nitrate determined in disturbed and <b>undisturbed</b> <b>samples</b> were significantly different and the model was able to simulate the observed breakthrough curves after fitting the pore connectivity parameter...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Triaxial {{consolidation}} undrained shear {{tests were}} carried out on both undisturbed and reconstituted samples of natural silty clay to investigate their undrained shear strength characteristics. Test {{results suggest that the}} strength envelope of the <b>undisturbed</b> <b>sample</b> is composed by two straight lines, which is {{different from that of the}} strength envelopes of reconstituted samples showing a straight line through the origin. Undrained shear strength of undisturbed samples are larger than corresponding reconstituted samples due to the resistance of soil structure in the pre-yield stress state. In the post-yield stress state, however, strength envelope of the <b>undisturbed</b> <b>sample</b> lies among the reconstituted samples with different initial water contents. Undrained shear strength for undisturbed samples in the post-yield stress state and reconstituted samples can be well correlated with the water content under different confining stress, which implies that undrained shear strength mainly depends on the current water content...|$|E

30|$|It is {{necessary}} to determine the compressibility parameters of soils such as the compression index (Cc) and the recompression index (Cr) for safe and economic design of civil engineering structures. In order to calculate the consolidation settlement of normally consolidated and over-consolidated saturated fine-grained soils, the compressibility parameters are determined by means of laboratory oedometer test on <b>undisturbed</b> <b>samples</b> based on Terzaghiâs consolidation theory. These parameters can be influenced from the quality of samples used in the tests. Although the compressibility parameters must be obtained from careful oedometer test measurements based on good quality <b>undisturbed</b> <b>samples,</b> conventional oedometer test comprises major disadvantages such as costliness, unwieldiness and time-consuming. In addition, the other important disadvantage of the estimation of the compressibility parameters is that the graphical method directly depends on the personal experience. Because of these factors, many researchers have been tried to develop practical and fast solutions.|$|R
40|$|Undisturbed {{sampling}} of gold tailings, especially {{under the water}} table, is difficult {{and in many cases}} impossible. For this reason laboratory testing of tailings is generally conducted on reconstituted material. It has been shown that laboratory sample preparation methods can affect the mechanical behaviour of cohesionless soil and it is generally believed that the difference in mechanical behaviour is attributable to a difference in the fabric (particle arrangement) inherent in the preparation method. An experimental programme was conducted to (a) examine the fabric which ensues upon sample preparation and (b) to investigate the effect of any fabric differences on the mechanical behaviour of gold tailings. Comparison was made between the behaviour and fabric of undisturbed and reconstituted moist tamped and slurry deposited samples. The results from the experimental programme show that there is indeed a difference in fabric between undisturbed and reconstituted gold tailings samples. Slurry preparation generally replicates the fabric and behaviour of the <b>undisturbed</b> <b>sample</b> better than moist tamping, but neither fully replicates the <b>undisturbed</b> <b>sample.</b> At large strains, the samples reach a unique critical state friction angle, but at different stress states.

40|$|Cemented paste {{backfill}} (CPB) is {{a relatively}} new material that is increasingly being used in open stope mining across the world. The advantages offered by this high density tailings backfill include: a lower total cost associated with backfill placement, reduction of excess water underground; and the elimination of the need to process the tailings prior to placement. However, almost all backfill design is based on the performance of laboratory prepared samples since it is difficult to obtain <b>undisturbed</b> <b>samples</b> and conduct in situ testing {{due to the lack of}} access to backfilled stopes and the safety concerns in accessible areas. The logistical problems associated with conducting in situ testing and obtaining <b>undisturbed</b> <b>samples</b> of cemented paste backfill (CPB) has lead to the reliance in the mining industry on performance data obtained from laboratory prepared CPB samples. The degree to which these laboratory prepared samples represent the actual in situ condition is not well defined, partly because the influence of the mixing, transport and placement process on the material properties it is not well understood. Therefore, there is a need in the industry to understand how the material properties and hence the performance of the laboratory prepared CPB compares with in situ material.

40|$|Volumetric {{soil water}} content (theta) can be {{evaluated}} {{in the field}} by direct or indirect methods. Among the direct, the gravimetric method is regarded as highly reliable and thus often preferred. Its main disadvantages are that sampling and laboratory procedures are labor intensive, and that the method is destructive, which makes resampling of a same point impossible. Recently, the time domain reflectometry (TDR) technique has become a widely used indirect, non-destructive method to evaluate theta. In this study, evaluations of the apparent dielectric number of soils (epsilon) and samplings for the gravimetrical determination of the volumetric soil water content (thetaGrav) were carried out at four sites of a Xanthic Ferralsol in Manaus - Brazil. With the obtained epsilon values, theta was estimated using empirical equations (thetaTDR), and compared with thetaGrav derived from disturbed and <b>undisturbed</b> <b>samples.</b> The main objective {{of this study was}} the comparison of thetaTDR estimates of horizontally as well as vertically inserted probes with the thetaGrav values determined by disturbed and <b>undisturbed</b> <b>samples.</b> Results showed that thetaTDR estimates of vertically inserted probes and the average of horizontally measured layers were only slightly and insignificantly different. However, {{significant differences were found between}} the thetaTDR estimates of different equations and between disturbed and <b>undisturbed</b> <b>samples</b> in the thetaGrav determinations. The use of the theoretical Knight et al. model, which permits an evaluation of the soil volume assessed by TDR probes, is also discussed. It was concluded that the TDR technique, when properly calibrated, permits in situ, nondestructive measurements of q in Xanthic Ferralsols of similar accuracy as the gravimetric method...|$|R

The wake vortex traces, which are generated at a height of about 65 m and subsequently evolve in ground effect, are clearly visible in the velocity components and temperature.
