The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on <b>unearned</b> <b>income</b> from things such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E

Therefore, high earners pay a lower percentage of their total income because of the income caps; because of this, and the fact there is no tax on <b>unearned</b> <b>income,</b> social security taxes are often viewed as being regressive. However, benefits are adjusted to be significantly more progressive, even when accounting for differences in life expectancy.

25|$|A {{month after}} taking office, Campbell-Bannerman called a general election, {{in which the}} Liberals gained a {{landslide}} majority of 132. However, Asquith's first budget, in 1906, was constrained by the annual income and expenditure plans he had inherited from his predecessor Austen Chamberlain. The only income for which Chamberlain had over-budgeted was the duty from sales of alcohol. With a balanced budget, and a realistic assessment of future public expenditure, Asquith was able, in his second and third budgets, to lay the foundations for limited redistribution of wealth and welfare provisions for the poor. Blocked at first by Treasury officials from setting a variable rate of income tax with higher rates on those with high incomes, {{he set up a}} committee under Sir Charles Dilke which recommended not only variable income tax rates but also a super-tax on incomes of more than £5,000 a year. Asquith also introduced a distinction between earned and <b>unearned</b> <b>income,</b> taxing the latter at a higher rate. He used the increased revenues to fund old-age pensions, the first time a British government had provided them. Reductions in selective taxes, such as that on sugar, were aimed at benefiting the poor.|$|E

Webb, who chaired the board of trustees appointed to supervise the legacy, proposed to use most of it to found a school of economics and politics. Shaw demurred; he thought such a venture was contrary to the specified purpose of the legacy. He was eventually persuaded to support the proposal, and the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) opened in the summer of 1895.|$|E
500|$|Reagan's {{policies}} {{proposed that}} economic growth would occur when marginal tax rates were {{low enough to}} spur investment, which would then lead to higher employment and wages. Critics labeled this [...] "trickle-down economics"—the belief that tax policies that benefit the wealthy will create a [...] "trickle-down" [...] effect to the poor. Questions arose whether Reagan's policies benefited the wealthy more than those living in poverty, and many poor and minority citizens viewed Reagan as indifferent to their struggles. These views were exacerbated {{by the fact that}} Reagan's economic regimen included freezing the minimum wage at $3.35 an hour, slashing federal assistance to local governments by 60%, cutting the budget for public housing and Section 8 rent subsidies in half, and eliminating the antipoverty Community Development Block Grant program. The widening gap between the rich and poor had already begun during the 1970s before Reagan's economic policies took effect. Along with Reagan's 1981 cut in the top regular tax rate on <b>unearned</b> <b>income,</b> he reduced the maximum capital gains rate to 20%. Reagan later set tax rates on capital gains at the same level as the rates on ordinary income like salaries and wages, with both topping out at 28%. Reagan is viewed as an antitax hero despite raising taxes eleven times {{over the course of his}} presidency, all in the name of fiscal responsibility. According to Paul Krugman, [...] "Over all, the 1982 tax increase undid about a third of the 1981 cut; as a share of GDP, the increase was substantially larger than Mr.Clinton's 1993 tax increase." [...] According to historian and domestic policy adviser Bruce Bartlett, Reagan's tax increases over the course of his presidency took back half of the 1981 tax cut.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{models of}} labour supply {{adopting}} the collective approach have commonly used the decentralized representation and a reduced form specification of the sharing rule. This procedure has two crucial drawbacks that in principle make it inappropriate {{for the very}} same type of applications that {{are thought to be}} mostly relevant for this family of models, i. e. tax reform simulations. The first problem concerns the decentralized representation. The possibility of decentralizing the maximization of household welfare rests on the convexity of the budget sets. However, both the actual tax systems and the tax reforms might imply significant non-convexities: this makes the decentralized representation in general inappropriate both for estimation and for simulation. The second problem concerns the specification of the sharing rule, which typically is not a structural one, but rather a reduced form, e. g. a combination of exogenous variables (wage rates, <b>unearned</b> <b>incomes</b> etc.). Such a specification might provide a reasonable approximation to the current intra-household allocation choices under the current tax rule, but in general it cannot be used for simulating the effects of a different tax rule. Analogously, the sharing rule in general will be different depending on whether both partners work or not. We propose - and illustrate with some preliminary results - a model that permits the estimation of a structural sharing rule...|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Churchill's second {{proposition}} is the correlative of the first. How shall this imposing {{fabric of}} industrial security be reared and made safe?

In other words, the State in future will increasingly ask the taxpayer not only [...] "What have you got?" [...] but [...] "How did you get it?" [...] No one contends that such an analysis can be perfect; but, on the other hand, can a community desirous of realising what Goethe calls [...] "practical Christianity," [...] ignore it? And if in this process it enters the sphere of morals, as Ruskin long ago urged it to do, as well as the path of economic justice, is the step a wrong one? Has it not already been taken not only in this Budget, but in its predecessor, in which the Prime Minister made the memorable distinction between earned and <b>unearned</b> <b>income?</b> Those who answer these questions in the Liberal sense will find in these speeches a body of vigorous and persuasive reasoning on their side.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} and assesses {{trends in}} the disposable incomes of Australian families between 1982 - 83 and 1989 - 90. The paper's results {{are based on the}} 1985 - 86 Income Distribution Survey adjusted by micro-analytic simulation techniques to reflect changes in employment and earned and <b>unearned</b> <b>incomes,</b> as well as developments in the personal income tax and social security systems. A model of factors influencing mortgage repayments is also developed and used to assess trends in housing costs and in incomes after housing costs are deducted. Overall, the paper estimates the increase in median real family incomes to be around 6. 5 per cent between 1982 - 83 and 1989 - 90. Excluding farming families, this increase is reduced to only 3. 3 per cent. The family types with the smallest income growth have been single young people and couples with children, whose real median incomes have remained essentially stable over the period (for non-farming families). Real mortgage repayments for house purchasers are estimated to be an average of $ 48 per week higher in 1989 - 90 than they would be if housing and finance markets had remained unchanged. The average purchaser aged under 30 years, however, is estimated to be paying $ 79 per week more in real terms. Over all tenures, real housing costs are estimated to have increased by an average of $ 14 per week...|$|R

60|$|It {{would be}} hard to find any {{document}} in practical daily use in which these obvious truths seem so stupidly overlooked as they are in the marriage service. As we have seen, the stupidity is only apparent: the service was really only an honest attempt {{to make the best of}} a commercial contract of property and slavery by subjecting it to some religious restraint and elevating it by some touch of poetry. But the actual result is that when two people are under the influence of the most violent, most insane, most delusive, and most transient of passions, they are required to swear that they will remain in that excited, abnormal, and exhausting condition continuously until death do them part. And though of course nobody expects them to do anything so impossible and so unwholesome, yet the law that regulates their relations, and the public opinion that regulates that law, is actually founded on the assumption that the marriage vow is not only feasible but beautiful and holy, and that if they are false to it, they deserve no sympathy and no relief. If all married people really lived together, no doubt the mere force of facts would make an end to this inhuman nonsense in a month, if not sooner; but it is very seldom brought to that test. The typical British husband sees much less of his wife than he does of his business partner, his fellow clerk, or whoever works beside him day by day. Man and wife do not as a rule, live together: they only breakfast together, dine together, and sleep in the same room. In most cases the woman knows nothing of the man's working life and he knows nothing of her working life (he calls it her home life). It is remarkable that the very people who romance most absurdly about the closeness and sacredness of the marriage tie are also those who are most convinced that the man's sphere and the woman's sphere are so entirely separate that only in their leisure moments can they ever be together. A man as intimate with his own wife as a magistrate is with his clerk, or a Prime Minister with the leader of the Opposition, is a man in ten thousand. The majority of married couples never get to know one another at all: they only get accustomed to having the same house, the same children, and the same income, which is quite a different matter. The comparatively few men who work at home--writers, artists, and to some extent clergymen--have to effect some sort of segregation within the house or else run a heavy risk of overstraining their domestic relations. When the pair is so poor that it can afford only a single room, the strain is intolerable: violent quarrelling is the result. Very few couples can live in a single-roomed tenement without exchanging blows quite frequently. In the leisured classes there is often no real family life at all. The boys are at a public school; the girls are in the schoolroom in charge of a governess; the husband is at his club or in a set which is not his wife's; and the institution of marriage enjoys the credit of a domestic peace which is hardly more intimate than the relations of prisoners in the same gaol or guests at the same garden party. Taking these two cases of the single room and the <b>unearned</b> <b>income</b> as the extremes, we might perhaps locate at a guess whereabout on the scale between them any particular family stands. But it is clear enough that the one-roomed end, though its conditions enable the marriage vow to be carried out with the utmost attainable exactitude, is far less endurable in practice, and far more mischievous in its effect on the parties concerned, and through them on the community, than the other end. Thus we see that the revolt against marriage is by no means only a revolt against its sordidness as a survival of sex slavery. It may even plausibly be maintained that this is precisely the part of it that works most smoothly in practice. The revolt is also against its sentimentality, its romance, its Amorism, even against its enervating happiness.|$|E

This research utilized the Generalized Method of Moments in the estimation of the system of expenditures on food at and away from home to test the validity of the unitary model by testing one of the implications of this model, the income pooling hypothesis, as well as family financial structure. It was found that the omission of family financial structure and not the income pooling hypothesis would lead to the incorrect assertion that the unitary model is the correct model for the analysis of intrahousehold allocation. The collective models proposed in this research were found to be preferred to those of the unitary models. These two models, conditional and unconditional, not only allow for the effect of earned and <b>unearned</b> <b>incomes</b> of fathers and mothers to be different, but also incorporate family financial structure into the analysis of expenditures on food at and away from home. This research shows that the parameters of the unitary models are reduced form parameters that do not represent the effect that the variable of interest has on the household expenditures category of interest. This research finds that these reduced form parameters show the total effect which is composed of three parts. First, the change in the expenditure category of interest that comes about from a change in the variable of interest when we hold family financial structure constant. Second, the change in the expenditure category of interest that comes about from a change in the family financial structure.

5000|$|Hitler's first DAP {{speech was}} held in the Hofbräukeller on 16 October 1919. He was the second speaker of the evening and spoke to 111 people. Hitler later {{declared}} that this was when he realised he could really [...] "make a good speech". At first, Hitler spoke only to relatively small groups, but his considerable oratory and propaganda skills were appreciated by the party leadership. With the support of Anton Drexler, Hitler became chief of propaganda for the party in early 1920. Hitler began to make the party more public, and organised their biggest meeting yet of 2000 people, on 24 February 1920 in the Staatliches Hofbräuhaus in München. Such was the significance of this particular move in publicity that Harrer resigned from the party in disagreement. It was in this speech that Hitler enunciated the twenty-five points of the German Workers' Party manifesto that had been drawn up by Drexler, Feder, and Hitler. Through these points he gave the organisation a much bolder stratagem with a clear foreign policy (abrogation of The Treaty of Versailles, a Greater Germany, Eastern expansion, exclusion of Jews from citizenship), and among his specific points were: confiscation of war profits, abolition of <b>unearned</b> <b>incomes,</b> the State to share profits of land, and land for national needs to be taken away without compensation. In general, the manifesto was antisemitic, anti-capitalist, anti-democratic, anti-Marxist, and anti-liberal. To increase its appeal to larger segments of the population, on 24 February 1920, the same day as Hitler's Hofbräuhaus speech, the DAP changed its name to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist German Workers Party). That year, the Nazi Party officially announced that only persons of [...] "pure Aryan descent [...] " [...] could become party members; if the person had a spouse, the spouse also had to be a [...] "racially pure" [...] Aryan. Party members could not be related either directly or indirectly to a so-called [...] "non-Aryan". Even before it became legally forbidden by the Nuremberg Laws in 1935, the Nazis banned sexual relations and marriages between party members and Jews. Party members found guilty of Rassenschande (racial defilement) were persecuted heavily, some members were even sentenced to death.|$|R
