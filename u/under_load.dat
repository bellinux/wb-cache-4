30|$|The CVs as {{calculated}} from the amount of displacement <b>under</b> <b>loading</b> in the experimental, contact, and fixation models were about 5 % to 10 %, and all models had high reproducibility with respect to implant displacement <b>under</b> <b>loading.</b>|$|R
30|$|The CV of implant {{displacement}} was 5 % to 10 % in {{the experimental}} and FEA models <b>under</b> <b>loading</b> conditions. Absolute values of implant displacement <b>under</b> <b>loading</b> were smaller in FEA models than the experimental model, but the displacement tendency at each loading site was similar. The correlation coefficient between the experimental and contact models for implant displacement <b>under</b> <b>loading</b> was 0.925 (p[*]<[*] 0.01). The CVs of equivalent stress values in the FEA models were 0.52 % to 45.99 %.|$|R

25|$|Due to a {{more mature}} {{manufacturing}} process, the CPUs in the second-generation MacBook Air perform better <b>under</b> <b>load,</b> as the first generation chips ran at a higher temperature—the processor needed to be throttled to avoid overheating and this further degraded performance.|$|E
30|$|Regarding {{displacement}} <b>under</b> <b>loading,</b> {{a one-way}} analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to investigate statistically significant differences between the loading sites. A three-way ANOVA was used to investigate statistically significant differences in three-dimensional implant displacements <b>under</b> <b>loading</b> conditions.

25|$|A {{downwards}} {{force is}} necessary to maintain {{the position of the}} tool at or below the material surface. Some friction-stir welding machines operate <b>under</b> <b>load</b> control but in many cases the vertical position of the tool is preset and so the load will vary during welding.|$|E
25|$|The new 5.0 {{incorporates}} piston {{cooling oil}} jets that helped warm the engine faster {{and keep the}} engine running cooler <b>under</b> <b>load.</b> Racing style tubular headers replaced the standard cast iron headers. Coolant and oil flow patterns were optimized for proper flow when under high lateral forces, such as those experienced when on a road course track.|$|E
30|$|In the {{experimental}} and contact models, the absolute values of displacement <b>under</b> <b>loading</b> were different, but {{aspects of the}} displacement <b>under</b> <b>loading</b> conditions caused by differences in the loading points were similar and showed similar tendencies. The correlation coefficient of the two was 0.925, representing a significant and strong correlation (p[*]<[*] 0.01). This shows that the behavioral tendencies of the contact model are reflective of those in {{the experimental}} model and that the results obtained had high validity. The CV of the displacement <b>under</b> <b>loading</b> conditions was calculated as about 10 % in some areas of the FEA models, but the mean was about 5 % for all three models, representing a relatively low value. This suggests that all models had highly reproducible displacements <b>under</b> <b>loading</b> and that the results obtained had high validity. Although there are limitations to the reproducible range, it appears possible to infer phenomena to an extent if the properties are understood and the limitations are known. Analysis by three-dimensional finite element models {{has been shown to be}} an effective means for studying the behavioral tendencies of implants <b>under</b> <b>loading</b> conditions.|$|R

The growth of a crack retarded at about 500 µm in surface length <b>under</b> ultrasonic <b>loading,</b> while at about 20 µm under rotating bending. Although striations being a typical fracture mechanism were observed <b>under</b> conventional <b>loading,</b> most of fracture surface was covered with many facets <b>under</b> ultrasonic <b>loading.</b> These facets were also observed under rotating bending in nitrogen gas. The difference in growth mechanism depending on the loading frequency and the retardation of a crack growth <b>under</b> ultrasonic <b>loading</b> {{may be caused by}} the environment at the crack tip due to high crack growth rate <b>under</b> ultrasonic <b>loading...</b>|$|R

25|$|Locomotive J 546 was {{selected}} for installation of a Laidlaw Drew oil firing system {{in place of the}} convention weir-type burner following recommendations from the 1957 Australian and New Zealand Railway Conference.

25|$|During the {{introduction}} of the more powerful, albeit slower Y class in 1961, it was found that X class engines were susceptible to overheating when working in multiple with Y classes on slow, heavy trains. This was due to a design flaw which prevented the X class from running for a prolonged period at low speed <b>under</b> <b>load.</b> As a result, five were rewired between 1961 and 1970 to give better operation at low speed and reclassified as the XA class.|$|E

25|$|An edge tone {{occurs when}} a jet impinges on a fixed surface. A {{trailing}} edge tone {{occurs when a}}n exterior flow passes over a trailing edge. There is a whistle that {{is a combination of}} an edge tone and a trailing edge tone and might be called a wake-edge tone. It occurs in rotating circular saws under idling conditions and may be called the circular saw whistle. <b>Under</b> <b>load</b> conditions, blade vibration plays a role which is not addressed here.|$|E
25|$|The {{reinforcement}} in a RC structure, {{such as a}} steel bar, has {{to undergo}} the same strain or deformation as the surrounding concrete {{in order to prevent}} discontinuity, slip or separation of the two materials <b>under</b> <b>load.</b> Maintaining composite action requires transfer of load between the concrete and steel. The direct stress is transferred from the concrete to the bar interface so as to change the tensile stress in the reinforcing bar along its length, this load transfer is achieved by means of bond (anchorage) and is idealized as a continuous stress field that develops {{in the vicinity of the}} steel-concrete interface.|$|E
25|$|Bismuth {{significantly}} {{lowers the}} melting point and improves wettability. In presence of sufficient lead and tin, bismuth forms crystals of Sn16Pb32Bi52 with melting point of only 95°C, which diffuses {{along the grain}} boundaries and may cause a joint failure at relatively low temperatures. A high-power part pre-tinned with an alloy of lead can therefore desolder <b>under</b> <b>load</b> when soldered with a bismuth-containing solder. Such joints are also prone to cracking. Alloys with more than 47% Bi expand upon cooling, which {{may be used to}} offset thermal expansion mismatch stresses. Retards growth of tin whiskers. Relatively expensive, limited availability.|$|E

30|$|Qiu et al. (2002) tested seven {{specimens}} of RC column subjected to biaxial loading with different load paths. The interactions of biaxial deformation, <b>under</b> biaxial <b>loads,</b> {{were found to}} weaken the biaxial strength and the hysteretic energy dissipation capacity. According to the test result, although the accumulative hysteresis dissipation energy relates closely to the loading position and path length, the energy parameter of a specimen <b>under</b> biaxial <b>load</b> is apparently larger than that <b>under</b> unidirectional <b>loading.</b> The specimen damage <b>under</b> biaxial <b>loading</b> is greater than that <b>under</b> uniaxial <b>loading,</b> which agrees with {{the reduction of the}} plastic deformation capacity.|$|R

Through the {{experiment}} of eight lightweight aggregate reinforced concrete beams <b>under</b> static <b>loading</b> and fatigue loading with constant amplitudes, the deformation rule <b>under</b> fatigue <b>loading</b> was analysed, the rigidity calculation means and formulations of lightweight aggregate reinforced concrete beam <b>under</b> fatigue <b>loading</b> were also discussed...|$|R
25|$|PMMA is an {{economical}} {{alternative to}} polycarbonate (PC) when tensile strength, flexural strength, transparency, polishability, and UV tolerance {{are more important}} than impact strength, chemical resistance and heat resistance. Additionally, PMMA does not contain the potentially harmful bisphenol-A subunits found in polycarbonate. It is often preferred because of its moderate properties, easy handling and processing, and low cost. Non-modified PMMA behaves in a brittle manner when <b>under</b> <b>load,</b> especially under an impact force, and is more prone to scratching than conventional inorganic glass, but modified PMMA is sometimes able to achieve high scratch and impact resistance.|$|E
25|$|Lift {{bags are}} used to bring the load up in stages: a long chain or sling is used to connect the load to a lift bag just below the surface, which is filled to break out the load and lift it until the bag reaches the surface, then a second bag is used to bring the load up further. This {{procedure}} continues until the load has been raised sufficiently. Advantages of this method are a more controlled lift, the facility to use a larger capacity for initial breakout without risk of a runaway. Disadvantages include the requirement for divers to work {{on or near the}} lifting gear when <b>under</b> <b>load.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cadmium is a soft, {{ductile metal}} (MH 2.0) that {{undergoes}} substantial deformation, <b>under</b> <b>load,</b> at room temperature. Like zinc, {{it has a}} crystalline structure (BCN 6+6) that is slightly distorted from the ideal. The halides of cadmium, {{with the exception of}} the fluoride, exhibit a substantially covalent nature. The oxides of cadmium in its preferred oxidation state of +2, namely CdO and Cd(OH)2, are weakly amphoteric; it forms cadmates in strongly basic solutions. Cadmium forms Zintl phases such as LiCd, RbCd13 and CsCd13. When heated in air to a few hundred degrees, cadmium represents a toxicity hazard due to the release of cadmium vapour; when heated to its boiling point in air (just above 1000 K; 725 C; 1340 F; cf steel ~2700 K; 2425 C; 4400 F), the cadmium vapour oxidizes, 'with a reddish-yellow flame, dispersing as an aerosol of potentially lethal CdO particles.' Cadmium is otherwise stable in air and in water, at ambient conditions, protected by a layer of cadmium oxide.|$|E
30|$|To {{assess the}} {{reproducibility}} {{of each of}} the models, the coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated for implant displacement <b>under</b> <b>loading</b> conditions and the equivalent stress values from each of the three experimental and FEA models. To assess the validity of the FEA models, Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated for implant displacement <b>under</b> <b>loading</b> conditions in the experimental model and the contact model. Statistical processing was performed using PASW Statistics 18 (SPSS, Tokyo, Japan).|$|R
40|$|Strain is an {{important}} quantity in engineering and materials science that relates the deformation of a material to its original length as a percent.
