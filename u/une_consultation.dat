40|$|This {{paper will}} deal with the {{expression}} of discourse markers of reformulation (henceforth DMs of RF) in Italian and will consider how the medium of communication affects the frequency of use {{and the meaning of}} these markers. Broadly speaking, DMs of RF are a particular kind of discourse markers that allow the speaker to revisit a previous statement (Gulich and Kotschi, 1983, 1987; Charolles and Coltier 1986; Roulet, 1987; Rossari 1994; DelSaz Rubio, 2003; Del Satz Rubio and Fraser, 2003). DMs of RF create textual cohesion and are meant to avoid possible misunderstandings. A distinction is generally made between paraphrastic and non-paraphrastic reformulations based on the degree of semantic equivalence (Rossari, 1994). In a nutshell, paraphrastic reformulation (see Gülich and Kotschi 1983; Charolles and Coltier 1986; Gaulmyn 1987; Rossari 1994; Cuenca 2003, Cuenca and Bach 2007) is a recharacterization of the previous statement, which is considered semantically or pragmatically equivalent to the new formulation (see example 1). On the other hand, non-paraphrastic reformulations denote a change in the statement perspective from the first formulation. The latter formulation may deny the truth value of the former and retroactively subordinate it to the new formulation (see for instance example 2) (Roulet 1987; Rossari 1994). (1) [et ce soufre. ] Qui s’est qui était il est sublimé c’est à dire qu’il est vraiment euh en poudre. En poudre très très très fine (Gülich and Kotschi, 1983 : 318) [and this sulphur. ] That is, that was, it was sublimed c'est à dire that it's really mm in powder. In very very thin powder. (2) Pourquoi donnez vous à Lacan une place tellement centrale? Après tout, il y avait d’autres maîtres (Roulet, 1987 : 118) Why do you give Lancan such central places? Après tout, there were other masters. Nonetheless, the distinction between paraphrastic and non-paraphrastic reformulation is considered untenable by Del Satz and Fraser (2003), who propose a taxonomy of the most frequent types of English DMs of RF, namely explanation, rectification, conclusion and summary, which they hope to extend also to other languages. In this paper, we will show how the medium of communication affects the uses of DMs of RF. As Fraser and Del Satz point out, there are some DMs of RF which are predominantly found in the oral (e. g. to recap), whereas others are typical of written texts (e. g. to wit). In addition, we would like to test the hypothesis that the need for reformulation changes according to the medium of communication, describing how Italian is organised in this respect. We suppose that in speech reformulations are meant to overcome a speaker’s problem. The speaker reformulates because he needs to clarify, even to himself, a previous ill-formed statement. On the other hand, in written texts, reformulation is addressed to the reader. As Charolles and Coltier (1986) point out, DMs of RF are a sign of the author’s will of being well interpreted, in other words, the author assumes that what he wrote may present some conceptual difficulties and tries to render it plainer, reformulating. The present research is carried out on two corpora of Italian: the LIP corpus for spoken data and the CORIS/CODIS for written ones. The analysis is made following Cuenca and Bach's (2007) onomasiological methodology: a first manual analysis on some corpus excerpts, made in order to identify all Italian DMs of RF, is followed by the query of the results in the two corpora and by a systematic analysis. Preliminary results seem to confirm our hypothesis: we see that reformulations are much more frequent in speech than in written texts, and that the most frequent DM of RF, constant in the two modes, is cioè. Moreover, DMs of RF's relative frequencies change according to the mode, in particular, ecco, which is quite frequent in the oral as DM of RF; is only rarely employed as DM of RF in written texts, despite its high frequency of use. Conversely, anzi and ad esempio, which are little found in the oral, flourish in the written mode. References Brinton, Laurel J. (1996).

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is a {{contrastive}} analysis of reformulation markers in spoken English and Italian. Broadly speaking, reformulation markers are a particular kind of discourse markers that allow the speaker to revisit a previous statement (Gülich & Kotschi 1983; 1987; Charolles & Coltier 1986; Roulet 1987; Rossari 1994; Del Saz Rubio & Fraser 2003). Reformulation markers create textual cohesion and are meant to avoid possible misunderstandings (see examples). 1. come avviene questo passaggio di informazione cioè come si trasforma un’informazione da una lingua a un’altra [The way in which this information transmission happens cioè how information is transformed from one language to another] [LIP NA 12] 2. Do you think Shakespeare really saw all those things in / I think / I think people ever since tried to read more into it / I mean I don’t know whether he really did [ICE-GB S 1 A 22] The analysis will be carried out on two corpora comparable for the size and the type of data collected: the LIP corpus for Italian and the spoken section of ICE-GB for English. In {{the first part of this}} paper, we will perform an exploratory analysis on a sample of corpus excerpts, in order to map most of potential reformulation markers in the two languages. At this stage the comparison will be centred on the number and on the variety of expressions the two languages dispose of. Special attention will be paid to the formal characteristics of those markers (simple vs. complex forms, grammatical category, the semantic source of these expressions, etc.) In the second part of the analysis, the most frequent reformulation marker in the two languages will be analysed according to the guidelines of parametric analysis (cf. Degand & Bestgen 2004; Spooren & Degand 2010) in order to describe the kind of reformulation expressed with a particular attention to the context and co-text in which the markers occur. From the combination of the two analyses we aim to draw a clearer picture of the similarities and the differences in the use of reformulation markers in the two languages. In a preliminary pilot study, we observed that in spoken English the number of reformulation markers per million words is significantly higher than Italian (χ 2 = 441, df= 1, p= 0. 05). Also, in English the most common reformulation markers tend to be syntactically complex (e. g. I mean, you know, you see), whereas in Italian they are more likely to be single words (e. g. cioè (that is, I mean), ecco (here is), anzi (rather, indeed)). Among the 10 most frequent reformulation markers identified in the exploratory pilot study, we see that in Italian 9 of them are adverbs (ecco (here is), allora (then)) and conjunctions (insomma (after all), quindi (therefore)) and only one is a verb (diciamo (let’s say)); in contrast in English reformulation markers belong to a wider range of grammatical forms: verbs (I mean, you know), nouns (sort of, kind of) and adverbs (so, then).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although stroke {{is one of}} {{the main}} public health {{problems}} worldwide, no study of stroke incidence has been performed in Georgia, and therefore, a population-based registry was established to determine the incidence and case-fatality rates of first-ever stroke. METHODS: We identified all first-ever strokes between November 2000 and July 2003 in a defined population of 51, 246 residents in the Sanzona suburb of Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, using overlapping sources of information and standard diagnostic criteria. RESULTS: A total of 233 first-ever strokes occurred during the study period. The crude annual incidence rate was 165 (95 % CI, 145 to 188) per 100, 000 residents. The corresponding rate adjusted to the standard "world" population was 103 (95 % CI, 89 to 117). In terms of stroke subtype, the crude annual incidence rate per 100, 000 inhabitants was 89 (95 % CI, 74 to 106) for ischemic stroke, 44 (95 % CI, 34 to 57) for intracerebral hemorrhage, 16 (95 % CI, 10 to 25) for subarachnoidal hemorrhage, and 16 (95 % CI, 10 to 25) for unspecified stroke, and the corresponding case-fatality rates at 1 month were 19. 2 %, 48. 4 %, 47. 8 %, and 69. 6 %. CONCLUSIONS: The overall stroke incidence rate in an urban population of Georgia is comparable to those reported in developed countries. As for the stroke subtypes, there is an excess of hemorrhagic strokes compared with other registries. Geographical and lifestyle variations may explain these findings, whereas inadequacy of the stroke care system in Georgia might contribute to the high case-fatality.

Signalling originates from the spindle pole body (SPB), where SIN proteins are anchored by a scaffold composed of cdc 11 p and sid 4 p. Cdc 11 p links the other SIN proteins to sid 4 p and the SPB. Homologues of cdc 11 p have been identified in Saccharomyes cerevisiae (Nud 1 p) and human cells (Centriolin). We have defined functional domains of cdc 11 p by analysis of deletion mutants. We demonstrate that the C-terminal end of cdc 11 p is necessary for SPB localisation. We also show that the N-terminal domain is necessary and sufficient for signal transduction, since tethering of this domain to the SPB will substitute for cdc 11 p in SIN function...|$|E

This article describes ClassMaps Consultation, a consultation strategy that assesses the availability of protective factors and risk in school classrooms and supports interventions to strengthen these so that more {{students in the classroom}} are successful. Three underpinnings of ClassMaps Consultation are described: (a) a conceptual framework, (b) a strategy for describing and measuring the ecological characteristics of classrooms, and (c) intervention strategies that target the classroom in lieu of individual students. Then, a case example is provided to illustrate the use of ClassMaps Consultation in two classrooms. Finally, implications for school psychological practice that promotes children’s resilience and psychological wellness are presented.

40|$|L'intervention sur les organisations est une activité qui utilise largement des {{concepts}} et des modes de raisonnement propres aux sciences du comportement. Elle constitue <b>une</b> forme de <b>consultation</b> qui diffère sensiblement de celle qui se réfère aux «  classiques » en administration et aux méthodes de la recherche opérationnelle. Chaque intervention s'insère dans une séquence pour constituer un programme intégré de développement organisationnel. L'auteur de cet article présente le modèle de développement utilisé par le Centre de formation et de consultation (CDE) et donne un compte-rendu des résultats obtenus à ce four dans une entreprise québécoise 1. 1 Nous tenons à remercier Messieurs Raymond Tremblay et Guy Darveau du Centre de formation et de consultation pour avoir revisé la partie théorique de ce texte et la direction de l'entreprise Groupe Commerce pour avoir répondu aux questions posées. Organization {{development can}} be {{looked upon as}} a strategy for introducing and maintaining change. Organization development is {{a particular kind of}} consulting work drawing heavily on the behavioral sciences, while traditional consultation makes use of work simplification and structural design principles and techniques. The Centre de formation et de consultation (CFC), a service of a management association in Québec, is conducting a series of organization development activities in some Québec business and administrative units in the public sector. The CFC in its consulting work follows a particular approach based on the same assumptions laid down by Edgar H. Schein, well-known in the field of organizational psychology. Professor Schein's approach emphasizes processes such as leadership, authority relationships, communications, intergroup competition, etc. This approach is called « process consultation » and is defined as a « set of activities {{on the part of the}} consultant which help the client to perceive, understand and act upon process events which occur in the client's environment » (Edger H. Schein,Process Consultation:its rôle in organization development, p. 9). Keeping these premises in mind, the CFC consultants has developed a model of organization development, which permits identification of the phases, the techniques used, the results which can be anticipated from each phase, and the techniques for evaluating them. The program, which is conducted according to this model, includes the following phases : 1. — To establish a stable relationship between the consultants and the client-system ; 2. — To identify the need for change and develop a motivation to make changes (the unfreezing phase)  ; 3. — To diagnose the existing situation ; 4. — To build a program for change in the short and long run ; 5. — To carry out the changes ; 6. — To stabilize the changes (the freezing phase)  ; 7. — To maintain readiness for subsequent changes. The model has been used at the Group Commerce, a family business in the field of general insurance, employing from five to six hundred people. This paper is brief summary of what has been accomplished and the result obtained so far at the Group Commerce. Initial contacts were established in 1967, followed by two sessions attended by top and middle management. These sessions dealt with sensitivity to groups functionning and decision-making, with styles of administration and their appropriateness to various administrative situations. In April 1969, the top-management and the consultants decided to proceed to a diagnosis of the situation existing at that time in order to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the organization. For this propose, two questionnaires were worked out and administered : one for middle and lower management, and one for the employees. The data so collected were computed and analysed in the light of Herzberg's two-factor theory dealing with motivation and hygienic factors. The data collection and interpretation were completed by the end of August 1969. Meetings were held with management in October 1969. The purpose of these meetings was to communicate and explain the findings of the attitude survey and establish a consensus among top and middle managers on the validity of the findings. In late Fall 1969 and early 1970, the Company engaged in the long-run programming phase while carrying out changes identified as short-run priorities. Even though the development programs has not been completed, it is now possible to report on some changes that occurred in line with anticipated results for each phase. An increase in interpersonal competence and a greater skill in diagnosing administrative situations were expected from the « arousal » phase. A questionnaire was sent to the top and middle managers who attended the sessions. Most of the participants believe they made progress in acquiring or improving their skill in understanding others and developing authenticity in their relationship with them. They think they have a better knowledge of team functionning and the inner workings of an organization. However, when we asked the participants whether their neighbours or colleagues had observed these personal changes, they replied positively but in a smaller proportion. Generally speaking, the participants tended to perceive themselves as having made more progress than their colleagues or other participants in the same organization, ie., Group Commerce. The majority of them also believe they have increased their ability to identify the needs for changes and implement them. Once the findings of the diagnosis were known to top management, a willingness to accept the data developed and a consensus followed on pointing out some aspects of the situation requiring immediate changes. Arriving at a consensus on identifying choices to be made was a condition for maintaining the development program. Results of this program can also be measured in terms of changes carried out so far and, changes that are presently being programmed over the long-run, and induced changes, that is, modifications that could not be attributed to a particular phase. In order to collect information on the actions taken by management, a series of interviews was conducted with ten top managers. Without going into detail, it is possible, at least, to classify and list these changes in the following way : 1. — Changes completed so far :     — structural changes : the removal of one authority layer and the fusion of some tasks ;     — reallocation of personnel ;     — remodelling of the planning committee and the top and middle management committee ;     — a greater decentralization of personnel management. 2. — Changes sought over the long-run :     — a revision of management philosophy towards a greater participation of middle and lower management in policy-making and decision-making ;     — a redefinition of the goals of the organization. 3. — Changes that are induced or that evolved with the unfolding of the organization development program :     — changes in the styles of management from a paternalistic consideration for people to having them accept greater responsibilities at all levels.      — changes in the level of interpersonal competence. These were the most important changes that could be traced back through the interviews with top management. Questions were also asked to the impediments to effective organization improvement, and also conditions which increase the success of a program of this kind. The following conditions could be identified in the course of the interviews : 1. — Top management support ; 2. — The kind of interventions made by the consultants ; 3. — The extent to which the participants at the arousal phase could assimilate the material presented ; 4. — External conditions, such as the tumultuous changes that characterized the last decade in the Province of Québec. From this case study, we could learn much about introducing readiness for change within an organization and the way change can be maintained, but we still have to learn more by proceeding further, by reporting numerous and diversified case studies so that comparisons can be made, measurement techniques improved, and conditions for success ascertained...|$|R
