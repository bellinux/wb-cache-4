[...] The discovery <b>of</b> a <b>detailed</b> <b>ledger</b> <b>of</b> the Syndicate's police payoffs during a raid on the home of Silver associate Jimmy Humphreys led to the dismissal or forced retirement of hundreds of Metropolitan Police officers; corruption trials in 1976-77 resulted in thirteen detectives—including two ex-Commanders, the highest-ranking British police officers ever to be convicted of corruption—being sentenced to a total of 90 years in prison.|$|R

40|$|The {{translational}} friction coefficients and intrinsic viscosities of four globular proteins (ribonuclease A, lysozyme, myoglobin, and chymotrypsinogen A) {{are calculated}} using atomic-level structural <b>details.</b> Inclusion <b>of</b> a 0. 9 -Angstrom-thick hydration shell allows calculated results for both hydrodynamic properties of each protein to reproduce experimental data. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>detailed</b> protein structures {{is made possible}} by relating translational friction and intrinsic viscosity to capacitance and polarizability, which can be calculated easily. The 0. 9 -Angstrom hydration shell corresponds to a hydration level of 0. 3 - 0. 4 g water/g protein. Hydration levels within this narrow range are also found {{by a number of}} other techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, calorimetry, and computer simulation. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>detailed</b> protein structures in predicting hydrodynamic properties thus allows hydrodynamic measurement to join the other techniques in leading to a unified picture of protein hydration. in contrast, earlier interpretations of hydrodynamic data based on modeling proteins as ellipsoids gave hydration levels that varied widely from protein to protein and thus challenged the existence of a unified picture of protein hydration...|$|R
