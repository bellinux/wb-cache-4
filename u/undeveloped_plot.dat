50|$|Patpong {{gets its}} name from the family that owns much of the area's property, the Patpongpanich (or Patpongpanit), {{immigrants}} from Hainan Island, China, who purchased the area in 1946. At that time it was an <b>undeveloped</b> <b>plot</b> of land {{on the outskirts of the}} city. A small klong (canal) and a teakwood house were the only features. The family built a road - now called Patpong 1 - and several shophouses, which were rented out. Patpong 2 was added later, and both roads are in fact private property and not city streets. (The so-called Patpong 3 and Soi Thaniya are not owned by the Patpongpanich family.) The old teak house was torn down long ago and the klong was filled in to make room for more shophouses. Originally simply an ordinary business area, the coming of the bars eventually would drive out most of the other businesses.|$|E
5000|$|After a bitterly fought {{municipal}} election in 1865 (in which {{the chairman of}} the Building and Improvement Committee lost his seat) Bradford Council introduced a revised building bylaw in 1866. This again allowed building of back to backs but imposed very stringent standards for space, ventilation sanitation and paving. The typical houses built under this bylaw were [...] "tunnel back to backs". They had 2 or 3 bedrooms and usually a [...] "side scullery". The <b>undeveloped</b> <b>plots</b> were rapidly filled up. In 1870 a third Building Bylaw set minimum street widths. After 1870 no more planning applications for back to backs were approved but the Bradford builders had such a stock of approvals that back to backs were still being build into the 1890s. In the early 1870s a triangle of land between Rouse Fold, Prospect Foundry and the Bowling curves railway was filled by two new streets - Prospect Street and Oliver Street - lined with houses of this type. The 125 houses were the last significant example of Victorian house building in Broomfields. About 1,500 working class houses and 65 cellar dwellings had been built in 25 years - but there was little space for further expansion.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} inadequate urban planning on municipal solid waste management (MSWM) in the Niger Delta Region (NDR) of Nigeria. The continuous migration and high concentration of people, administration and industrial activities in the region {{with little or no}} implementation of urban planning procedures during the development of the settlements in the region has contributed to increase the problem of MSWM in the NDR. It is not uncommon to see streets, roads, <b>undeveloped</b> <b>plots</b> of land and drains littered with solid waste in most Niger Delta cities, towns and communities. The data for this research were gathered from field surveys, observations, questionnaires as well as desktop information from published materials. Chi-Square statistical method was used in the analysis of the correlation data. The results show that there is a strong relationship between inadequate waste collection and the existence of unplanned settlements in the region. The study also revealed that indiscriminate waste disposal is strongly linked with the existence of unplanned settlements in the NDR of Nigeria. Therefore, the implementation of urban planning procedures and inclusion of waste management during the building and development of cities, towns and villages in the Niger Delta should be taking as a matter of high priority if cities in the region are to be clean and free from wastes and environmental pollution...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{considerable}} body {{of research on the}} effect of land use regulations on property values. However, less work has been done on the relationships surrounding tax revenue, small zoning changes, and the fiscal outlook of cities and counties. As a result, {{the purpose of this study}} is to examine the property tax receipts for local governments that result from different residential zoning designations. In particular, it focuses on an <b>undeveloped</b> <b>plot</b> within Corvallis, Oregon to determine whether changing this land from low-density to medium-density use would have any financial implications for the city and county. Using property sales data from the Benton County Assessor’s Office, linear regression is used to investigate this issue. Under this approach, I find that a low-density housing development would add more to market value on the same plot of land, but it would only provide a modest tax revenue advantage over a medium-density apartment complex in the first year after construction...|$|E

50|$|Gambelia sila, {{also known}} as the blunt-nosed leopard lizard, is listed as a federal {{endangered}} species and is listed by the State of California as an endangered species and fully protected species. This species is thought to have declined as a result of habitat destruction and habitat fragmentation caused by development and habitat modification. This lizard used to be found in all of the San Joaquin Valley and the adjacent foothills of southern California. The Blunt-nosed leopard lizard now only occupies a few, scattered, <b>undeveloped</b> <b>plots</b> of land {{on the floor of the}} San Joaquin Valley and in the foothills of the Coast Range. San Joaquin Valley is a desert experiencing an ecological shift due to invasive species of non-native annual grasses most likely spread by grazing cows. The blunt-nosed leopard lizard along with other small terrestrial vertebrates are declining due to the ecological changes of the San Joaquin Valley as it is hypothesized that the invasive plants are altering vegetative structure. Although cattle may have originally been a factor in the establishment of these invasive species of plants, it was discovered by David Germano et al. that continued grazing, in order to keep the spread of the grasses limited, allowed for an increase in population size of not only the blunt-nosed leopard lizard, but other suffering species of the Valley as well.|$|R
40|$|Urban {{agriculture}} {{can have}} many different expressions, varying from backyard gardening to poultry and livestock farming. This {{article focuses on}} crop production on larger open spaces in cities of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and investigates the sustainability and dynamics {{of this type of}} land use, which is common on <b>undeveloped</b> <b>plots</b> particularly in lowlands, such as in inland valleys, or along urban streams or drains. An adapted version of the Framework for Evaluating Sustainable Land Management (FESLM) developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) was used to assess the sustainability of urban agriculture. As an example for dynamics, the spatio-temporal changes of open-space agriculture in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, are analyzed for the period from 1992 to 2005, and compared with data from other cities. Crop production on urban open spaces appears as a market-driven, highly productive and profitable phenomenon. However, it is often constrained by tenure insecurity and non-agricultural land demands. Also, the common use of polluted water limits the official support of irrigated urban farming. However, despite these constraints, the phenomenon of urban farming appears persistent and resilient to its changing environment, although individual farmers might have to shift to other sites when their plots are needed for construction. Open-space vegetable production in urban areas is a dynamic, viable and largely sustainable livelihood strategy, especially for poor urban dwellers. Spatio-temporal analysis shows {{that it is not a}} short-lived or transitional phenomenon - probably as long as it can maintain its comparative market advantage. However, its informal nature and resulting lack of political recognition need to be addressed...|$|R
