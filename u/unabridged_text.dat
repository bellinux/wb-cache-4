40|$|Background. Even {{though the}} {{interpretation}} of natural language messages is generally conceived {{as the result of}} a conscious processing of the message content, the influence of unconscious factors is also well known. What is still insufficiently known is the way such factors work. We have tackled interpretation assuming it is a process, whose basic features are the same for the whole humankind, and employing a naturalistic approach (careful observation of phenomena in conditions the closest to “natural” ones, and precise description before and independently of data statistical analysis). Methodology. Our field research involved a random sample of 102 adults. We presented them with a complete real world-like case of written communication using <b>unabridged</b> message <b>texts.</b> We collected data (participants’ written reports on their interpretations) in controlled conditions through a specially designed questionnaire (closed and opened answers); then, we treated it through qualitative and quantitative methods. Principal Findings. We gathered some evidence that, in written message interpretation, between reading and the attribution of conscious meaning, an intermediate step could exist (we named it “disassembling”) which looks like an automatic reaction to the text words/expressions. Thus, the process of interpretation would be a discontinuous sequence of three steps having different natures: the initial “decoding” step (i. e., reading, which requires technical abilities), disassembling (the automatic reaction, an unconscious passage) and the final conscious attribution of meaning. If this is true, words and expressions would firstly function like physical stimuli, before being taken into account as symbols. Such hypothesis, once confirmed, could help explaining some links between the cultural (human communication) and the biological (stimulus-reaction mechanisms as the basis for meanings) dimension of humankind...|$|R

We show here why the various criticism raised are either irrelevant or erroneous. Thus, the conclusions reached by Shaviv & Veizer [2003] are still valid. In particular, the dominant climate driver on the multi-million year time scale is the variable cosmic-ray flux. CO 2 is important, but it likely plays a secondary {{role in determining}} the climate. An abridged reply to the Rahmstorf et al. critique was accepted and will soon be published in Eos.

40|$|A True Account of the Great Tryals and Cruel Sufferings Undergone by Those Two Faithful Servants of God Katherine Evans and Sarah Cheevers, London 1663. The vicessitudes of two Quaker women {{prisoner}} of the Inquisition in Malta] The book describes {{the adventures of}} two Quaker women, Sarah Cheevers and Katherine Evans, who left England {{at the end of}} 1658 for Alexandria with the aim of publishing the gospel of the “Light within” in Egypt. They arrived in Malta and were arrested and tried by the Holy Office of the Island, headed at that time by the future Cardinal Girolamo Casanate. The two women remained in prison for more than three and half years and, eventually, were released in 1663, possibly thanks to the intervention of the Jansenist d’Aubigny, Lord Almoner to Queen Henrietta Maria. Between the end of 1661 {{and the beginning of the}} following year, the Quaker Daniel Baker went to the Island to pursue Evans and Cheevers’ cause. In 1662, a little before the two women were released, Baker published in London a report of their arrest and of their detention, based on the documents and the accounts given to him by the two Quakers: This is a short Relation of some of the Cruel Sufferings (For the Truths sake) of Katharine Evans and Sarah Cheevers in the Inquisition of the Isle of Malta. The book was republished in London in 1663, perhaps edited by Evans herself, just after her and her companion’s return to England, with the title A True Account of the Great Tryals and cruel Sufferings undergone by those two faithful Servants of God Katherine Evans and Sarah Cheevers. The volume of 1663 also included the story of what happened to the two women after the departure of Daniel Baker and, as a kind of appendix, two theological texts written by Evans and Cheevers, and the account of the misadventures of a young Quaker missionary in the Holy Land. The book, edited by Stefano Villani is organized in three parts: In the first part, the story of the two women is reconstructed from the extensive research undertaken by Villani in Italy, Malta and England.

Observers reported that Douglas could not bear it when he learned that the letter was addressed to him and heard its full contents. Once during the reading he simply disappeared, and was roundly rebuked by the judge. Parts of the text were published subsequently in the London papers.

And when she discovers a mysterious fragment of parchment and an antiquated portrait in her father's desk, she becomes convinced that she is a heroine and an heiress, and that the farmer is not her father, but instead an assassin with designs upon her life. Renaming herself Cherubina, she deserts her home and sets off on a mad romp across England, determined to recover her lost domains and unravel her true parentage. But after a series of madcap and hilarious adventures, she comes to find that modern-day English law and society do not always permit a young lady to behave like a character out of a romantic tale. And when a handsome but dissolute young actor learns of Cherry's father's wealth and her mania for Gothic novels and styles himself Lord Montmorenci in an attempt to deceive her into a marriage, Cherubina will need all of her heroine's wit to defeat the nefarious plot!

40|$|Motivated by the Randall-Sundrum brane-world scenario, {{we discuss}} the {{classical}} and quantum dynamics of a (d+ 1) -dimensional boundary wall between a pair of (d+ 2) -dimensional topological Schwarzschild-AdS black holes. We assume there are quite general [...] but not completely arbitrary [...] matter fields living on the boundary ``brane universe'' and its geometry is that of an Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model. The effective action governing the model in the mini-superspace approximation is derived. We find {{that the presence of}} black hole horizons in the bulk gives rise to a complex action for certain classically allowed brane configurations, but that the imaginary contribution plays no role in the equations of motion. Classical and instanton brane trajectories are examined in general and for special cases, and we find a subset of configuration space that is not allowed at the classical or semi-classical level; these correspond to spacelike branes carrying tachyonic matter. The Hamiltonization and Dirac quantization of the model is then performed for the general case; the latter involves the manipulation of the Hamiltonian constraint before it is transformed into an operator that annihilates physical state vectors. The ensuing covariant Wheeler-DeWitt equation is examined at the semi-classical level, and we consider the possible localization of the brane universe's wavefunction away from the cosmological singularity. This is easier to achieve for branes with low density and/or spherical spatial sections. Comment: Shortened to match version accepted by Phys. Rev.

40|$|After the Restoration of the English monarchy in {{the person}} of Charles II in 1660, the new king and his first Parliament {{declared}} the anniversary of the beheading of his father Charles I (January 30, 1649) a religious holiday with a special commemoration in the Book of Common Prayer, naming the late monarch a saint and martyr. This holiday was not generally celebrated in Massachusetts until the emergence of several Anglican churches there in the early eighteenth century. In 1750, Jonathan Mayhew, the twenty-nine-yearold pastor of the West (Congregational) Church in Boston, took occasion to dispute the first Charles’ credentials to saintship, martyrdom, and even his kingship as well. Mayhew’s Discourse is an extremely interesting bridge between the radical Puritan past and the American Revolutionary future. His sermon contains the language, rhetoric, symbolism, typology, and religious and philosophical arguments that would be used extensively in the agitation for American independence twenty-five years later. Mayhew (1720 - 1766) would subsequently take {{a leading role in the}} resistance to the Stamp Act of 1765, and his sermons and writings had an enormous impact on the evolution of New England Puritanism into American republican ideology.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with one chapter of the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinayavastu namely Poṣadhasthāpanavastu. There are four different sections of this thesis: the diplomatic edition of Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya Poṣadhasthāpanavastu, the Tibetan comparative edition, a translation, and an analysis {{in comparison with the}} Pāli Khandhaka. The diplomatic Edition of MSVP is made based on the Gilgit manuscript dated around seventh to tenth century CE. There are three different xylographs compared of Tibetan poṣadhasthāpanavastu, i. e., Derge, Lhasa and sTog. The comparison between MSVP and Pākh. Kd made clear that there are some significant differences in the two parts that I have inspected in detail. Regarding the uddāna, I found the reason why they put two uddāna in MSVP. The uddāna used by Mūlasarvāstivādin are very different from that of Pāli tradition. It might well be that Mūlasarvāstivādin uddāna served as a reference to the <b>unabridged</b> <b>text,</b> enabling the readers to find that sūtra, in contrast to the Pāli tradition that uses uddāna for the sake of reciting and memorizing. As for the grounds of suspension, I found that both traditions base their grounds of accusation with the āpatti prescribed in the vinaya and the vipatti. These vinaya rules are also connected and can be grouped into those vipattis too. However, there are two vipattis that need to take into account differently that is to say, śīlavipatti and dṛṣṭivipatti. Practically, only śīlavipatti seems to be the core grounds of suspension; nonetheless, it is not likely we will have the suspension of uposatha/poṣadha nowadays...|$|E
