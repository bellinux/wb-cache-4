50|$|Salpingitis isthmica nodosa, {{also known}} as diverticulosis of the Fallopian tube, is nodular {{thickening}} of the narrow part of the <b>uterine</b> <b>tube,</b> due to inflammation. It is abbreviated SIN.|$|E

50|$|The broad {{ligament}} {{serves as}} a mesentery for the uterus, ovaries, and the <b>uterine</b> <b>tubes.</b> It helps in maintaining the uterus in its position, {{but it is not}} a major contributing factor.|$|R
5000|$|The mesosalpinx {{is part of}} {{the lining}} of the {{abdominal}} cavity in higher vertebrates, specifically the portion of the broad ligament that stretches from the ovary {{to the level of the}} <b>uterine</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{mesometrium}} is the mesentery of the uterus. It {{constitutes the}} majority of the broad ligament of the uterus, excluding only the portions adjacent to the <b>uterine</b> <b>tube</b> (the mesosalpinx) and ovary (the mesovarium).|$|E
5000|$|The ovarian {{ligament}} {{is composed}} of muscular and fibrous tissue; it extends from the uterine extremity of the ovary to the lateral aspect of the uterus, just below {{the point where the}} <b>uterine</b> <b>tube</b> and uterus meet.|$|E
30|$|The eponymous name—Fallopian tube—is {{named after}} Gabriel Fallopius: Italian anatomist (1523 – 62), the same anatomist who gave {{his name to}} the Fallopian {{ligament}} and the Fallopian canal [15]. The <b>uterine</b> <b>tubes</b> are paired, tubular uterine appendages located bilaterally at the superior portion of the <b>uterine</b> cavity. These <b>tubes</b> exit the uterus through an area {{referred to as the}} cornua, forming a connection between the endometrial and peritoneal cavities. The Fallopian tubes situated in the upper margins of the broad ligaments between the round and utero ovarian ligaments. The primary function of the <b>uterine</b> <b>tubes</b> is to transport sperm toward the egg, which is released by the ovary, and to then allow passage of the fertilized egg back to the uterus for implantation [16].|$|R
50|$|Fallopian tube {{obstruction}} is a {{major cause}} of female infertility. Blocked fallopian tubes are unable to let the ovum and the sperm converge, thus making fertilization impossible. Fallopian Tubes are also known as oviducts, <b>uterine</b> <b>tubes,</b> and salpinges (singular salpinx).|$|R
50|$|The Fallopian tubes, {{also known}} as <b>uterine</b> <b>tubes</b> or salpinges (singular salpinx), are two very fine tubes lined with ciliated epithelia, leading from the ovaries of female mammals into the uterus, via the uterotubal junction. In non-mammalian vertebrates, the {{equivalent}} structures are called oviducts.|$|R
50|$|The epoöphoron {{lies in the}} mesosalpinx {{between the}} ovary and the <b>uterine</b> <b>tube,</b> and {{consists}} of a few short tubules, the ductuli transversi which converge toward the ovary while their opposite ends open into a rudimentary duct, the ductus longitudinalis epoöphori (duct of Gärtner).|$|E
50|$|Vesicular {{appendages}} of the epoophoron {{are small}} pedunculated vesicles of the fimbriae of the <b>uterine</b> <b>tube,</b> or {{connected to the}} broad ligament. They were described by Giovanni Battista Morgagni and are remnants of the cranial part of the mesonephric duct. Typically they are asymptomatic.|$|E
50|$|The uterotubal {{junction}} or utero-tubal junction is {{the connection}} between the endometrial cavity of the uterus and the fallopian tube (<b>uterine</b> <b>tube)</b> at the proximal tubal opening, the beginning of the intramural part of the fallopian tube. Histologically, the endometrial epithelium changes over to the ciliated tubal epithelium.|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} study we produced acute salpingitis and parametritis in grivet monkeys by inoculation of Mycoplasma hominis directly into the <b>uterine</b> <b>tubes.</b> With the purpose of examining in the same animal model the effect of more natural routes of infection, six female grivet monkeys were inoculated, two by two, with M. hominis by the following methods: (experiment A) into the uterine cavity through the cervical canal; (experiment B) into the uterine cavity by the same route, but after ligature of the isthmus of the <b>uterine</b> <b>tubes</b> had been performed and followed by curettage of the endometrium; and (experiment C) into the cervical epithelium. Whereas the animals in experiment A developed no or only very slight signs of infection, all monkeys in experiments B and C developed pronounced gross and microscopic inflammatory lesions of the <b>uterine</b> <b>tubes</b> and parametria, together with a significant antibody response. It is concluded that ascending M. hominis infection of the genital tract must be preceded by mechanical injury of the epithelial barrier, and that subsequent spread of the infection occurs via blood and lymph vessels {{rather than by the}} canalicular route. The inflammatory genital tract disease produced experimentally with M. hominis in grivet monkeys is very similar in its pathogenesis and pathology to the type of salpingitis caused in humans by microorganisms other than Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to determine fertilization rates and embryonal recovery and to evaluate aspects of the early embryonal development. Eleven adult female dogs were used, with no defined breed. After {{the beginning of the}} natural estrus, these were mated and subjected to ovariohisterectomy on the 5 th, 7 th or 9 th day postcoitus. Ovaries, <b>tubes</b> and <b>uterine</b> horns were separated. From the ovaries, the number of corpora lutea was determined. <b>Tubes</b> and <b>uterine</b> horns were washed separately in order to collect ovules and embryos, which were identified {{through the use of a}} stereomicroscope at 15 x magnification. The fertilization rate was 94 % and embryonal recovery 68. 5 %. On the fifth day, postcoitus embryos of up to eight cells were found in <b>uterine</b> <b>tubes.</b> Morulae or blastocysts were observed in uterine horns from the 9 th day after recovery. On the basis of these results, it was concluded that the loss of structures can be due to the failure of their uptake by <b>uterine</b> <b>tubes</b> or during the execution of the technique. A high fertilization rate can be achieved even with the use of a single covering. It was also concluded that the embryonal development in <b>uterine</b> <b>tubes</b> had a duration of up to five days postcoitus with a stage of up to eight cells, embryos being found in stages of morulae in uterine horns nine days postcoitus...|$|R
30|$|In {{the case}} of non-patency of <b>uterine</b> <b>tubes,</b> which makes the {{instillation}} of saline into the pelvic cavity impossible, transvaginal puncture set is used under the ultrasonographic control, to allow exposition of the posterior fornix by instillation of water via an aspiration needle Fig.  7. The presence of follicular fluid during ovulation sometimes is quite enough for ultrasonographic orientation in the situation.|$|R
5000|$|Small {{branches}} {{are given}} to the ureter and the <b>uterine</b> <b>tube,</b> and one passes on {{to the side of}} the uterus, and unites with the uterine artery.

50|$|The distal tubal opening (or {{abdominal}} ostium) is {{the opening}} in the infundibulum of <b>uterine</b> <b>tube</b> into the abdominal cavity. In ovulation, the oocyte enters the Fallopian tube through this opening.It is surrounded by fimbriae, which help {{in the collection of}} the oocyte. Occlusion of this opening is referred to as distal tubal occlusion.|$|E
50|$|It is {{triangular}} in shape, {{the base}} being {{formed by the}} internal surface of the fundus between the orifices of the <b>uterine</b> <b>tubes,</b> the apex by the internal orifice of the uterus through which the cavity of the body communicates with the canal of the cervix.

50|$|In females, the paramesonephric ducts {{give rise}} to the uterine tubes, uterus, and upper portion of the vagina, while the mesonephric ducts {{degenerate}} due {{to the absence of}} male androgens. In contrast, the paramesonephric ducts begin to proliferate and differentiate in a cranial-caudal progression to form the aforementioned structures. During this time, the single-layered paramesonephric duct epithelium differentiates into other structures, ranging from the ciliated columnar epithelium in the <b>uterine</b> <b>tube</b> to stratified squamous epithelium in the vagina.|$|E
50|$|Paramesonephric ducts (or Müllerian ducts) are paired ducts of {{the embryo}} that {{run down the}} lateral sides of the {{urogenital}} ridge and terminate at the sinus tubercle in the primitive urogenital sinus. In the female, they will develop to form the <b>uterine</b> <b>tubes,</b> uterus, cervix, and the upper one-third of the vagina; in the male, they are lost. These ducts are made of tissue of mesodermal origin.|$|R
