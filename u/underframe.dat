5|$|Van 23 - now {{restored}} and being prepared (2014) for service at Woody Bay - was built at Pilton by the L Unlike all other L stock, its <b>underframe</b> was entirely made of wood.|$|E
5|$|Little {{original}} {{rolling stock}} survives, but {{as well as}} the heritage coaches mentioned below, the largely restored Van 23 was on display at Woody Bay until being removed to the L restoration team in Essex in November 2013, for refurbishment and the fitting of brakes, <b>underframe</b> and couplers. The remains of several other coaches and Goods Van 4 are in storage awaiting reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|The {{body for}} coach 17 {{was built in}} 1911, by local firm Shapland and Petter, and mounted on a steel <b>underframe</b> {{constructed}} by the railway in its own workshops at Pilton. Marginally longer than the earlier coaches, it contained both smoking and non-smoking accommodation for first and third class passengers, {{as well as the}} brake van space.|$|E
50|$|By 1996, most of {{the early}} {{numbered}} vans had been scrapped. <b>Underframes</b> were being used to replace older <b>underframes</b> under tank wagons.|$|R
50|$|With {{the success}} of the Korean-built bogies on the Northerner cars, the Endeavour cars were later fitted with this type of bogie. Work on Endeavour car <b>underframes</b> was not as {{substantial}} as that carried out on the Northerner <b>underframes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} 15 original series {{cars were}} withdrawn in late 2005 due to corrosion in the <b>underframes,</b> these cars had low-carbon mild steel <b>underframes</b> {{instead of the}} stainless steel used on later batches. DMT 9204 was subsequently destroyed in an emergency services training exercise on 25 November 2008.|$|R
5|$|The open {{goods wagons}} were {{originally}} delivered {{with a single}} top-hung side door on each side, but these proved inefficient, and all were eventually converted to side hung double doors. By 1907, most had been fitted with tarpaulin rails. The goods vans used the same <b>underframe,</b> and were fitted with double sliding doors on each side.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the Classes 59 and 66 (solid girder <b>underframe)</b> the Class 60s have a {{monocoque}} {{stressed skin}} construction with diagonal trusses - with the external bodywork providing {{support for the}} internal components.|$|E
25|$|The {{trailers}} {{were constructed}} principally of aluminium alloy on a steel <b>underframe.</b> The cars were arranged internally with two saloons separted by {{male and female}} toilets. Entrance doors and vestibules were provided at each end.|$|E
50|$|The {{trailers}} had wooden <b>underframes</b> {{as well as}} wooden bodywork. This {{proved to}} be insufficiently robust, resulting in their premature withdrawal. The B Stock motor cars (with steel <b>underframes)</b> were therefore modified as trailers in the early 1920s, the electrical equipment being used for new G Stock motor cars.|$|R
50|$|Between 1969 and 1972 the <b>underframes</b> were strengthened. Some records mention 'new underframe' in the {{modifications}} but {{observation of}} the same vehicles much later still showed the extensions that took place when the <b>underframes</b> were used for Swingdoors. The modifications {{appear to have been}} new end sills and strengthened centre beams.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} carriages used on {{the line}} were made by David King, who was the engineer who built Edmund Hannay. They were two open carriages and two covered carriages with wooden bodies on steel <b>underframes.</b> In 1998, four new covered carriages were made by Alan Keef. These have steel bodies on steel <b>underframes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Two-stage {{air-conditioning}} {{was fitted}} for summer, and heating elements placed underneath the carpet for winter. Those systems, {{along with those}} for lighting and announcements, were powered by three-phase alternators, fixed to the <b>underframe</b> of each carriage. These required refuelling, but were cheaper and more reliable than the axle-driven generators used most earlier vehicles.|$|E
25|$|The 2600 Class were {{effectively}} {{identical to}} the GNR(I) cars in overall configuration, having a full-width driver's cab at one end, a gangway at the other, and underfloor engines. Their bodywork was conventional for CIÉ stock of the time, consisting of steel panels on timber framing. The <b>underframe</b> was of steel channel construction.|$|E
25|$|The report {{considered}} it surprising {{that there had}} been only eight deaths in the leading seven passenger coaches of the Liverpool train; some of these coaches were built to a new British Railways standard (all-steel construction, with buck-eye couplings and bodies welded to the <b>underframe)</b> and seemed to have fared better than older stock.|$|E
5000|$|British Rail Class 144 - on <b>underframes</b> by British Rail Engineering Limited ...|$|R
50|$|By the 1950s, the bodies, {{which had}} always {{required}} {{a high level}} of maintenance, were deteriorating badly. As a result, 1953/54 saw 25 supply their <b>underframes</b> for use under P explosives vans (see below), which were then being constructed. Further P vans were built on the <b>underframes</b> of other wooden U vans, whose bodies had been condemned, during 1958/59.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first seven}} units cost £85,000 each. They were {{built on the}} 56 ft <b>underframes</b> built at Ashford Works and {{originally}} intended {{to be used for}} locomotive-hauled carriages. The units were designated 6S (six-car, short <b>underframes).</b> The bodies were built at Eastleigh Works and fitted out at Lancing Carriage Works. [...] The 6S units were 358 ft long overall.|$|R
25|$|Its origins {{as a horse}} {{tramroad}} and ascent {{through the}} narrow and winding Dulas valley meant it had exceptionally tight curves. Its original passenger carriages were simple 4-wheelers derived from urban horse-drawn tramway designs with end balconies; they rode poorly and were quickly rebuilt into longer bogie carriages by placing two of the original bodies end-to-end on a longer <b>underframe.</b>|$|E
25|$|Two {{carriages}} {{were used}} to form {{a replica of the}} Royal Train. Directly behind the loco was No. 229, a replica coach mounted on an ex-British Railways BG Full Brake <b>underframe</b> and containing waxwork figures of various members of the Royal Family. The second coach was the original Royal Day Saloon No. 9002 that was rescued for the exhibition from a cliff top in Aberporth, Wales.|$|E
25|$|The gas was {{stored in}} {{reservoirs}} slung under the <b>underframe</b> and these ruptured in the collision. Escaping gas was ignited by the coal-burning fires of the engines. The gas reservoirs {{had been filled}} before leaving Larbert, and this, {{and the lack of}} available water, meant that the fire was not extinguished until the morning of the next day, despite the best efforts of railway staff and the Carlisle fire brigade.|$|E
50|$|A {{small number}} of vans had been fitted with {{replacement}} <b>underframes</b> by the 1970s.|$|R
25|$|The Plymouth, Devonport and District steam trams had brown {{ends and}} <b>underframes</b> with white sides.|$|R
25|$|These {{coaches were}} built with light alloy bodies on steel <b>underframes</b> on Type B4 bogies.|$|R
25|$|Blackpool 31 {{was built}} in 1901 at the Midland Railway Carriage and Wagon Co. for Blackpool Tramway, {{originally}} as a four-wheel double-deck open topper, for use on the Marton route. In a trial of its intended Standard class tram designs, it was rebuilt in 1918, which saw the body being extended and remounted on a new <b>underframe</b> fitted with two English Electric 4′ wheelbase equal-wheel bogies, to the American McGuire pattern (the smaller end windows correspond to the length by which the body was extended), with BTH 265C 35hp motors and BTH 510 controllers.|$|E
25|$|All {{models have}} chassis and running gear, generator, {{traction}} motors and controls from GE, and Ingersoll Rand provided the diesel engine. The principle of operation {{was the same}} as modern locomotives, the diesel engine driving a main generator of 600volts DC with four axle-hung traction motors. In contrast to the ALCO boxcabs having a design with side doors and ladders the GE boxcabs have front doors and end platforms with steps. The <b>underframe</b> was cast iron. The radiator system was sitting {{on the roof of the}} locomotive. At each locomotive end a GE Model CD65 motor with a Sturtevant multivane fan was pressing air through the radiators.|$|E
25|$|The Mark 2 has a semi-integral construction, {{giving it}} more {{strength}} than a Mark 1 {{in the event}} of an accident, although a key driver of the changed construction method was to overcome the serious corrosion problem point in the Mark 1 at the base of the body, where it was attached to the <b>underframe.</b> Other changes of design, such as the window units, were for the same reason, which had become a serious problem in Mark 1 vehicle maintenance costs. Revised painting methods were also part of this, which coincided with the change of livery from maroon (dark green on the Southern) to the blue and grey that Mark 2 coaches wore for much of their lives (some of the earliest Mark 2 coaches had the old livery at first).|$|E
50|$|The Plymouth, Devonport and District steam trams had brown {{ends and}} <b>underframes</b> with white sides.|$|R
50|$|The {{eventual}} {{plan is to}} {{put together}} two complete 4- or 5-coach sets of LBSCR and LCDR carriages. It is acknowledged that this will take many years, but three carriages are already in service with another three under overhaul. Most of these carriages have been rescued as grounded bodies from within bungalows or on farms. <b>Underframes</b> {{for many of them}} are (or will be) provided by shortening SR passenger-rated van <b>underframes.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1992, {{the company}} started a {{rebuilding}} program for 12 coaches. On old <b>underframes,</b> {{brought to a}} unified length of 10.695 m over buffers, Ramseyer+Jenzer built a new steel body in the old compartment style. These coaches carry the numbers 41-52 (41-42 sit on the original <b>underframes</b> number 2 and 4, the others on <b>underframes</b> ex-WAB). Of the original stock numbers 6-8 (1894, 1924, 1929) with open compartments and 21-22 (1929, 1931) fully closed compartment coaches were kept and complemented with numbers 3 (open, 1893), 23 and 24 (closed, 1898, 1901) ex-WAB (last WAB numbers 3, 22, 24). This allows to build 10 consists of a locomotive with 2 coaches (see above, Operations). Original coaches 1 and 5 were scrapped in 1970 and 68, number 3 rebuilt as flat car (new number 91).|$|R
25|$|The N type {{carriages}} {{were the}} first cars to be built at Newport Workshops in over 20 years. Each carriage took over 20 weeks to construct, with a rolling production line to give one new carriage {{off the assembly line}} every fortnight. Weeks 1 to 7 involved the general structure - welding the shell and the <b>underframe</b> together and attaching the ends. Following that, the electrical fitout took four weeks, and the bogies were fitted after Week 11. A mineral fibre insulation was sprayed on internal surfaces between weeks 12-14, and then the final six weeks the internal fibreglass ceiling and wall sheets were fitted, along with carpet, seats, lighting, doors and other components, with a one-week trial at the end. The cost was roughly $500,000 per carriage. The total build time added to 16,500 man-hours per carriage, against 32,000 for the earlier Z type carriages. Additionally, the carriages are between five and eight tonnes heavier than comparable designs overseas, partially due to their being a compromise between regional and commuter type vehicles. On the other hand, they cost a mere $13,000 per seat, against $47,000 per seat for the XPT carriages being built for New South Wales Railways around the same time.|$|E
500|$|Bulleid {{designed}} a reduced capacity tender {{based upon the}} Merchant Navy version. [...] It could carry [...] water and [...] of coal on a six-wheel <b>underframe.</b> It retained the BFB wheels and streamlining panels, or [...] "raves", that gave {{the top of the}} tender a similar cross-sectional outline to carriages. As with the Merchant Navy class, the water tank was of welded sheet construction to save weight, and the tender was fitted with vacuum braking equipment of a clasp-type similar to that on the locomotive. Four train-brake vacuum reservoirs of cylindrical construction were grouped on the tank top, behind the coal space.|$|E
500|$|A serious {{incident}} occurred on 17 October 2004, when Wessex Trains [...] Pacer DMU 143613, forming the 20:06 2W63 service from [...] to [...] with 143621, caught fire between {{the site of}} the former station at [...] and Nailsea and Backwell. Fire services took two hours to get the blaze under control. None of the 23 passengers and crew were killed, but three were treated on-site for the effects of smoke inhalation. One carriage was completely burnt out, and the other was badly damaged, causing the train to be written off. The line through Nailsea was closed until 03:30 the following morning, when the train was hauled to St Philips Marsh Traction and Rolling Stock Maintenance Depot for examination. The unit was later taken to Crewe Works, where it was stored, then to Cardiff Canton TMD where it was scrapped. The Rail Safety and Standards Board issued a report into the incident, concluding that the fire was caused by electrical arcing between the live starter motor cable (which had damaged insulation) and the unit's <b>underframe,</b> causing accumulated oily residues to ignite.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{severity}} of the blaze, which reduced the two carriages to their <b>underframes,</b> only seven passengers were injured, with no fatalities.|$|R
50|$|The <b>underframes</b> {{of several}} PUL and PAN unit {{carriages}} were reused by the engineering department as long-welded rail carriers and crane runners.|$|R
50|$|The <b>underframes</b> {{were built}} of channel shaped cross-beams welded to flanged plate {{longitudinal}} girders. The corrugated steel floor was welded on top.|$|R
