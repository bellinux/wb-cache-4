5|$|Halo 2 is {{a shooter}} game, with players {{predominantly}} experiencing gameplay from a first-person perspective. Players <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> {{of human and}} alien weaponry and vehicles to progress through the game's levels. The player's health bar is not visible, but players are instead equipped with a damage-absorbing shield that regenerates when not taking fire.|$|E
5|$|The herd {{thrived on}} Llandudno's Great Orme; by 2001 {{they reached a}} {{population}} of 250, and {{were in danger of}} running out of food. Following complaints about goats wandering into people's gardens, the council rejected proposals for a cull, deciding to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of rehoming and birth control. RSPCA marksmen tranquilised nannies and inserted contraceptive progesterone implants to control the numbers of the genetically unique breed. By 2007, 85 goats had been relocated to areas including Kent, Yorkshire, the Brecon Beacons and Somerset, but further efforts were interrupted by an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{output of}} a SGD may be {{digitized}} and/or synthesized: digitized systems play directly recorded words or phrases while synthesized speech uses text-to-speech software that can carry less emotional information but permits {{the user to}} speak novel messages by typing new words.

5|$|In {{political}} and sociocultural studies, monarchies are normally associated with hereditary rule; most monarchs, in both {{historical and contemporary}} contexts, have been born and raised within a royal family. Succession has been defined {{using a variety of}} distinct formulae, such as proximity of blood, primogeniture, and agnatic seniority. Some monarchies, however, are not hereditary, and the ruler is instead determined through an elective process; a modern example is the throne of Malaysia. These systems defy the model concept of a monarchy, but are commonly considered as such because they retain certain associative characteristics. Many systems <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of hereditary and elective elements, where the election or nomination of a successor is restricted to members of a royal bloodline.|$|E
5|$|There exist data {{structures}} that may improve on binary search {{in some cases}} for both searching and other operations available for sorted arrays. For example, searches, approximate matches, and the operations available to sorted arrays can be performed more efficiently than binary search on specialized data structures such as van Emde Boas trees, fusion trees, tries, and bit arrays. However, while these operations can always be done at least efficiently on a sorted array regardless of the keys, such data structures are usually only faster because they exploit the properties of keys with a certain attribute (usually keys that are small integers), and thus will be time or space consuming for keys that lack that attribute. Some structures, such as Judy arrays, <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of approaches to mitigate this while retaining efficiency {{and the ability to}} perform approximate matching.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the game's animations were original, with very few borrowed from Grand Theft Auto III. For the characters, the team used motion capture and stop motion animation techniques; cutscenes use the former, while gameplay movements <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of both techniques. The team encountered difficulty in animating motorcycle animations, {{due in part to}} the variety of models. Pedestrian character models use skins in Vice City, allowing the artists to produce more realistic characters. There are 110 unique pedestrian models throughout the game world alongside roughly 50 story characters; each character is rendered using twice the amount of polygons and textures found in Grand Theft Auto III. This also impacted the character physics, improving gameplay aspects such as weapon-hit accuracy. Some character models and scenarios were inspired by films such as The Godfather (1972), and the game's presentation was inspired by action television shows of the 1980s. The interplay between Tommy Vercetti and Lance Vance was crafted to be similar to the relationship of Miami Vices Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs.|$|E

5|$|From {{her medical}} findings, Scully discovers that an alien virus {{is keeping the}} abductees alive long enough to cause a radical {{transformation}} to take place, {{similar to the one}} that Miles experienced. After Scully tells Doggett about the genetic transformation, he visits Absalom, who believes that the abductees are being resurrected into aliens who will eventually conquer Earth. Skinner—torn by his decision—decides to euthanize Mulder by pulling him off of life-support so that Krycek does not get his way. Doggett, however, catches Skinner attempting to remove the support. Skinner explains Krycek's demands, but Doggett argues that both options are unreasonable because either Scully's child will die, or Mulder will succumb to the virus. Doggett tries to locate Krycek {{in the parking lot of}} the FBI building, but Krycek nearly runs him down with a car, and purposely smashes the vaccine on the ground. Doggett tries to stop him but he escapes. Dejected, Doggett returns to the hospital and tells Skinner he was right not to trust Krycek. He finds Scully preparing Mulder for the now-destroyed vaccine; She tells Doggett that keeping Mulder on life-support was incubating the virus and hastening it along, and that Skinner effectively saved Mulder's life by pulling him off life-support, as it made his temperature drop rapidly without affecting his vital signs. She states that she will be able to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of antiviral drugs to kill the alien virus if they can get him and his temperature to stabilize.|$|E
5|$|Three {{construction}} {{options were}} evaluated during the project's Environmental Impact Study for {{the portion of}} the line between 11th Street and Hanover Square. One option known as the Shallow Chrystie Option would mainly use cut and cover, while the Deep Chrystie Street and Forsyth Options would <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of tunneling by Earth Pressure Balance Machines (EPBMs) and cut and cover. The Shallow Chrystie Option would have used the existing Confucius Plaza tunnel section between Canal and Division Streets, and like the plan from the 1970s, {{there would have been a}} cross-platform transfer to the existing Grand Street station, with the transfer expected to be heavily used. However, this option would require digging up Sara Delano Roosevelt Park to the east as Chrystie Street is not wide enough to fit four tracks. Under this option, a track connection would be built to allow trains from Second Avenue to run via the Manhattan Bridge north tracks to allow service to Brooklyn. The Forsyth Option would curve below the park to Forsyth Street and the station would be built under Forsyth Street, requiring a 200-foot transfer passageway that would be less convenient than the other options. The Deep Chrystie Option would have the Second Avenue Subway run deeper underground, running underneath the existing Grand Street station, with a mezzanine in between the two stations. In order to allow for sufficient room for stairways to transfer to the Second Avenue Line, the Grand Street station would be widened to have twenty foot wide platforms. No track connection would be built under this option, and the Confucius Plaza tunnel section would not be used for subway service, but it instead might be used for ancillary subway facilities. Currently, this is the preferred option.|$|E
