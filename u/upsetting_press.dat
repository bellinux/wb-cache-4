50|$|The Steep Ascent, {{so named}} after an ayah from the Holy Quran, was an online project of Man in Gutter (a.k.a. Yusuf Misdaq) written during Ramadan 2010. The ambitious concept {{was to write}} an entire book during the month itself, which Misdaq completed, one chapter and {{one day at a}} time until day 29 where the story ended. Concordant with the title, the writing - which is a blend of both {{morality}} and extreme-satire - plays on several 'bad-guy' stereotypes, and draws heavily from the Quran and traditional forms of oral-culture, Sufi storytelling. Mo, a young rising star in an unnamed corporate world, befriends Asad, a hot dog vendor. At present the novel has been taken offline and listed as 'private' amidst rumours that it has been picked up for publication. The Steep Ascent has been picked up by <b>UpSet</b> <b>Press</b> (an independent publisher from New York City) and is slated for a 2013 publication.|$|R
50|$|The {{company had}} four {{operating}} divisions: precision pressing division, steel division, fastener division, and engineering and forging division. The Precision pressing division made precision presswork for electrical, automotive, and textile industries stampings and strip would cores for electrical industry. The Steel division made electrically melted alloy steels, rolled and bright bars. The Fasteners division made bolts, nuts, screws and other fasteners. Engineering and forging division produces drop <b>upset</b> and <b>press</b> forgings.|$|R
50|$|The {{downside}} {{of the revenue}} is the traffic generated by the mall, particularly on major shopping days. Black Friday 2001 in particular was remembered for protracted snarling of not just the expressways leading to Woodbury Common but the local roads as well. Some motorists were trapped on the mall's internal roads for hours. Woodbury town officials and residents were extremely <b>upset</b> and <b>pressed</b> state police and Premium Outlets' parent company, Simon, for a solution for future years as they said the company had been unresponsive to such concerns in the past. The following Memorial Day, state troopers, Woodbury police and mall officials tested a new plan whereby they viewed the situation from a command center and made decisions jointly.|$|R
40|$|This work {{is devoted}} to the process of pipe ends <b>upsetting</b> in {{hydraulic}} <b>presses</b> from SMS Meer. The issues of the upsetting technology optimization in order {{to improve the quality of}} products and to reduce manufacturing costs are considered. The analyses of metal forming in the deformation zone and thermal conditions of the process were carried out, the equation to calculate the press forces was obtained and the ways to improve the economic indicators of the process were identified. As a result, it was allowed to optimize the pipe ends upsetting process and to ensure the production yield at the level of 99. 8 % as well as to master the production of drill pipes...|$|R
5000|$|This is {{confirmed}} by a booklet that the Village Charity published for its annual general meeting in 1994, which states: [...] "many volunteers of the charity get <b>upset</b> when the <b>press</b> call our weekend the 'Northern Pride'. It's not and never has been." [...] The purpose was solely {{to raise money for}} HIV and AIDS causes and in particular for the ward at Monsall Hospital where people received treatment. In 1991 the event was expanded to include a full programme of activities from Friday to Monday and it was named [...] "the Carnival of Fun Weekend". The jumble sale moved into Sackville Park. On the Monday night there was a substantial fireworks display that was funded by the North West Development Agency and it was announced that good-luck telegrams had been received from Diana Princess of Wales and other high-profile people.|$|R
40|$|The {{process for}} {{manufacturing}} wear-resisting bimetal rods is discussed. The {{purpose is to}} developed the judicious process for manufacturing bimetal rods which affords the wear resistance, the strong bonds between layers and the hold of dimentions to {{a high degree of}} accuracy. The variational method for solution of problems on the plasticity theory is used. A mathematical model for the change of a thickness of the clading (external) layer during the hollow billet <b>upsetting</b> in a <b>press</b> container which allow to analyze quantitatively the nonuniformity of the metal radial deformation under subpressing is obtained for the first time. A design technique of judicious dimensions and tolerances of initial centrifugal casting bimetal billets is developed.

40|$|This work investigates {{upsetting}} of the tri-metallic cylindrical billets both experimentally and analytically with {{a reduction}} ratio 30 %. Steel, brass, and copper {{are used for}} the outer and outmost rings and aluminum for the inner core. Two different models {{have been designed to}} show material flow and the cavity took place over the two interfaces during forming after this reduction ratio. Each model has an outmost ring material as steel. Model 1 has an outer ring between the outmost ring and the solid core material as copper and Model 2 has a material as brass. Solid core is aluminum for each model. Billets were <b>upset</b> in <b>press</b> machine by using parallel flat dies. Upsetting load was recorded and compared for models and single billets. To extend the tests and compare with experimental procedure to a wider range of inner core and outer ring geometries, finite element model was performed. ABAQUS software was used for the simulations. The aim is to show how contact between outmost ring, outer ring and the inner core are carried on throughout the upsetting process. Results have shown that, with changing in height, between outmost ring, outer ring and inner core, the Model 1 and Model 2 had very good interaction, and the contact surfaces of models had various interface behaviour. It is also observed that tri-metallic materials have lower weight but better mechanical properties than single materials. This can give an idea for using and producing these new materials for different purposes...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: People {{bereaved}} by suicide {{are often}} {{reported to be}} distressed by media reporting. Current media guidelines for reporting suicide focus especially on prevention of copycat behaviour. AIMS: To explore bereaved individuals' experiences of media reporting after suicide and to examine their priorities in relation to media guidelines. METHOD: In-depth interviews with 40 people bereaved by suicide, with qualitative analysis. Review of four guidelines. RESULTS: There is a difference of emphasis between guidance for the press that aims to prevent copycat suicides (especially avoidance of details such as method used) and the perspectives of bereaved people (who prioritise sympathetic and accurate reporting, sometimes including details of the death and images {{of the person who}} died). We found that bereaved relatives were sometimes keen to talk to the press. Those who were <b>upset</b> by the <b>press</b> focused on careless reporting, misquoting and speculation that gave an inaccurate impression of the death. CONCLUSIONS: The Leveson Inquiry has drawn attention to the damage that can be caused by irresponsible journalism. Guidelines written to prevent 'copycat' suicides are important, but so are the needs of bereaved relatives. Because accuracy matters greatly to the bereaved, families should be able to work with an intermediary such as a police press officer to prepare a statement for the press to minimise the risk of misrepresentation...|$|R
5000|$|Heart to Heart was {{released}} {{just weeks after}} Haggard and Williams had divorced {{after five years of}} marriage. Williams, who had replaced Bonnie Owens in Haggard's life both professionally and personally in 1974, grew to become increasingly frustrated with her supporting role in the Strangers, having harbored musical aspirations of her own; the Missouri native had been a well respected musician and singer in her own right (she had played bass in Loretta Lynn's first touring band) and wrote two #1 hits for Haggard: the telling [...] "You Take Me For Granted" [...] in 1982 and [...] "Someday When Things Are Good" [...] in 1983. According to the liner notes for the 1994 retrospective Down Every Road written by music journalist Daniel Cooper, she wrote the former while sitting on the bus in Ohio, then played it for Merle in front of several of his friends after Merle had reduced her to tears during a duet session they were recording. [...] "He got big old tears in his eyes," [...] Cooper quotes Leona, [...] "and he said, 'Is that how you feel? And I said, 'Yes, it is.'" [...] As Haggard wrote in his 1981 autobiography Sing Me Back Home, [...] "I'd reached the point in my career where I felt in charge of my music...When Leona tried to make a suggestion, I resented it. She resented my resentment. So it went. She kept saying she felt like an outsider...I couldn't understand why she got so <b>upset</b> by the <b>press</b> leaning toward good ol' Bonnie and the snide remarks about Leona coming in and breaking up my 'happy home.'" [...] In the documentary Learning to Live With Myself, fellow country star Tanya Tucker speculates that a professional competition came between the couple, remembering that Merle promised [...] "after Leona he would never, ever marry another woman who wanted to be in show business." [...] In his 2013 Haggard book The Running Kind, David Cantwell observes that Haggard [...] "seems alternately to have supported and undermined her efforts" [...] at establishing a solo career, citing their finally recording together on Mercury causing the label to lose interest in her forthcoming solo LP altogether. Their divorce served as a license to party for Haggard, who spent much of the next decade becoming mired in alcohol and drug problems.|$|R
5000|$|Haggard {{had loved}} Lefty Frizzell's [...] "That's the Way Love Goes" [...] since he {{first heard the}} song took a stab at {{recording}} it {{towards the end of}} his tenure with Capitol Records in the mid-seventies with unsatisfactory results. That version, which {{can be found on the}} box set Hag: The Studio Recordings 1969-1976, is more lighthearted and whimsical than the one Haggard would record in 1983, which possesses a delicate melancholy that somehow becomes uplifting mainly because of Haggard's masterful delivery of the words. The song topped the Billboard country singles chart, as did [...] "Someday When Things Are Good," [...] a song co-authored by Haggard and his wife Leona Williams. It also proved to be prophetic, as the couple would divorce that year. Williams had also written Haggard's recent hit [...] "You Take Me For Granted," [...] but Williams, who replaced Haggard's previous wife Bonnie Owens in the Strangers, had creative aspirations of her own that were not always appreciated by her husband. As Haggard wrote in his 1981 autobiography Sing Me Back Home, [...] "I'd reached the point in my career where I felt in charge of my music...When Leona tried to make a suggestion, I resented it. She resented my resentment. So it went. She kept saying she felt like an outsider...I couldn't understand why she got so <b>upset</b> by the <b>press</b> leaning toward good ol' Bonnie and the snide remarks about Leona coming in and breaking up my 'happy home.'" [...] The divorce would instigate a personal landslide for Haggard, who would spend the rest of the decade losing himself in a fog of alcohol and drugs, although initially it did not prevent him from scoring #1 hits. In fact, That's The Way Love Goes was his third hit LP for Epic in two years, not counting two separate duet albums with George Jones and Willie Nelson. While discussing his own song [...] "Bad Boy" [...] in the liner notes to Great Days: The John Prine Anthology, John Prine admitted, [...] "Around that time, I fell under the spell of Merle Haggard's songwriting. There was a period there when he just seemed to be churning out some really great stuff. He was bringing out great albums every six or eight months, and I considered 'Bad Boy' sort of in the vein of what he was doing." ...|$|R
