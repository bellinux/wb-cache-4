40|$|Emission {{factors for}} PCDD/PCDF {{determined}} from open combustion {{are used to}} estimate national emission budgets; therefore, {{it is important to}} have confidence in their accuracy. It has been suspected that artefacts may form due to the presence of hot metal surfaces of sampling equipment, thus skewing emission factors. In this study, emissions of PCDD/PCDF from open burning of forest biomass over a brick hearth were sampled. Five experiments were carried out using a portable sampler. Experiments were designed where the key variable, sample <b>hood</b> and inlet <b>temperatures</b> were manipulated. Other variables such as fuel origin, type and density were consistent. The measured concentration of PCDD/PCDF in the smoke samples ranged from 0. 01 mu g TEQ (t fuel) (- 1) at the lowest maximum <b>hood</b> <b>temperature</b> (185 degrees C) to 15 mu g TEQ (t fuel) (- 1) at the highest maximum <b>hood</b> <b>temperature</b> (598 degrees C). when <b>hood</b> inlet <b>temperatures</b> exceeded 400 degrees C emission factors were significantly elevated and this is attributed to the formation of artefacts that can cause the over estimation of emission factors. The increase in <b>hood</b> <b>temperature</b> also resulted in a change in the PCDD/PCDF congener and homologue profile of the emissions. For example at the lowest temperature (Fire 1) the PCDD/PCDF ratio measured was 50 : 1, whereas at the highest temperature (Fire 5) this ratio was about 0. 53 : 1. When the sampler <b>hood</b> and inlet <b>temperatures</b> were kept in the normal operating range o...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{flow and}} leakage {{characteristics}} of the air-curtain fume <b>hood</b> <b>under</b> high <b>temperature</b> operation (between 100 °C and 250 °C) were studied. Laser-assisted flow visualization technique was used to reveal the hot plume movements in the cabinet and the critical conditions for the hoodtop leakage. The sulfur hexafluoride tracer-gas concentration test method {{was employed to examine}} the containment spillages from the sash opening and the hood top. It was found that the primary parameters dominating the behavior of the flow field and hood performance are the sash height and the suction velocity as an air-curtain hood is operated at high temperatures. At large sash height and low suction velocity, the air curtain broke down and accompanied with three-dimensional flow in the cabinet. Since the suction velocity was low and the sash opening was large, the makeup air drawn down from the hood top became insufficient to counter act the rising hot plume. Under this situation, containment leakage from the sash opening and the hood top was observed. At small sash opening and high suction velocity, the air curtain presented robust characteristics and the makeup air flow from the hood top was sufficiently large. Therefore the containment leakages from the sash opening and the hood top were not observed. According to the results of experiments, quantitative operation sash height and suction velocity corresponding to the operation temperatures were suggested...|$|R

40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{is today}} an {{important}} tool in the design process of fuel and energy efficient vehicles. <b>Under</b> <b>hood</b> Thermal Management (UTM) {{is one of the}} design fields which CFD has proven itself to be a very competitive design tool over other available tools and techniques. To simulate the <b>under</b> <b>hood</b> environment {{it is very important to}} predict cooling airflow accurately, and for this, it is very important to model all components in the cooling airflow path accurately. Important components are the heat exchangers, fan, grille-, and engine blockage. This paper has focused on CFD modeling of the fan using the most common fan model of the industry; Multiple Reference Frame (MRF). Several different aspects of this modeling strategy are examined that is of high importance to the CFD-engineer working with fan modeling. The finding of this paper is that the MRF model is highly capable of simulating fan airflow however some sensitivity are noted and documented. The model is very sensitive towards end-user working procedure. The CFD engineer working with this methodology in the <b>under</b> <b>hood</b> should be made aware of that the choice of reference frames and frozen position of the blade can have a very big impact on the simulated result...|$|R
