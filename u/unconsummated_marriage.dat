2500|$|By 1892, Polignac, aged 57, inept {{with money}} and impoverished through {{investments}} {{in a series of}} get-rich-quick schemes, was destitute; his nephews helped him with loans but noted that desperate action was needed. The solution that they suggested was marriage to a woman of appropriate means. Polignac discussed the matter with Montesquiou, who in turn discussed it with his cousin Élisabeth Greffulhe, and out of these conversations the name of Winnaretta Singer, daughter of Isaac Singer, the sewing machine tycoon, arose. Her marriage to Prince Louis de Scey-Montbéliard had lately been annulled. [...] Her social status could be improved by marrying a prince, even a poor one. And the arrangement would have other benefits: Polignac's homosexuality would not be an issue as Winnaretta was a lesbian She was intimately interested in music, however, something the two did have in common. Polignac asked the comtesse Greffulhe to sound out Madame Singer on the subject of a mariage blanc (<b>unconsummated</b> <b>marriage)</b> in which each partner would have their own bed but would share artistic interests. [...] Montesquiou, who collaborated with Winnaretta on some artistic projects, asked her to speak with Madame Greffulhe, and there the arguments were reviewed; her social position, compromised by divorce, would be improved by an alliance with {{one of the oldest and}} most distinguished aristocratic families in France; with the thirty-one year age difference, and the predilections of the bride and groom, Winnaretta would be free to lead her personal life as she wished, with no sexual demands from Edmond.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} common reproductive challenges among Asian Indian (AI) {{women living}} in Silicon Valley as perceived by healthcare providers (HCP). Design: A 71 -item investigator-developed survey Setting: The survey was available on-line to all HCPs in California Santa Clara county, 75 % of respondents were affiliated with El Camino Hospital Mountain View. Participants: Convenience sample of 78 respondents: 34 % mother-baby nurses, 24 % labor-delivery nurses, 21 % OB/GYNs, 7 % CNMs, 14 % other HCP; 89 % female; 55 % Caucasian, 24 % Asian. Methods: Likert-type scales comparing prevalence of certain reproductive challenges among AI women and women from other race-ethnic groups and openended questions regarding HCPs’ experience caring for AI women. Results: AI women seeking reproductive services in Silicon Valley {{are more likely than}} women from other race ethnic groups to experience <b>unconsummated</b> <b>marriages,</b> vaginismus, and difficulty tolerating pelvic exams. They {{are also more likely to}} lack of knowledge about sex and reproduction. AI women exhibited increased anxiety around pregnancy, birth, breastfeeding, newborn care, as well as reluctance to enroll in classes or prepare a birth plan. Nurses found clients’ lack of understanding of the training and function of the nurses in the United States, as well as AI patients’ families’ large role decisionmaking, to be obstacles to establishing therapeutic relationship with AI patients. Conclusion: HCPs need to be aware of prevalence of vaginismus in AI women. Culturally competent prenatal classes addressing identified reproductive challenges of AI women need to be developed and expectant parents and family members need to be encouraged to participate. HCPs need to be educated on culturally competent care to AI patients...|$|R

50|$|The brotherhood found {{support from}} the critic John Ruskin, who praised its devotion to nature and {{rejection}} of conventional methods of composition. The Pre-Raphaelites were influenced by Ruskin's theories. He wrote to The Times defending their work and subsequently met them. Initially, he favoured Millais, who travelled to Scotland {{in the summer of}} 1853 with Ruskin and Ruskin's wife, Euphemia Chalmers Ruskin, née Gray (now best known as Effie Gray). The main object of the journey was to paint Ruskin's portrait. Effie became increasingly attached to Millais, creating a crisis. In subsequent annulment proceedings, Ruskin himself made a statement to his lawyer to the effect that his <b>marriage</b> had been <b>unconsummated.</b> The <b>marriage</b> was annulled on grounds of non-consummation, leaving Effie free to marry Millais, but causing a public scandal. Millais began {{to move away from the}} Pre-Raphaelite style after his marriage, and Ruskin ultimately attacked his later works. Ruskin continued to support Hunt and Rossetti and provided funds to encourage the art of Rossetti's wife Elizabeth Siddal.|$|R

50|$|As Edward VI became gravely ill, his council became seriously worried. Having {{taken the}} country in a more overtly Protestant direction, they were now faced with the {{prospect}} of a staunchly Catholic Queen Mary. Elisabeth realised that if Henry’s daughter ascended the throne, their whole lifestyle, and the validity of their marriage, would be in tatters. It was Elisabeth who came up with the idea that Jane Grey, the granddaughter of Henry’s sister Mary, would make a more acceptable queen than Henry’s eldest daughter. (This reference is simply to a letter written to William Cecil, in the reign of Elizabeth, in which Elizabeth Parr is described as a prime mover in the marriage of John Dudley's son Guildford to Lady Jane Grey. The additional information, alleging Elisabeth's involvement to further Lady Jane Grey's claim to the throne, is entirely unsubstantiated by any reputable account of the events.) The devoutly Protestant Jane was quickly married to the Duke of Northumberland’s son and her sister Catherine was married to Northampton’s nephew and heir, Henry Herbert; the latter <b>marriage</b> was probably <b>unconsummated</b> and the <b>marriage</b> was annulled soon after. Elisabeth hoped that the Council could then keep control of the country.|$|R

After learning of a Tyrell plot to claim Winterfell through marriage to Sansa, Tywin forces Tyrion to marry her instead. Sympathetic to Sansa's situation, Tyrion leaves their <b>marriage</b> <b>unconsummated,</b> despite his father's orders to conceive a child with her as soon as possible. At the celebration of his wedding to Margaery Tyrell, Joffrey is poisoned. Cersei promptly accuses Tyrion, who is arrested. His previous good deeds forgotten, Tyrion is put on trial as Cersei manipulates the proceedings to ensure a guilty verdict. He is heartbroken to find that even Shae has turned against him. In his grief, Tyrion demands a trial by combat, to which Cersei responds by naming the virtually unbeatable Gregor Clegane as her champion. Oberyn Martell agrees to fight for Tyrion but dies in the attempt. Pronounced guilty, Tyrion is taken to the dungeon to await his execution. Jaime frees him with the help of Varys, eventually confessing his complicity in Tywin's ruin of Tyrion's first wife Tysha. Furious, Tyrion swears revenge on his family for a lifetime of cruelty and lies to Jaime that he did murder Joffrey. Before escaping the palace, Tyrion goes to confront his father, and finds Shae in Tywin's bed. After strangling her in a rage, Tyrion murders Tywin as well when he speaks ill of Tysha, and flees Westeros.|$|R
50|$|Once married, the {{importance}} of fidelity directly related to a woman’s honor and her acknowledgment of male control of her sexuality. A man was supposed to transform his wife from a virgin to a woman by consummating the marriage, ideally with a pregnancy.

50|$|Pauline {{had also}} been very {{friendly}} with Ruskin's wife Effie, but took Ruskin's side when their marriage was annulled in 1854 and subsequently shunned Effie's attempts to maintain contact with her. The previous summer the Ruskins had spent a protracted artistic holiday in the Scottish Highlands with the Pre-Raphaelite painter John Millais and his brother William. En route to Scotland the party stayed with the Trevelyans at Wallington. Pauline noticed that Ruskin and Effie (whose <b>unconsummated</b> <b>marriage</b> was under great strain) {{spent most of their}} time apart, but also seems to have been put out by Effie's flirtatious behaviour with John Millais and their lengthy absences together from the house. Even so, she was complimentary about Effie's appearance at an evening party at which she wore flowers in her hair, a stylistic trait that subsequently irritated Ruskin, came to the disapproving notice of Florence Nightingale, and inspired a painting by Millais ("Effie with Foxgloves in her Hair", 1853), whom Effie married in 1855.|$|E

Ahmet meets Rüya, Yasemin's daughter, and wishes she were his own daughter. Ahmet tries to reconcile with Yasemin when he discovers how both families intervened to split them up but Yasemin refuses. He suggests she runs away with him but she cannot betray Necdet after all he has done for her. So Ahmet carries on alone, later becoming engaged to Ayla and working as a teacher in the same university in which Yasemin is teaching Arts. At the end of the first season Ahmet discovers that he is the father of Yasemin's daughter Rüya; he feels betrayed and disappointed by Yasemin, and sues Yasemin and Necdet to get custody of his daughter. During the trial, many truths are discovered which attenuate Ahmet's anger.|$|E
5000|$|In 1923, he sired a {{daughter}}, Catherine, by Elisabeth van Rysselberghe, a {{woman who}} was much younger than he. He had known her for a long time, as she was the daughter of his closest female friend, Maria Monnom, the wife of his friend the Belgian neo-impressionist painter Théo van Rysselberghe. This caused the only crisis in the long-standing relationship between Allégret and Gide and damaged the relation with van Rysselberghe. This was possibly Gide's only sexual liaison with a woman, and it was brief in the extreme. Catherine became his only descendant by blood. He liked to call Elisabeth [...] "La Dame Blanche" [...] ("The White Lady"). Elisabeth eventually left her husband to move to Paris and manage the practical aspects of Gide's life (they had adjoining apartments built for each on the rue Vavin). She worshiped him, but evidently they no longer had a sexual relationship. Gide's legal wife, Madeleine, died in 1938.

50|$|The new Duke and Duchess of Bourbon then {{proceeded}} to add to these domains, adding Bourbon-Lancy in December 1488, and trading l'Isle-en-Jordain with the Armagnacs in June 1489 for Carlades and Murat.

On 10 May 1491, the pair finally acquired an heir of their own, a daughter, Suzanne (Anne had an earlier pregnancy in 1476, but about this existed contradictory accounts: some say the baby was miscarried or been stillborn, but others reported that a living son was born, Charles, styled Count of Clermont in 1488 as was customary for the heir of the Duchy of Bourbon, who died aged 22 in 1498 and was buried in the Abbey of Souvigny, Auvergne).By 1491, the Bourbon influence over the crown was waning; Charles VIII was an adult now, unwilling to accept tutelage from his family.

Both continued to be major figures in the court for the rest of Charles VIII's reign, but restricted in power.

Holbein applied this clean, craftsmanlike technique both to miniature portraits, {{such as that}} of Jane Small, and to grand portraits, {{such as that of}} Christina of Denmark. Holbein travelled with Philip Hoby to Brussels and sketched Christina in 1538 for the king, who was appraising the young widow as a prospective bride. John Hutton, the English ambassador in Brussels, reported another artist's drawing of Christina as [...] "sloberid" [...] (slobbered) compared to Holbein's. In Wilson's view, Holbein's subsequent oil portrait is [...] "the loveliest painting of a woman that he ever executed, {{which is to say that}} it is one of the finest female portraits ever painted". The same year, Holbein, again escorted by the diplomat Hoby, went to France to paint Louise of Guise and Anne of Lorraine for Henry VIII. Neither portrait of these cousins has survived. Holbein found time to visit Basel, where he was fêted by the authorities and granted a pension. On the way back to England, he apprenticed his son Philipp to the Basel-born goldsmith Jacob David in Paris.Holbein painted Anne of Cleves, posing her square-on and in elaborate finery.

As Eddie Duggan observes, 'Woolrich enrolled at New York's Columbia University in 1921 {{where he spent}} a relatively undistinguished year until he was taken ill and was laid up for some weeks. It was during this illness (a Rear-Window-like confinement involving a gangrenous foot, according to one version of the story) that Woolrich started writing, producing Cover Charge, {{which was published in}} 1926. [...] Cover Charge was one of his Jazz Age novels inspired by the work of F. Scott Fitzgerald. A second novel, Children of the Ritz, won Woolrich a college prize the following year and led to him working as screenwriter in Hollywood for First National Pictures. While in Hollywood, Woolrich explored his sexuality, apparently engaging in what Frances M. Nevins Jr. describes as [...] "promiscuous and clandestine homosexual activity" [...] and by marrying Violet Virginia Blackton, the 21-year-old daughter of J. Stuart Blackton {{one of the founders of}} the Vitagraph studio. Failing in both his attempt at marriage and at establishing a career as a screenwriter (the <b>unconsummated</b> <b>marriage</b> was annulled in 1933; Woolrich garnered no screen credits), Woolrich sought to resume his life as a novelist: [...] Although Woolrich had published six 'jazz-age'novels, concerned with the party-antics and romances of the beautiful young things on the fringes of American society, between 1926 and 1932, he was unable to establish himself as a serious writer. Perhaps because the 'jazz-age' novel was dead in the water by the 1930s when the depression had begun to take hold, Woolrich was unable to find a publisher for his seventh novel, I Love You, Paris, so he literally threw away the typescript, dumped it in a dustbin, and re-invented himself as a pulp writer.|$|E
