At this moment, in most systems, there are no requirements defined for short-circuit behavior of such generators connected to the medium voltage grid. However in the future this situation will not be acceptable anymore, since with the present protection settings of DG a fault in the transmission grid may lead to disconnection of a large amount of DG over a large geographical area. This paper focuses on CHP-plants connected to the MV-grid. New settings for the <b>under-voltage</b> <b>protection</b> will be proposed. These settings will be based on voltage dip profiles and the fault ride through capability of the CHP-plants. With the aid of dynamic simulations it is shown that the new settings of the <b>under-voltage</b> <b>protection</b> can lead to a significant improvement of the availability performance without loosing the stability of the generators...|$|E

40|$|In {{the near}} future a {{significant}} amount of the consumed electrical energy will be generated by distributed generation (DG). Because of the small size these units are normally connected to the local distribution grid [1]. Connection of DG changes the operation of the distribution grid. In order to minimize the effect of DG during grid disturbances some standards oblige immediate disconnection of DG-units. With an increasing number of DG-units this strategy can lead to a disconnection of a large amount of DG-units and jeopardize the security of supply. To prevent large unbalances between generation and load because of disconnection of DG-units some grid operators have defined fault-ride-through requirements. These fault-ride-through requirements are especially applied for large wind parks which are connected to the transmission grid. In this paper the effect of disturbances in the transmission grid on the fault-ride-through behaviour of medium voltage connected DG-units is discussed. The examined grid is an existing transmission and distribution grid. To the distribution grid a large amount of combined heat and power (CHP) plants are connected.

40|$|There {{are many}} stator ground faults {{protection}} schemes {{available in the}} industry. These schemes relatively perform well in detecting the faults in the stator winding. The protection of the neutral point vicinity is the challenge because of the low voltage induced in that area. The 100 % stator protection concept {{has been around for}} a long time. However, these schemes sometimes have limitations. The fact that stator ground fault detection in generators depends on many factors like the generator design, the generator loading, and the equivalent capacitance of the generator?s windings and the apparatus connected to it, occasionally caused these schemes to fail to detect the winding faults near the neutral or to miss-operate during normal system disturbance. In this dissertation, an electromagnetic analysis of the synchronous generators stator winding ground faults is presented. A mathematical model for the synchronous generator under stator winding fault is being derived. In addition, a study is conducted using 2 D FEA simulation and verified using experimental testing on the third harmonic ratio <b>under-voltage</b> <b>protection</b> scheme. Another study focuses on finding a unique signature for the stator ground fault using wavelet transform. This analysis is an attempt to understand this phenomenon from the machine design point of view by looking at the generator terminal and neutral voltages. The analysis presented in this dissertation shows that the protection schemes perform positively in detecting stator ground fault. However, it does not show reliable performance under system disturbances. On the other hand, the wavelet method shows better performance and it reflects robustness against these disturbances...|$|E
40|$|As {{the number}} of wind {{generation}} facilities in the utility system is fast increasing, many issues associated with their integration into the power system are beginning to emerge. Of the various issues, this dissertation deals {{with the development of}} new concepts and computational methods to handle the transmission issues and voltage issues caused by large-scale integration of wind turbines. This dissertation also formulates a probabilistic framework for the steady-state security assessment of wind power incorporating the forecast uncertainty and correlation. Transmission issues are mainly related to the overloading of transmission lines, when all the wind power generated cannot be delivered in full due to prior outage conditions. To deal with this problem, a method to curtail the wind turbine outputs through Energy Management System facilities in the on-line operational environment is proposed. The proposed method, which is based on linear optimization, sends the calculated control signals via the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system to wind farm controllers. The necessary ramping of the wind farm outputs is implemented either by the appropriate blade pitch angle control at the turbine level or by switching a certain number of turbines. The curtailment strategy is tested with an equivalent system model of MidAmerican Energy Company. The results show that the line overload in high wind areas can be alleviated by controlling the outputs of the wind farms step-by-step over an allowable period of time. A low voltage event during a system fault can cause a large number of wind turbines to trip, depending on voltages at the wind turbine terminals during the fault and the <b>under-voltage</b> <b>protection</b> setting of wind turbines. As a result, an N- 1 contingency may evolve into an N-(K+ 1) contingency, where K is {{the number of}} wind farms tripped due to low voltage conditions. Losing a large amount of wind power following a line contingency might lead to system instabilities. It is important for the system operator to be aware of such limiting events during system operation and be prepared to take proper control actions. This can be achieved by incorporating the wind farm tripping status for each contingency as part of the static security assessment. A methodology to calculate voltages at the wind farm buses during a worst case line fault is proposed, which, along with the protection settings of wind turbines, can be used to determine the tripping of wind farms. The proposed algorithm is implemented in MATLAB and tested with MidAmerican Energy reduced network. The result shows that a large amount of wind capacity can be tripped due to a fault in the lines. A probabilistic framework to handle the uncertainty in day-ahead forecast error in order to correctly assess the steady-state security of the power system is presented. Stochastic simulations are conducted by means of Latin Hypercube sampling along with the consideration of correlations. The correlation is calculated from the historical distribution of wind power forecast errors. The results from the deterministic simulation based on point forecast and the stochastic simulation show that security assessment based solely on deterministic simulations can lead to incorrect assessment of system security. With stochastic simulations, each outcome can be assigned a probability and the decision regarding control actions can be made based on the associated probability...|$|E
40|$|The LM 2647 is an {{adjustable}} 200 - 500 kHz dual channel voltage-mode controlled high-speed synchronous buck regulator controller ideally suited for battery powered {{applications such as}} laptop and notebook computers.

40|$|Thesis {{presented}} in ful lment {{of the requirements}} for the degree of Magister Technologiae in Electrical Engineering at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2013 The power system is essentially {{one of the most}} critical subsystems to any satellite, without some form of power system a satellite would simply cease to function. The research within these pages investigates the areas pertaining to satellite power systems with the main focus towards the CubeSat platform. The end objective of this research was the development of a reliable analogue based switch-mode power system for a CubeSat. The research began with an investigation into the CubeSat platform, the space environment and a basic overview of a satellite and its systems. The research then focussed on satellite power systems, focussing primarily on satellite power system topologies and switch-mode power systems. Various components and concepts surrounding the satellite power system were investigate and included the photovoltaic (PV) solar cell, batteries, satellite power system topologies, protection concepts and typical CubeSat power systems. The nal part of the literature review included research into typical CubeSat power systems. The space environment complicates the design of satellite systems. The developed electrical power system harnessed electrical power from a PV solar panel by means of a fractional opencircuit voltage (FOCV) based maximum power point tracker (MPPT) with the use of a SEPIC DC-DC converter. The use of a SEPIC DC-DC converter allowed the system to operate at a greater e ciency than could be expected from linear designs. The requirement for an e cient system was important as the heat generated by the power system could bring rise to dissipation issues, resulting in over-heating of various components. The design took into account component sizing, as larger components would be more prone to damage during the high accelerations and vibrations associated with being launched into space. The use of a MPPT allowed the power system to better utilise the available PV solar panel power, by maintaining the PV solar panel near its optimum operating voltage. The design slid between MPPT and voltage regulation to harness as much power as possible while not over-charging the Lithium polymer battery. The power system consisted of battery <b>under-voltage</b> <b>protection</b> as well as over-current protection for the attached payloads and satellite subsystems. The SEPIC DC-DC converter was selected over other SMPS topologies, as this topology could be used in a 1 U and 3 U CubeSat with a wide variety of PV solar panel cell con gurations. The bene ts of this SMPS topology are due to the SEPIC DC-DC converter's ability to produce an output voltage greater than, less than or equal to the input voltage (National Semiconductor, 2008; Texas Instruments, 2008 a). This, along with the operation of the FOCV based MPPT, allowed the power system to be very exible. The designed FOCV based MPPT could be pre-set to di ering PV solar cell technologies due to the adjustable ratio between the maximum power point voltage, Vmpp, and the open-circuit voltage, Voc of the PV solar panel. It was decided not to select a Buck or Boost DC-DC converter based power system as this would limit the exibility of the system. Additionally, the SEPIC DC-DC converter brings with it the ability to isolate the input and output voltage upon shut down. This isolation is due to the SEPIC DC-DC converter's coupling capacitor and this topologies operation as described by National Semiconductor (2008) and Texas Instruments (2008 a). The prototype was versatile allowing a wide variety of PV solar cell technologies to be used. The wide operating voltage of the prototype allowed the design to be connected to a series or parallel combination of solar cells with an operating voltage of 3 V to 20 V. The power handling capability of the prototype per solar panel channel allows the design to be applied to a 1 U or 3 U CubeSat given that the channel did not exceed 10 W. All components of the prototype operated without fault, e ectively charging the Li-poly battery safely while protecting payloads and subsystems. The SEPIC DC-DC converter utilised by the MPPT achieved an e ciency of 71 % under full load and with an input voltage of 10 V...|$|E
