5|$|In the epilogue, {{several of}} the staff share {{thoughts}} about Michael in private interviews. The episode finishes with a scene that takes place the next morning, with the entire staff waiting {{in the conference room}} for Michael to arrive for his farewell party, <b>unaware</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>already</b> left, with the exception of Jim and Pam. When DeAngelo deduces Michael is not coming, he begins tearing pieces off Michael's farewell cake (a major subplot point of the episode) and throwing them in the trash, in a bizarre public internal struggle over his dieting. The rest of the staff, particularly Jim and Dwight, watch their new boss's outburst with concern.|$|E

During this time Sam Philips relates to the audience how he first discovered the boy, and a brief, few line scene of that moment occurs between Philips and the musician, followed by Sam Phillips asking the boy to play something for him, which is the next verse of the song, and everyone unfreezes.|$|E

[...] On the same day Angela Rippon and Anna Ford came out publicly to support Peter Jay, <b>unaware</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> left. A month later both Rippon and Ford were sacked. A few months later, Anna Ford encountered Jonathan Aitken at a party in Chelsea; in a parting shot over the terms of her dismissal, Ford threw her glass of wine in the face of Aitken, saying of her action: [...] "It was the only form of self-defence left to a woman when she has been so monstrously treated". A couple of days later both Rippon and Ford started procedures to sue TV-am, by October, the case was dropped after reaching an out of court settlement. A month later, cousin Timothy Aitken became {{chief executive of the}} station due to the IBA rules regarding MPs operating a television station.

500|$|On {{the eve of}} Waller's execution, Eleanor Roosevelt {{appealed to}} her husband, President Franklin D. Roosevelt; Franklin agreed, sending a private letter to Darden urging that the {{sentence}} be commuted to life imprisonment, signing it, [...] "an old friend who {{just happens to be}} president". Darden held a ten-hour clemency hearing and, after hearing arguments from both sides, decided to proceed with the execution. Pauli Murray, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters' A. Philip Randolph, and the NAACP's Walter White traveled to Washington in an attempt to lobby the president personally, <b>unaware</b> that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> secretly appealed on their behalf. The president's apparent refusal to act damaged his relationship with civil rights leaders; Murray, in an open letter on behalf of the movement, called it a [...] "stab in the back".

That day, while he was leaving the sets, Ray called him over and introduced him to actor Chhabi Biswas as [...] "..This is Soumitra Chattopadhyay; he's playing Apu in my next film Apur Sansar" [...] leaving him much surprised. Despite being selected, as a debutant actor, Chatterjee was nevertheless unsure for his career choice and especially his looks, as he didn't consider himself photogenic. However, on 9 August 1958, when the first shot of the film was given an okay in one take, <b>he</b> realized <b>he</b> <b>had</b> found his vocation. Thus Soumitra's film debut came in 1959 in Satyajit Ray's The World of Apu (Apur Sansar). In fact Ray believed with a beard Chatterjee looked like young poet laureate Tagore.|$|R
5000|$|Ray wanted fresh faces {{again for}} the film like other two films in the Apu Trilogy and thus he started auditioning.

Though Ray thought <b>he</b> <b>had</b> the right look, he found him too old for the role. Ray remembered him and offered the role of adult Apu two years later. [...] Chatterjee was still <b>unaware</b> that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> been selected for the title role. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> gone on the sets of Ray's fourth film, Jalsaghar, to watch the shoot. That day, while he was leaving the sets, Ray called him over and introduced him to actor Chhabi Biswas, saying, [...] "This is Soumitra Chattopadhyay; he's playing Apu in my next film Apur Sansar", leaving him surprised. Ray however had a tough time finding an actress for the female lead Aparna. He even placed an ad was placed in a local daily asking for photographs from girls between ages of 15 and 17. There were over a thousand responses to the ad, but Ray found none of them worth auditioning. This was when Ray came to know of a young girl, Sharmila Tagore, who had recently performed at a dance recital at Children's Little Theatre (CLT) in Kolkata. She is related to poet Rabindranath Tagore, and subsequently auditioned and was selected.|$|R
