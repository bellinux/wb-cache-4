25|$|The {{layout of}} ancient Malaka is unknown, but its {{location}} {{on a hill}} {{at the foot of}} Mount Gibralfaro suggests it was a more dense and irregular <b>urban</b> <b>cluster</b> than neighbouring Cerro del Villar, that is, Mainake. Traces of ancient landings there, as of a port, correspond with the description in the Periplous. The ruins mentioned by Strabo were still visible in the 1st century BC, and could only belong to a place that was already vacated in the Roman period, as occurred in Cerro del Villar but not in Malaka. The Phoenician city at Cerro del Villar lay in ruins {{at the beginning of the}} 6th century BC, when it was apparently resettled by the Phocaean Greeks.|$|E

The results show that the method identifies nine Chinese <b>urban</b> <b>clusters,</b> i. e., Pearl River Delta, Lower Yangtze River Valley, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region, Northeast China Plain, Middle Yangtze River Valley, Central China Plains, Western Taiwan Strait, Guanzhong and Chengdu-Chongqing <b>urban</b> <b>clusters.</b> This research represents the first study involving the computerized identification of Chinese <b>urban</b> <b>clusters.</b> Moreover, compared to other related studies, the study's approach, which combines transportation accessibility and socio-economic characteristics, is shown to be a distinct, effective and reliable way of identifying <b>urban</b> <b>clusters...</b>|$|R

40|$|Defining {{the limits}} of an urban {{agglomeration}} is essential both for fundamental and applied studies in quantitative and theoretical geography. A simple and consistent way for defining such <b>urban</b> <b>clusters</b> is important for performing different statistical analysis and comparisons. Traditionally, agglomerations are defined using a rather qualitative approach based on various statistical measures. This definition varies generally {{from one country to}} another, and the data taken into account are different. In this paper, we explore the use of the City Clustering Algorithm (CCA) for the agglomeration definition in Switzerland. This algorithm provides a systemic and easy way to define an urban area based only on population data. The CCA allows the specification of the spatial resolution for defining the <b>urban</b> <b>clusters.</b> The results from different resolutions are compared and analysed, and the effect of filtering the data investigated. Different scales and parameters allow highlighting different phenomena. The study of Zipf's law using the visual rank-size rule shows that it is valid only for some specific <b>urban</b> <b>clusters,</b> inside a narrow range of the spatial resolution of the CCA. The scale where emergence of one main cluster occurs can also be found in the analysis using Zipf's law. The study of the <b>urban</b> <b>clusters</b> at different scales using the lacunarity measure - a complementary measure to the fractal dimension - allows to highlight the change of scale at a given range...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{proposed}} {{a method to}} improve accuracy and spatial resolution of urban extent map by integration of ASTER/VNIR images and existing urban extent maps. The proposed method mainly consists of 1) unsupervised clustering on ASTER/VNIR images, 2) extracting <b>urban</b> <b>clusters</b> from clustered ASTER/VNIR images by overlaying existing urban extent maps, 3) calculating conditional probability under condition of urban or non-urban on the extracted <b>urban</b> <b>clusters</b> and existing <b>urban</b> extent maps against ground truth. We developed urban extent map with ASTER/VNIR images, MOD 12 Q 1 and GRUMP by proposed method at 101 sites of the world. As the result, spatial resolution is improved to 15 m, and user's accuracy and producer's accuracy of developed map is 69 % and 48 %, better than those of MOD 12 Q 1 and GRUMP.

The main aim of this paper is the definition of a methodological framework for the determination, analysis and cross-evaluation of <b>urban</b> <b>clusters</b> which are formulated within wider study areas, such as administrative regions. To this end, different methods and techniques are utilised, that stem from the fields of Statistics and Quantitative Spatial Analysis and which, during recent years, are all the more commonly applied to the different stages of Geographical Analysis. The definition of <b>urban</b> <b>clusters</b> is mainly based on different types of variables, such as the demographic characteristics of the cities, the number of public and private sector services located in them, as well as the total length of the different types of road network in the study area. Furthermore, a comparative indicator of spatial concentration is formulated that reflects the role and the relative weight of every urban area in the study region as well as its spatial influence. Such a measurement improves the definition and analysis of <b>urban</b> <b>clusters</b> and at the same time, constitutes an alternative assessment of their overall locational perspective. Both the proposed methodological framework and the formulated indicator are applied in the region of Thessaly, Greece. ...|$|R
