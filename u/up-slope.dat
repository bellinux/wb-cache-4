40|$|Wind {{pressure}} distributions on both {{surfaces of}} a cantilevered roof are {{measured on a}} wind tunnel model. The investigation covers a down-sloping roof configuration at - 5 ° roof angle and two <b>up-sloping</b> roof configurations of roof angles 5 ° and 10 °. The results supplement an earlier study made on a horizontal roof. The wind pressure pattern on the upper surface of an <b>up-sloping</b> roof suggests that there exists a preferred mode of flow separation on that surface. The pattern shows two localized regions of high suction, which are separately located towards the two ends of the roof span. On the <b>up-sloping</b> roofs, this pressure pattern is observed in the time-averaged mean distribution as well as during the occurrence instant of a peak total uplifting force on the roof. On the horizontal roof, this particular pattern of flow separation is not obviously observed in the time-averaged mean wind pressure pattern but is revealed by the conditional sampling technique which captures the wind pressure distribution during the generation of a peak uplifting force on the roof. The wind pressure signals are analysed to study {{the characteristics of the}} total wind force on the roof and also the wind forces on individual roof surfaces. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

25|$|Three {{years before}} Walcott died in 1927, the Harvard University {{professor}} Percy Raymond led {{a group of}} summer-school students to Walcott's camp and quarry. These field trips became a regular fixture, and Raymond's interest in the fossils led him to obtain permission to re-open the quarry. He also determined that a level slightly further <b>up-slope,</b> recognised but not exploited by Walcott, bore a slightly different fauna, and opened a new quarry – now termed the Raymond Quarry – at this level.|$|E
25|$|Giant {{elongate}} drifts form {{very large}} mounded elongated geometries {{parallel to the}} deepwater bottom-current flow. They are characterized by a near complete lack of parallel bedding. Mounded drifts are often bounded on one or both sides by non-depositional or erosional channels, sometimes known as moats. These drifts can be “tens to hundreds of kilometers long, tens of kilometers wide, and range from 0.1 to more than 1 km in relief above the surrounding seafloor”. Their length to width ratio ranges from 2:1 to 10:1. They can accumulate to thicknesses greater than 2km and can form anywhere from the upper slope to the deepest parts of the basin depending on the specific location of the bottom-current. Sedimentation rates range from 20 – 100 m/Ma. They tend to be finer-grained {{with a lot of}} mud, silt and biogenic material. Coarse-grained contourites are very rare. They may also form detached or separated versions due to seafloor topography and flow conditions. Detached drifts are isolated and migrate downslope while separated drifts typically are asymmetric in shape, tend to form {{at the base of a}} slope and migrate <b>up-slope.</b> Large sediment waves have been observed partially covering some giant elongate drifts.|$|E
25|$|Until 1975, no Canadian museum {{had its own}} {{collection}} of Burgess Shale fossils. With {{the work of the}} GSC and its associates, the shale was rising to prominence, and in 1975 the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) obtained permission from the National Parks authority, Parks Canada, to collect fossils from talus material in order to develop its own display. Parks Canada would redirect other museums' requests for material to the ROM, so the 1975 collection team gathered ample specimens to meet the anticipated teaching and display requirements. As well as 7750 specimens, this expedition yielded evidence that further fossil outcrops existed <b>up-slope,</b> and in 1981 a five-year reconnaissance program begun. This program would unearth further sites higher on Fossil Ridge; further around the steep cliffs of Mount Stephen; and on Odaray Mountain. These sites proved very productive, bearing a different fauna and spanning more time than the original beds. Excavation by ROM crews continues to this day, and has found fossils below the base of Walcott's quarry, and some 40km away near the Stanley Glacier. The ROM's collections now stand proud of 140,000 specimens, and is continually yielding important new species and redescriptions. Statistical analysis suggests that new species will continue to be discovered for years to come.|$|E
40|$|Measurement of force-frequency {{relationship}} (FFR) {{is useful}} {{in the evaluation of}} heart rate–dependent contractile dysfunction. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate a new Doppler-derived method for assessing FFR. Doppler velocity spectra at the left ventricular (LV) outﬂow tract was used to estimate mean blood ﬂow velocity (mBFV), ejection time (ET) and velocity-time integral. LV ejection force (LVF) was then calculated according to the law of conservation of momentum: 1060 kg/m 3 3 (mBFV[m/sec]/ET [s]) 3 Stroke volume (mL). A symptom-limited, graded, bicycle semi-supine exercise test was performed in 56 patients with LV dysfunction (LVejection fraction 527 ± 6 %). Measurements were obtained at baseline and serially during the test. The change in FFR was deﬁned as <b>up-sloping</b> when the peak LVF was higher than the baseline value. The change was biphasic when the trend was initially <b>up-sloping,</b> then down-sloping; it was ﬂat or negative when peak LVF was less than the baseline value. LVF was 30 ± 12 mN in patients with <b>up-sloping</b> FFR (n 5 39) and 15 ± 6 mN in those with biphasic or ﬂat FFR (n 5 17; p, 0. 0001). The ultrasound assessment of the FFR was highly concordant with a previously validated method based on pressure-end-systolic volume index ratio (k 5 0. 75; 95 % conﬁdence interval, (0. 55 – 94. 0).

The former had collected much information about the coast. He had learned from slaves that the old kingdoms of Loango, Mahango, and Angay are bounded eastwards, or inland, by Mayombe, a belt of forest, the threshold of the unknown interior. It begins the <b>up-slope</b> to the great Ghat ridge, which, visible after a day's journey, separates the coast from the central basin. A fortnight or three weeks' march leads to an open country, a land of metalliferous hills, where the people barter their goods against gunpowder and weapons, brought by traders from the east. These [...] "Orientals" [...] are now heard of almost all along the West African coast, and doubtless, in several places, the report will prove true.

He found the old despotism of Loango to be insignificant, reduced, in fact, to the strip of coast between the Quillu and the Luema-Lukallo Rivers.

40|$|The {{overflow}} {{of dense}} {{water from the}} Nordic Seas through the Faroese Channel system was investigated through combined laboratory experiments and numerical simulations using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology General Circulation Model. In the experimental study, a scaled, topographic representation of the Faroe-Shetland Channel, Wyville-Thomson Basin and Ridge and Faroe Bank Channel seabed bathymetry was constructed and mounted in a rotating tank. A series of parametric experiments was conducted using dye-tracing and drogue-tracking techniques to investigate deep-water overflow pathways and circulation patterns within the modelled region. In addition, {{the structure of the}} outflowing dense bottom water was investigated through density profiling along three cross-channel transects located in the Wyville-Thomson Basin and the converging, <b>up-sloping</b> approach to the Faroe Bank Channel. Results from the dye-tracing studies demonstrate a range of parametric conditions under which dense water overflow across the Wyville-Thomson Ridge is shown to occur, as defined by the Burger number, a non-dimensional length ratio and a dimensionless dense water volume flux parameter specified at the Faroe-Shetland Channel inlet boundary. Drogue-tracking measurements reveal the complex nature of flow paths and circulations generated in the modelled topography, particularly the development of a large anti-cyclonic gyre in the Wyville-Thompson Basin and <b>up-sloping</b> approach to the Faroe Bank Channel, which diverts the dense water outflow from the Faroese shelf towards the Wyville-Thomson Ridge, potentially promoting dense water spillage across the ridge itself. The presence of this circulation is also indicated by associated undulations in density isopycnals across the Wyville-Thomson Basin. Numerical simulations of parametric test cases for the main outflow pathways and density structure in a similarly-scaled Faroese Channels model domain indicate excellent qualitative agreement with the experimental observations and measurements. In addition, the comparisons show that strong temporal variability in the predicted outflow pathways and circulations have a strong influence in regulating the Faroe Bank Channel and Wyville-Thomson Ridge overflows, as well as in determining the overall response in the Faroese Channels to changes in the Faroe-Shetland Channel inlet boundary conditions. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

The developed two layer shallow water model accounts for both the entrainment between the two layers and the free surface. In addition it accounts for the space-time variations of the density in a gravity current.

40|$|The {{high-frequency}} times-series {{data collected}} during 28 th October to 21 st November 2006 onboard R/V Mirai provided {{the first evidence}} of short-term bio-physical coupling in the central equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO). The predominant feature of the thermal structure was the down-sloping of 28 oC-isotherm and <b>up-sloping</b> of 14 oC-isotherm indicating deepening of surface-layer and shoaling of lower-thermocline respectively. Concomitant with the deepening of surface-layer, nitracline and subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM) also deepened. From the prominent bi-weekly periodicity in the 14 oC-isotherm and the upward phase propagation in the meridional current velocity, we infer that shoaling was the response of mixed Rossby-Gravity (MRG) waves. Based on temperature and currents we propose that deepening of surface-layer {{was caused by the}} eastward advection of warmer waters associated with the weakening of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). This made the upper ocean more nutrient-depleted and biologically less-productive, an indication that the central EIO is returning to its pre-IOD condition. ...|$|R
40|$|The high-spin {{rotational}} {{bands in}} 168 Hf and the triaxial bands in Lu nuclei are analyzed using the configuration-constrained Cranked Nilsson-Strutinsky (CNS) model. Special attention {{is given to}} the <b>up-sloping</b> extruder orbitals. The relative alignment between the bands which appear to correspond to triaxial shape is also considered, including the yrast ultra-high spin band in 158 Er. This comparison suggests that the latter band is formed from rotation around the intermediate axis. In addition, the standard approximations of the CNS approach are investigated, indicating that the errors which are introduced by the neglect of off-shell matrix elements and the cut-off at 9 oscillator shells (N_{max}= 8) are essentially negligible compared to other uncertainties. On the other hand, the full inclusion of the hexadecapole degree of freedom is more significant; for example it leads to a decrease of the total energy of ~ 500 keV in the TSD region of 168 Hf.

40|$|The {{advance of}} {{the front of a}} dense gravity current {{propagating}} in a rectangular channel and V-shaped valley both horizontally and up a low slope is examined through theory, full-depth lock-release laboratory experiments and hydrostatic numerical simulations. Consistent with theory, experiments and simulations show that the front speed is relatively faster in the valley than in the channel. The front speed measured shortly after release from the lock is 5 % to 22 % smaller than theory with greater discrepancy found in <b>up-sloping</b> V-shaped valleys. By contrast, the simulated speed is about 6 % larger than theory showing no dependence on slope for rise-angles up to θ = 8 ◦. Unlike gravity currents in a channel, the current head is observed in experiments to be more turbulent when propagating in a V-shaped valley. The turbulence is presumably enhanced due to the lateral flows down the sloping sides of the valley. As a consequence, lateral momentum transport contributes to the observed lower initial speeds. A WKB-like theory predicting the deceleration of the current as it runs upslope agrees remarkably well with simulations and with most experiments, within errors.
