5|$|After being {{tracked by}} both Manchester <b>United</b> <b>and</b> Manchester City, {{he began his}} {{professional}} career at Birmingham City, where he signed a three-year contract {{at the age of}} 17. Following the departure of manager Steve Bruce, Burge was released by Birmingham in March 2008. He went on trial at League Two club Hereford <b>United</b> <b>and</b> League One side Cheltenham Town. He was verbally offered a short-term contract by Cheltenham manager Keith Downing, but the deal collapsed after Downing was replaced as the Cheltenham manager by Martin Allen. He instead joined up with League Two side Barnet. He made his debut for Barnet in the 4–0 home defeat by Notts County on 15 November 2008. This was the only appearance he made before his time there was disrupted by appendicitis, which ruled him out for four weeks. The club released him in January 2009.|$|E

However he attracted criticism from his manager {{at the end of}} January following heavy defeats to Northampton Town and Peterborough <b>United,</b> <b>and</b> was subsequently dropped. New manager Gudjon Thordarson told him {{that he would not be}} offered a new contract at the end of the season, thus ending Tomlinson's long association with the club.|$|E
