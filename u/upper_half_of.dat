5|$|Binary search {{works on}} sorted arrays. Binary search begins by {{comparing}} the middle element of the array with the target value. If the target value matches the middle element, {{its position in the}} array is returned. If the target value is less than or greater than the middle element, the search continues in the lower or <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the array, respectively, eliminating the other half from consideration.|$|E
50|$|It is a Siegel {{modular form}} of weight k and degree g. Here Pr is the {{integral}} points {{of a certain}} parabolic subgroup of the symplectic group, and Γr is the group of integral points of the degree g symplectic group. The variable τ is in the Siegel <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> plane <b>of</b> degree g. The function f is originally defined only for elements <b>of</b> the Siegel <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> plane <b>of</b> degree r, but extended to the Siegel <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> plane <b>of</b> degree g by projecting this to the smaller Siegel <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> plane.|$|R

5|$|In coal seams, coal {{balls are}} {{completely}} surrounded by coal. They are often found randomly {{scattered throughout the}} seam in isolated groups, usually in the <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the seam. Their occurrence in coal seams can be either extremely sporadic or regular; many coal seams {{have been found to}} contain no coal balls, while others have been found to contain so many coal balls that miners avoid the area entirely.|$|E
5|$|Interior colour schemes {{varied from}} model to model, but {{shared a common}} design approach. The {{entry-level}} XT featured a black plastic panel for the <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the dashboard, with either a black, charcoal, or beige panel for the lower half. Not all variants offered the distinctive colour palette; the sports variants could not be optioned with the two-tone interior.|$|E

5|$|The Wagga Wagga City Flag was {{designed}} by Mr H Ellis Tomlinson, MA, FHS and adopted in 1965. Currently, Wagga Wagga City Council holds the copyright to Tomlinson's design. The flag is officially square. The upper quarter of it contains eight stalks of wheat positioned so as to form two capital letters W on a vert (green) field. The lower quarter of the <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the flag contains a wavy blue line on gold (yellow) representing the river winding through the wheat fields. The {{lower half of the}} flag contains the head of a ram positioned centrally on a vert (green) field.|$|E
5|$|The {{installation}} of dams dramatically altered {{the landscape and}} ecosystem of the river. At one time, the Columbia {{was one of the}} top salmon-producing river systems in the world. Previously active fishing sites, such as Celilo Falls in the eastern Columbia River Gorge, have exhibited a sharp decline in fishing along the Columbia in the last century, and salmon populations have been dramatically reduced. Fish ladders have been installed at some dam sites to help the fish journey to spawning waters. Chief Joseph Dam has no fish ladders and completely blocks fish migration to the <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the Columbia River system.|$|E

Since then, the results deteriorated into {{the lower half of the}} rankings, until 2006, when Canadian-born Dale Begg-Smith won gold and four Australians qualified for the 35-man competition. Manuela Berchtold, the only female Australian representative in 2006, came 14th out of 30 competitors. In 2010, Begg-Smith won silver, while two other moguls racers, one male and one female, were outside the top half and did not pass the first round.|$|E
5|$|FITs {{were first}} {{formed in the}} early 1990s, {{as part of the}} Public Order Intelligence Unit (CO11), a section of the Public Order Branch of the Metropolitan Police. They {{initially}} targeted football fans, hunt saboteurs and political protesters (since at least 1996), using cameras, camcorders and audio recorders to conduct overt surveillance of the public. The police officers wear full uniform, and are intended to be a highly visible presence. Their uniform is sometimes different from normal police officers in that the <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> their yellow fluorescent jackets is blue. Civilian photographers are also employed by the police to work alongside FITs. According to Scotland Yard, the aim of FIT teams at protests is to record evidence of protesters in case disorder occurs later on at a protest.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{later became}} a vestryman for Copole Parish and Justice of the Peace in Westmoreland County. In 1723, Lee {{became a member of}} the House of Burgesses. He held this office until he was {{appointed}} to the Governor's Council in the Virginia General Assembly in 1733. This position was a lifetime appointment. The Council was made up of twelve appointees who were selected by the Governor of Virginia and was the <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the Virginia General Assembly. The lower half was made up of the House of Burgesses. This position also gave Lee the rank of Colonel, a military rank that was second only to the governor. Members of the Council were advisers to the governor and judges in the General Court of the colony. Their work led them to spend about a third of the year in the capital Williamsburg.|$|E

50|$|The {{upper class}} {{is known to}} hold 25% of the nation's wealth. This class shares {{something}} in common with the middle class. A division into two. The lower <b>half</b> who consist <b>of</b> new money, investments, and successful business owners. The majority who were originally Middle Class or rarely lower. The <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> consists <b>of</b> families who have been rich for generations. A point of reference in social reproduction brought along the ages. Those born into this class receive inheritances from those who die and so forth. Their descendants are sent off to the finest of schools leaving them with the most opportunities of all. They comprise 1% to 3% of the U.S. population. The lower half can be a blend, whereas the <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> consists <b>of</b> mostly white families.|$|R
5|$|The 18th Battalion {{was formed}} in September 1939 {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel John Gray. It was the first of three {{infantry}} battalions designated to make up the first echelon of the 2nd New Zealand Division, destined for overseas service. Its personnel, all volunteers, were drawn from the Northern Military District, which took in the <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the North Island of New Zealand. They were formed into four rifle companies, designated A to D and corresponding to the Auckland, Hauraki/Bay of Plenty/Rotorua, Northland and Waikato districts. A headquarters company included the specialist support troops; signallers, anti-aircraft and mortar platoons, pioneers and transport as well as administrative personnel.|$|E
5|$|The Panthers {{struggled}} {{during their}} early years and only once {{during their first}} four seasons did they finish in the <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the league table. The club's first coach, Alex Archer, left Nottingham after two seasons {{and was replaced by}} Archie Stinchcombe who would coach the team until 1955. Despite a lack of success in their formative years the team had a number of players who would become local heroes including forwards Les Strongman and Chick Zamick. Zamick {{became one of the most}} prolific scorers in the league and won the Nottingham Sportsman of the Year award on two occasions, defeating sportsmen such as the Notts County and England international footballer Tommy Lawton.|$|E
5|$|Watford's weak {{financial}} position was exposed in 2002–03, following {{the collapse of}} ITV Digital. The club was facing administration, but an agreement by players and staff to a 12% wage deferral helped the club's cash flow, and a run to the FA Cup semi-final generated vital revenue. Financial constraints saw {{a large number of}} players released that summer. After consolidating in 2003–04, the following season started well, with the club in the <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the Championship at the end of September. Poor form, however, saw the club drop towards the relegation zone. Despite reaching the semi-final of the League Cup, Watford's league form did not improve, and Lewington was sacked in March 2005. His successor, Aidy Boothroyd, led the club to Championship survival.|$|E

5|$|Between Tests, Bradman rested himself {{during the}} match against Northamptonshire, which started {{the day after}} the Test, as Hassett led Australia to victory by an innings. He {{returned}} for the match against Yorkshire. Bradman came in at 1/0 when Barnes fell for a duck and top-scored with 54 as Australia made 249. Bradman pulled many short balls and reached 50 in 76 minutes. After the hosts replied with 209, Bradman came in at 1/17 and put on 154 for the second wicket with Brown, ending with 86 as the match petered into a draw. His innings ended when Hutton caught him in the leg trap. Not wanting to tire his bowlers before the Second Test that started the day after next, Bradman showed little intent to win the match. The batsmen batted unhurriedly and set Yorkshire 329 for victory with only 70 minutes of play remaining and the hosts ended at 4/85. Yardley expressed his displeasure by allowing his part-timers to bowl and then promoting tail-enders to the <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the batting order in the second innings. The Australians were booed from the field by the spectators.|$|E
5|$|Boletus auripes {{somewhat}} resembles B.aurantiosplendens, but {{the latter}} species {{has a more}} variably colored cap that can be orange, brownish orange, or yellowish, and variable degrees of stem reticulation. B.hortonii has a similar color scheme but lacks reticulation on the stem. B.auripes bears a superficial resemblance in coloration to the Costa Rican species B.lychnipes, known only from a limited area in the northern Cordillera de Talamanca. The latter species may be distinguished {{by the lack of}} reticulations on the <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the stem, a brown or salmon-pink staining reaction on the stem in response to handling, and microscopically by a conspicuously sterile margin and prominent pseudocystidia. Retiboletus retipes is set apart from B.auripes by a darker cap, tubes that lack an olive tinge, and a stem that has more prominent reticulation extending down to the base. In contrast to B.auripes, B.impolitus has a floccose (wooly) or tomentose cap surface, and lacks an olive tinge on the tubes.|$|E
5|$|Mature {{specimens}} of Battarrea phalloides roughly resemble the typical agaric mushroom stature of stem and cap. However, {{rather than a}} cap with gills, this species has a spore sac atop the stem. When young, the fruit body is roughly spherical and completely encased in an outer wall (exoperidium) that later splits in a circumscissile fashion (along a circular or equatorial line), the lower wall forming a volva and the upper part forming scales that cover the inner wall. The upper part rolls upward and backward and eventually falls away in one piece, exposing a spore sac lined with a narrow ring of capillitium and spores. The spores are sticky. As these are carried away by the wind, the drying action of the latter cause {{the edges of the}} peridium to shrivel and roll up more, exposing more spores. This is continued until the <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the peridium has shriveled and blown away and there remains only a few spores, which may be washed away by rain.|$|E
