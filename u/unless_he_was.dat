5|$|On June 2, 1775, Jones' ships {{arrived in}} the port at Machias. However, they were met with {{resistance}} from the townspeople when Jones refused to sell his pork and flour <b>unless</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> allowed to load lumber for Boston. In a meeting on June 6, 1775, the townspeople voted against doing business with Jones. The hostile climate forced Jones to take action by ordering Moore to bring the Margaretta within firing distance of the town. The threat prompted the townspeople to meet for a second time, and they voted to permit trade. The Unity was docked at the wharf to begin unloading the supplies.|$|E
5|$|Saunders {{attended}} the local mission school at Lake Condah, {{where he did}} well in maths, geometry and languages. His father, meanwhile, taught Reg and Harry about the bush, and encouraged them to read Shakespeare and Australian literature. After completing eight years of schooling, Saunders earned his merit certificate. His formal education thus ended, {{he went to work}} at the age of 14 as a millhand in a sawmill. Employers regularly withheld payments for Aboriginal labourers at this time, but Saunders refused to work <b>unless</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> paid his full entitlement, and his employer relented. He worked and furthered his education until 1937, when he went into business with his father and brother, operating a sawmill in Portland, Victoria; the sawmill was destroyed in a bushfire in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Simon Spies, {{owner of}} Spies Rejser, speculated in February 1971 {{that he might}} merge his airline Conair of Scandinavia with Trans Polar, {{although}} he also stated that once his airline received new aircraft {{it would no longer}} necessarily need to charter aircraft from other airlines. Trans Polar was subject to a lawsuit by a laid-off pilot which the airline owed NOK26,600 in pay and compensation for him paying his own connection flights to reach Trans Polar charters. The company had issued several cheques and bills of exchange that had bounced and the pilot threatened to bankrupt the airline <b>unless</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> paid. The company responded that he would have a very difficult time bankrupting them and the press should instead write about the airline's future, which they regarded as very bright.|$|E

5|$|The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim signed Ramírez as an {{international}} free agent in February 2001. He made his professional debut in minor league baseball with the Arizona Angels of the Rookie-level Arizona League in the 2002 season. He pitched in 13 games for Arizona, and also pitched in two games for the Provo Angels of the Rookie-level Pioneer League. The Angels promoted Ramírez to Class A in the 2003 season. He pitched for the Cedar Rapids Kernels in the Class A Midwest League. He reached the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes of the Class A-Advanced California League. When the Angels invited players of the Quakes to Angel Stadium in Anaheim, Ramírez refused to leave the bleachers and step on the field <b>unless</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> invited {{to play for the}} Angels.|$|E
5|$|Unrepresented by management, Davis {{sent his}} script out {{unsolicited}} to agents and studios {{over the course}} of the next three years. Davis secured representation through his efforts and received a number of studio offers, but, in a story reminiscent of Sylvester Stallone's experience with Rocky, he refused to sell the script <b>unless</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> signed to play the title role. He also resisted demands that Marty be made heterosexual. While Davis and director O'Flaherty honed the script, Davis trained as a boxer to add to the film's authenticity. The film was shot in Los Angeles on high-definition digital video on a budget of $200,000 and was O'Flaherty's feature debut.|$|E
5|$|On March31 {{the insurgents}} kept their {{part of the}} {{agreement}} by allowing the supply bill to be passed on second reading and the budget to be hoisted for ninety days. However, when the cabinet introduced its promised bill, the insurgents claimed {{that it was not}} as agreed and refused to support it. Instead, they demanded Aberhart's resignation and announced that they were prepared to take over the government within 24hours. A delegation put this demand to Aberhart in the evening of March31; according to them, he agreed to resign if they allowed the supply bill to pass a third reading. They did so, but Aberhart denied that he had agreed to resign and refused to do so <b>unless</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> defeated in a general election. The insurgents, leery of Aberhart's oratorical powers and the reach of his weekly radio show, wanted to avoid an election. Even so, they rejected a motion by Low to raise their pay for the session by $200, seeing it as a crass bribe.|$|E

5|$|The {{position}} and rights of Scottish peers {{in relation to}} the House of Lords remained unclear during most of the eighteenth century. In 1711, The 4th Duke of Hamilton, a peer of Scotland, was made Duke of Brandon in the Peerage of Great Britain. When he sought to sit in the House of Lords, he was denied admittance, the Lords ruling that a peer of Scotland could not sit in the House of Lords <b>unless</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a representative peer, even if he also held a British peerage dignity. They reasoned that the Act of Union 1707 had established the number of Scots peers in the House of Lords at no more and no less than sixteen. In 1782, however, the House of Lords reversed the decision, holding that the Crown could admit anyone it pleases to the House of Lords, whether a Scottish peer or not, subject only to qualifications such as being of full age.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Indy recovers {{the cross}} {{off the coast}} of Portugal and donates it to Marcus Brody's museum. Later, Indy is {{introduced}} to Walter Donovan, who informs him that Indy's father, Henry Jones Sr., has vanished while searching for the Holy Grail, using an incomplete inscription as his guide. Indy then receives Henry's Grail diary via mail from Venice. Realizing that he would not have sent the diary <b>unless</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in trouble, Indy and Marcus travel to Venice, where they meet Henry's Austrian colleague, Dr. Elsa Schneider. Beneath the library where Henry was last seen, Indy and Elsa discover the tomb of a First Crusade knight, which also contains a complete version of the inscription that Henry had used, this one revealing the location of the Grail. They flee, however, when the catacombs are set aflame by the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, a secret society that protects the Grail from evildoers. Indy and Elsa capture one of the Brotherhood, Kazim, and Indy tells him that his goal is only to find his father and that he has no interest in finding the Grail. Kazim tells him that Henry is being held in Castle Brunwald on the Austrian-German border. Marcus later reveals a map drawn by Henry of the route to the Grail, which begins in Alexandretta. Indy removes the pages containing the map from the diary, gives it to Marcus for safekeeping and sends Marcus to İskenderun, the city built on the ruins of Alexandretta to rendezvous with their old friend Sallah, and he and Elsa head to Castle Brunwald.|$|E

25|$|Herbert Sutcliffe {{needed some}} getting out. He {{was a great}} battler for England and for Yorkshire. He never gave his wicket away <b>unless</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{satisfied}} he had made enough already. With Percy Holmes he formed just about the finest opening partnership I bowled against. I got him out cheaply a few times, but he scored a few hundreds against my bowling, so I reckon we ended up just about square.|$|E

25|$|Leg before wicket {{decisions}} are notoriously difficult to judge {{and only the}} umpire is in the correct position to judge {{the line of the}} ball and its height when its hits the batsmen. The lbw laws of the time meant that a batsman could not be lbw to a ball that pitched outside the off-stump <b>unless</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> also outside the off-stump. Though this was meant to encourage off-side strokeplay and prevent batsmen from padding away balls it resulted in batsmen padding-up to off-side balls while in front of the wicket and encouraged inswing bowlers such as Alec Bedser who normally hit the batsmen in front of the leg-stump.|$|E
25|$|The largest gun was a minion cannon {{which was}} brass, weighed about 1,200 pounds (545 kg), and could shoot a 3.5 pound (1.6 kg) {{cannonball}} almost a mile (1,600 m). The Mayflower also had {{on board a}} saker cannon of about 800 pounds (360 kg), and two base cannons that weighed about 200 pounds (90 kg) which shot a 3 to 5 ounce ball (85–140 g). She carried at least ten pieces of ordnance on the port and starboard sides of her gun deck: seven cannons for long range purposes, and three smaller guns often fired from the stern at close quarters that were filled with musket balls.
