40|$|The general {{economic}} torts - inducing {{breach of}} contract, conspiracy (in both its lawful <b>means</b> and <b>unlawful</b> <b>means</b> forms), intimidation and causing loss by <b>unlawful</b> <b>means</b> - inhibit interference with economic interests. The Australian common law regarding these torts is at a surprisingly {{early stage of}} development and there remains a need to resolve ongoing debates {{about the nature of}} the "control mechanisms" which should be employed to stop them from being "unmanageably broad". This paper considers four potential ways forward for inhibiting the scope of the torts: adjusting the tests of intention and targeting; clarification and "tweaking" of notions of unlawful means; the expansion of justification defences; and statutory exemptions. The paper explores the application of the economic torts to the context of environmental activism...|$|R

40|$|In the past, {{a number}} of English {{authorities}} have suggested that unlawful interference with trade (now also known as 2 ̆ 2 causing loss by <b>unlawful</b> <b>means</b> 2 ̆ 2) is a 2 ̆ 2 genus 2 ̆ 2 tort that provides the rationale as well as framework for analysing various economic torts including intimidation and conspiracy by <b>unlawful</b> <b>means.</b> However, this view has been decidedly rejected by the House of Lords in OBG Ltd. v. Allan. The majority judges in that case restricted the tort to one that redresses only unjustified interferences with third-party liberty. Since it has a multi-party structure, it is conceptually distinct from cases where liability has been imposed for direct (two-party) interferences. On this view, two-party intimidation, <b>unlawful</b> <b>means</b> conspiracy and causing loss by <b>unlawful</b> <b>means</b> are separate torts despite their common reliance on an independent legal wrong. It also {{means that there is}} no single thread that runs through this 2 ̆ 2 family 2 ̆ 2 of economic torts. While the element of illegality is an essential and common constituent of these torts, it is not the sole element that justifies the tort. Rather, each tort is founded on the combination of a particular course of conduct with the requisite unlawfulness. Consequently (and more controversially), it is now no longer meaningful to identify a single conception of 2 ̆ 2 <b>unlawful</b> <b>means</b> 2 ̆ 2 that is applicable to all these torts. In each case, it is essential to ensure that the illegality constitutes the tort only if it produces the type of conduct that the tort is designed to deter...|$|R
