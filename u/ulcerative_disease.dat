5000|$|Investigations were {{conducted}} in the 1970s and 1980s to search for infectious agents that cause or contribute to a severe <b>ulcerative</b> <b>disease,</b> known as epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS), which causes high mortalities among a variety of fish species in Asia and the Pacific region. [...] SNRV was isolated by virologist W. Wattanavijarn from a snakehead murrel, Channa striata (formerly Ophicepahalus striatus), a species of snakehead fish, which exhibited signs of epizootic ulcerative syndrome following an outbreak of this syndrome in Thailand. [...] The new viral isolate {{was identified as a}} rhabdovirus based on images and measurements taken via transmission electron microscopy and biochemical test results. [...] Plaque neutralization tests and immunofluorescence tests demonstrated that the new isolate was serologically unrelated to several other fish rhabdoviruses, including anquilla rhabdovirus (EVX), infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), pike fry rhabdovirus (PFRV), spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV), and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV). [...] Subsequent infection studies exposing healthy snakehead murrels from a susceptible population to SHNV did not develop clinical signs associated with EUS, suggesting that SHRV does not {{play a significant role in}} EUS.|$|E

The diagnosis of chancroid based on the clinical appearance of the genital lesion or on the isolation of H. ducreyi on selective medium is relatively insensitive. However, recent advances in nonculture diagnostic tests have enhanced our ability to diagnose chancroid. There has been renewed interest in understanding the pathogenesis of H. ducreyi. In vitro and in vivo models have been developed to help identify important virulence determinants.

The claim that circumcision {{reduces the risk of}} sexually transmitted infections has been repeated so frequently that many believe it is true. A systematic review and meta-analyses were performed on studies of genital discharge syndrome versus genital <b>ulcerative</b> <b>disease,</b> genital discharge syndrome, nonspecific urethritis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, genital <b>ulcerative</b> <b>disease,</b> chancroid, syphilis, herpes simplex virus, human papillomavirus, and contracting a sexually transmitted infection of any type. Chlamydia, gonorrhea, genital herpes, and human papillomavirus are not significantly impacted by circumcision. Syphilis showed mixed results with studies of prevalence suggesting intact men were at great risk and studies of incidence suggesting the opposite. Intact men appear to be of greater risk for genital <b>ulcerative</b> <b>disease</b> while at lower risk for genital discharge syndrome, nonspecific urethritis, genital warts, and the overall risk of any sexually transmitted infection. In studies of general populations, there is no clear or consistent positive impact of circumcision on the risk of individual sexually transmitted infections. Consequently, the prevention of sexually transmitted infections cannot rationally be interpreted as a benefit of circumcision, and any policy of circumcision for the general population to prevent sexually transmitted infections is not supported by the evidence in the medical literature. 1.

40|$|Introduction: Genital <b>ulcerative</b> <b>diseases</b> are a {{major public}} health problem. The advert of human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) /AIDS over the past 25 years has deepened the scope of morbidity, mortality, and various forms of clinical presentations of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Materials and Methods: A total of 50 cases having Genital <b>ulcerative</b> <b>diseases</b> and STD reporting to STD clinic {{during the period of}} the year from November 2005 to December 2006 were included and detailed history and clinical examination were carried out and provisional diagnosis is made. Laboratory confirmation of clinically diagnosed cases was done using laboratory tests such as S. HIV, venereal disease research laboratory, Tzanck smear, gram stain, and Giemsa stain. Result: In the present study, the incidence of herpes progenitalis was (38 %) followed by primary syphilis (32 %), chancroid (26 %), lymphogranuloma venereum (02 %), and genital scabies (02 %). HIV sero-positivity was detected in 12 % (n = 6) cases. Conclusion: HIV was found to be more common among genital ulcer disease patients, especially syphilis and genital herpes...|$|R
40|$|Background: Helicobacter pylori {{virulence}} {{factors are}} important in development of the clinical outcomes. The initial stage of colonization is binding of H. pylori to gastric epithelial cells through the babA protein. Heterogeneity among H. pylori strains in presence and expressing the babA gene may {{be a factor in}} the variation of clinical outcomes. Likewise, another recently H. pylori described virulence factor; iceA {{has been shown to be}} a marker for <b>ulcerative</b> <b>diseases.</b> objectives: We investigated the presence of babA 2, iceA 1 and iceA 2 H. pylori virulence factors in patients with clinical outcomes in the southeast of Iran. Patients and Methods: In this study, 63 positive culture samples out of 191 biopsies examined to determine of babA 2, iceA 1 and iceA 2 genes by PCR. DNA extracted from 63 Helicobacter positive specimens including 46 chronic active gastritis, 6 <b>ulcerative</b> <b>diseases</b> and non-ulcer dyspepsia 11. Results: The frequency of the babA 2, iceA 1 and iceA 2 genes in the total isolates were 34 (54 %), 14 (22. 2 %) and 34 (54 %), respectively. The association of these virulence factors based on sex and age groups were not statistically significant (P > 0. 05).

40|$|Wadden Sea was quantified. Thirty-two stations, {{located along}} seven transects {{including}} four estuaries, were sampled monthly or at 3 -month intervals with shrimp trawlers: more than 124 000 fish were studied. Six {{percent of the}} seven dominant fish species of> 12 cm length were diseased. In fish species which complete their life cycle in the Wadden Sea (gobies, hooknose, eelpout, sea scorpion) the total disease incidence was below 0. 4 %. In whiting, plaice and sole it was between 0. 5 and 2. 5 %, while 6 - 8 % of smelt, cod, eel, dab and flounder suffered from external lesions. The incidence of most diseases increased with increasing fish length. Similar geographical patterns in prevalence were observed for: (1) two types of skeletal deformities, (2) lymphocystis in dab and flounder, (3) papillomatosis in smelt and dab and (4) several infectious <b>ulcerative</b> <b>diseases.</b> Most of these <b>ulcerative</b> <b>diseases</b> of cod and flounder occurred on central estuarine stations, suggesting an impact of the relatively low, but greatly variable salinity on disease development.

40|$|Introduction & Objective: Different {{studies show}} that the reasons for {{clinically}} diverse outcomes of infections caused by H. pylori may include host and environmental factors as well as differences in the prevalence or expression of bacterial virulence factors. The aim {{of this study was to}} study the distribution of different genotypes of major virulence factors cagA, vacA and ureAB among H. pylori strains isolated from patients with gastric ulcer (<b>ulcerative</b> <b>disease)</b> and patients with gastritis (non <b>ulcerative</b> <b>disease).</b> Materials & Methods: In this cross sectional study 65 H. pylori strains, 30 from patients with gastric ulcer and 35 from patients with non ulcerative gastritis disease were investigated by RFLP-PCR. Results: The prevalence of vacA-positive strains in ulcerative patients was significantly more than that in non ulcerative patients (P 0. 05). Conclusion: It seems that in the patients under our study the presence of cagA gene may not necessarily be a risk factor for ulcer disease, while a homologous genotype of vacA appears to be associated with an increase risk of ulcer development. Lastly, despite the existence of a high degree of genomic variability within ureAB, conserved DNA banding profiles are distributed in our areas...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Recurrent aphthous {{stomatitis}} (RAS; recurrent aphthous ulcers; canker sores) {{belongs to}} the group of chronic, inflammatory, <b>ulcerative</b> <b>diseases</b> of the oral mucosa.

The results of currently performed studies indicate that genetically mediated disturbances of the innate and acquired immunity {{play an important role in}} the disease development. Factors that modify the immunologic response in RAS include: food allergies, vitamin and microelement deficiencies, hormonal and gastrointestinal disorders (e. g., celiac <b>disease,</b> Crohn’s <b>disease,</b> <b>ulcerative</b> colitis), some viral and bacterial infections, mechanical injuries and stress.

40|$|We {{recently}} {{described the}} use of PCR to identify the environmental source of Mycobacterium ulcerans during an outbreak of <b>ulcerative</b> <b>disease</b> that occurred in a localized region of southeast Australia. The PCR used was based on amplification of the M. ulcerans-specific insertion sequence, IS 2404. In this study we developed a new test that is a substantial improvement over the original PCR method in terms of sensitivity, reliability, and ease of use. In the new method magnetic bead sequence capture-PCR is used to detect two M. ulcerans sequences (IS 2404 and IS 2606) and total mycobacterial 16 S ribosomal DNA. We used sequence capture-PCR to test water and plant material collected over a 12 -month period during 1998 and 1999 from sites near the centers of two distinct foci of M. ulcerans infections. A golf course irrigation system in one area and a small shallow lake in another area repeatedly were PCR positive for M. ulcerans. Nearby sites and sites unrelated to the endemic areas were negative. Based on the PCR data, a most-probable-number method was used to estimate the concentration of M. ulcerans cells in positive samples from both regions. This procedure resulted in average concentrations of 0. 5 cell per 100 ml of water and 40 cells per 100 g of detritus. Loss of the PCR signal coincided with a decrease in <b>ulcerative</b> <b>disease</b> in each area. These results provide further evidence that M. ulcerans may be transmitted from a point environmental source and demonstrate the utility of magnetic bead sequence capture-PCR for identification of nonculturable microbial pathogens in the environment...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT [...] Based on the {{nucleotide}} {{sequences of}} 16 S rDNA, Japanese isolates of atypical Aeromonas salmonicida from different fish species {{can be divided}} into four groups; isolates from each species of fish (including fish reared in similar culture conditions) always belonged to the same group. Isolates from goldfish Carassius auratus had sequences identical to those from goldfish in the USA and formed the first group. Isolates from Japanese eel Anguilla japonica and marine fishes (greenling Hexagrammos otakii, Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus, shotted halibut Eopsetta grigorjewi and Schlegel's black rockfish Sebastes schlegeli) formed the second group, and had identical sequences with those of A. salmonicida subsp. achromogenes JCM 7875 T, A. salmonicida subsp. masoucida JCM 7873 T and A. salmonicida subsp. smithia ATCC 49393 T. The third and fourth groups composed of isolates from coloured carp Cyprinus carpio and common carp C. carpio, respectively. This indicates that the expansion of <b>ulcerative</b> <b>disease</b> in recent years is caused by strains which have phyletic lines different from goldfish isolates.
