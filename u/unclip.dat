Among the riders to crash were two previous winners of the race, Dan Martin and Simon Gerrans, as well as Fränk Schleck (Trek Factory Racing), Nicolas Roche (Sky), Mathias Frank (IAM) and Yukiya Arashiro (Europcar). Vincenzo Nibali was forced to <b>unclip</b> himself from his bike, but avoided crashing. The peloton was reduced to around 40 riders {{at the foot of the}} climb. Although there were no bad injuries in the crash, Roche and Arashiro took some time to stand up, with Roche looking particularly dazed. Many of the riders who crashed attempted to get back into the peloton, with Gerrans and Martin among them. Gerrans was forced to abandon the race shortly afterwards after he crashed for a second time.|$|E
25|$|Two {{or three}} plumbatae were {{typically}} clipped {{to a small}} wooden bracket {{on the inside of}} the large oval or round shields used at the time. Massed troops would <b>unclip</b> and hurl plumbatae as the enemy neared, hopefully stalling their movement and morale by making them clump together and huddle under their shields. With the enemy deprived of rapid movement and their visibility impaired by their own raised shields, the Roman troops were then better placed to exploit the tactical situation. It is unlikely plumbatae were viewed by the Romans as the killing blow, but more as a means of stalling the enemy at ranges greater than previously provided by the heavier and shorter ranged pilum.|$|E
2500|$|Cleaning was {{important}} and until a formal ritual had been devised {{it was a}} dangerous operation. The vibration in a mule threw a lot of short fibres (or fly) into the air. It tended to accumulate on the carriage behind the spindles and {{in the region of}} the drafting rollers. Piking the stick meant placing the hand though the yarnsheet, and unclipping two sticks of underclearer rollers from beneath the drafting rollers, drawing them through the 1 ¼ in gap between two ends, stripping them of fly and replacing them on the next inward run. Cleaning the carriage top was far more dangerous. The minder would stop the mule on the outward run, and raise his hands above his head. The piecers would enter under the yarn sheet with a scavenger cloth on the carriage spindle rail and a brush on the roller beam, and run bent double {{the entire length of the}} mule, avoiding the rails and draw bands, and not letting themselves touch the yarn sheet. When they had finished they would run to agreed positions of safety where the minder could see both of them, and the minder would <b>unclip</b> the stang and start the mule. Before this ritual was devised, boys had been crushed. The mule was [...] long, the minder's eyesight might not have been good, the air in the mill was clouded with fly and another minder's boys might have been mistaken for his. The ritual became encoded in law.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY <b>Unclipping</b> the one-kidney, one-clip {{hypertensive}} rat {{during a}} {{free flow of}} urine caused the blood pressure to return to normal levels within about 3 hours. We found that administration of captopril plus <b>unclipping</b> caused the blood pressure to return to normal in minutes (17 ± 4). Ureterocaval anastomosis plus captopril plus <b>unclipping</b> also caused the blood pressure to return to normal in minutes (8. 8 ± 2). Thus, the potentiation of the drop in blood pressure {{does not seem to}} be due to a volume effect. Administration of indomethacin and aprotinin did not prevent a rapid decline of the blood pressure after <b>unclipping,</b> but the decline was less rapid than that occurring after captopril and <b>unclipping,</b> which suggests that prostaglandin may have some effect on this mechanism. Saralasin administration did not potentiate the antihypertensive action of captopril plus <b>unclipping.</b> Chemical papillectomy prevented the drop in blood pressure after <b>unclipping.</b> The bolus dose of captopril to the hypertensive rat often caused a transient depressor effect resembling that due to the antihypertensive neutral renomedullary lipid, which suggests secretion of this lipid into the blood. The renomedullary interstitial cells accumulated large lipid granules after captopril administration. These cells also degranulated after <b>unclipping.</b> These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the renal papilla secretes an antihypertensive hormone after <b>unclipping.</b> At present, antihypertensiv...|$|R

40|$|Calcium {{blockade}} versus ACE inhibition in clipped and <b>unclipped</b> kidneys of 2 K- 1 C rats. ACE inhibitors {{have been}} shown to worsen the kidney damage occurring distal to a renal artery stenosis. To determine if this effect was due to the decrease of arterial pressure or to an inhibition of the formation of angiotensin, we compared the effects of equihypotensive doses of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) and a long-acting calcium antagonist (Ro 40 - 5967) in 2 K- 1 C rats. The rats were treated for five weeks with either enalapril, Ro 40 - 5967, or were left untreated. A group of sham operated rats was used as control. At the end of the five-week treatment period, proteinuria, plasma urea and creatinine were measured and quantitative morphometry of the clipped and <b>unclipped</b> kidneys was performed. Ro 40 - 5967, despite an absence of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system, worsened the lesions of the clipped kidney to the same extent as enalapril. In contrast, the effects of both drugs on the <b>unclipped</b> kidney were different. Ro 40 - 5967, and not enalapril, increased the weight and the glomerular surface area of the <b>unclipped</b> kidney. Ro 40 - 5967 did not change the glomerulosclerosis index, which was improved by enalapril. In contrast with enalapril, Ro 40 - 5967 decreased plasma urea and creatinine concentrations. Only enalapril decreased proteinuria which originated from the <b>unclipped</b> kidney as shown by nephrectomy experiments. We conclude that during ACE inhibition the fall in renal perfusion pressure seems to be the main determinant of the renal damage distal to a renal artery stenosis, independently of a blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. However, pharmacological effects other than the decrease of arterial pressure {{play an important role in}} the <b>unclipped</b> kidney...|$|R

40|$|Increased {{sympathetic}} {{nervous system}} activity has been demonstrated in established one-kidney one-clip hypertension in the rat. We have found that renal denervation in this model results in an attenuation of hypertension, unassociated with alterations in sodium or water balance or renin activity. To determine whether the depressor effect of renal denervation is associated with changes in peripheral {{sympathetic nervous system}} activity, sham operation (n = 12), renal denervation (n = 13), or <b>unclipping</b> (n = 13) was carried out 2 wk after the onset of one-kidney one-clip hypertension. Normotensive unine-phrectomized age- and sex-matched rats were used as controls (n = 14). Renal denervation resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} systolic blood pressure (201 ± 7 to 151 ± 6 mm Hg), while <b>unclipping</b> lowered systolic blood pressure to normotensive levels (130 ± 6 mm Hg). 8 d after operation plasma norepinephrine and mean arterial pressure before and after ganglionic blockade with 30 mg/kg hexamethonium bromide were measured in conscious, unrestrained, resting animals, as indices of peripheral sympathetic nervous system activity. Plasma norepinephrine was significantly higher in hypertensive sham-operated rats (422 ± 42 pg/ml) compared with normotensive controls (282 ± 25 pg/ml) (P < 0. 01). Both renal denervation and <b>unclipping</b> restored plasma norepinephrine to normal levels (273 ± 22 and 294 ± 24 pg/ml, respectively). Ganglionic blockade in hypertensive sham-operated animals resulted in a significantly greater decrease in mean arterial pressure than occurred in renal denervated, <b>unclipped,</b> or control rats. The data suggest that the depressor effect of renal denervation or <b>unclipping</b> in the one-kidney one-clip hypertensive rat is associated with a decrease in peripheral sympathetic nervous system activity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Clipping {{the winter}} coat in horses {{is done to}} improve heat {{dissipation}} during exercise and make grooming easier. It is often combined with blanketing to keep the horse warm. The aims {{of the present study}} were to investigate how clipping and the use of blankets affect thermoregulation during exercise and recovery in horses. Methods One Gotland pony, one New Forest pony, and one warm-blooded horse exercised one after the other on a 6450 m long track. The horses walked, trotted and cantered according to a predetermined scheme, which took about 50 minutes including three stops. The scheme was repeated on five consecutive days when horses were: 1) <b>unclipped</b> 2) unclipped[*]+[*]blanket during recovery, 3) left or right side clipped, 4) clipped, and 5) clipped[*]+[*]riding blanket[*]+[*]blanket during recovery. Heart rate (HR) was measured with telemetry, respiratory rate (RR) by counting flank contractions, skin temperatures by thermistor probes, and rectal temperature with a digital thermometer. Skin wetness (SW) was estimated by ocular inspection (dripping[*]=[*] 5, dry[*]=[*] 0). Results Mean outdoor temperature varied from - 1. 1 to - 8. 7 °C. HR increased progressively during exercise with no difference between treatments. Maximum RR was 77 ± 30 breaths/min (<b>unclipped)</b> and 49 ± 27 breaths/min (clipped). The lowest skin temperature was 17. 5 ± 2. 7 °C in a hind leg during exercise, which increased to 34. 5 ± 0. 1 °C during recovery. Rectal temperature was elevated during recovery in <b>unclipped,</b> but not in clipped horses and skin temperature at base of tail was elevated during recovery except in <b>unclipped</b> horses without blanket. Moisture after exercise scored 3. 2 ± 0. 8 in <b>unclipped</b> and zero in clipped horses. Discussion and conclusion Leg skin temperature initially dropped at onset of exercise in clipped horses, and then increased after about 30 minutes due to internal heat from the working muscles. These changes were not significant when clipped horses had riding blankets, whereas <b>unclipped</b> horses became overheated as judged from respiratory rate and elevated rectal temperature. Providing clipped horses with blankets dampened the changes in leg skin temperature during exercise. </p...|$|R

Methods: The animal groups were: (i) sham-clipped for 12 weeks; (ii) 2 K 1 C for 12 weeks; (iii) sham-clipped for 12 weeks and <b>unclipped</b> for 12 weeks; and (iv) 2 K 1 C for 12 weeks and <b>unclipped</b> for 12 weeks.

40|$|The {{experiments}} {{in this thesis}} were designed {{to examine the effects}} of surgical reversal of 2 -kidney, 1 -clip hypertension on baroreflexes and vascular capacitance. In the first set of experiments, baroreflex function was studied using a 'steady state' technique in conscious early phase 2 -kidney, 1 -clip rats before and 24 hours after surgical reversal of hypertension by <b>unclipping</b> or after pharmacological reduction of blood pressure by an infusion of hydralazine or captopril. A further group was studied 3 weeks after <b>unclipping.</b> With reduction of the blood pressure, the baroreflex was reset within 24 hours, irrespective of the method of blood pressure reduction, the degree of resetting being dependant on the level of blood pressure achieved. This resetting occurs without a change in baroreflex sensitivity. However, at 3 weeks after <b>unclipping,</b> the baroreflex sensitivity had returned to normal. In the second set of experiments, vascular capacitance was studied in conscious 2 -kidney, 1 -clip hypertensive rats and sham-clipped controls. Two further groups of 2 -kidney, 1 -clip rats were studied before and 6 hours after <b>unclipping</b> or a sham operation. Mean circulatory filling pressure (MCFP) was measured during a brief circulatory arrest by inflation of a right atrial balloon. Blood volume (BV) was measured by a radioisotopic dilution method and vascular compliance derived from the MCFP-BV curve. There was reduced vascular capacity in 2 -kidney, 1 -clip hypertension. Within 6 hours of <b>unclipping,</b> there was a marked reduction in mean circulatory filling pressure, with no change in blood volume or compliance, indicting a rapid increase in vascular capacity and reduction in venous tone. The third set of experiments explored the possible contribution of the renomedullary vasodepressor mechanisms to changes in vascular capacitance The model of chemical renal medullary damage secondary to bromoethylamine was used. In this study no difference in vascular capacitance was demonstrated, suggesting the lack of renomedullary vasodepressor mechanisms in the long-term had no demonstrable effect on venous tone...|$|R
