40|$|Abstract. I present work on {{a project}} to {{integrate}} Isabelle, an extremely versatile interactive proof assistant, with a combined decision procedure, the Cooperating Validity Checker (CVC). Isabelle is sound and flexible, however it is often tedious to use. CVC is fully automatic, but only handles decision problems expressible over a relatively weak set of theories including linear arithmetic, uninterpreted functions, data types, and firstorder quantifier-free logic. My goal {{is to increase the}} amount of automation in Isabelle, by making it use CVC as an oracle for such problems, but without compromising Isabelle’s soundness. In this paper I report on the progress made toward this goal. The key to retaining soundness is in CVC’s ability to produce proofs. I have implemented a basic infrastructure to translate these proofs into Isabelle tactics. This effort has revealed a number of issues that complicate the translation. One complication is an unwanted conversion from a logic of partial functions to classical logic. Another is the unsoundness off the CVC proof system, which makes part of a CVC proof unusable. Fortunately, we can regenerate the <b>unusable</b> <b>part</b> by mimicking CVC’s conversion. The current state of the project includes a detailed plan to work around the complications, and a partial implementation that handles part of first-order quantifier-free logic. 1...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the study of food chain models under batch and {{chemostat}} conditions where nutrient recycling is taken into account. The food chain is formed by a nutrient and two populations, prey and predator (producers and consumers). Species at both trophic levels digest their food source only partly. The <b>unusable</b> <b>part</b> of the food is ejected in the reactor as faeces together with metabolic products. The excreted material together with death material, detritus, is decomposed and this gives the recycling of the nutrient. In closed (batch-type environment) systems the elemental matter needed by producers must be provided through recycling where light energy from the environment supplies the necessary energy that fuels the life processes. In open (chemostat-type environment) systems this energy is added to the system via the chemical energy stored in the organic compounds in the inflow. Bifurcation analysis is used to study the effects of material recycling on the long-term dynamic behaviour of these simple food chains. An aggregation method is developed for situations in which each trophic level is characterized by differing time scales. This allows us to reduce the dimension of the model which gives good approximations after the fast transient. We will show that first-order approximations are needed {{in order to get the}} same qualitative long-term dynamics for both the full an...|$|E
40|$|Global rise in {{temperature}} and diminishing oil reserves has stimulated a market of alternative replacements to traditional petroleum based products. An alternative {{is the use}} of a bio refinery capable of converting biomass to the normally petroleum based products. The baker yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an attractive cell factory as its existing large-scale infrastructures for bioethanol production. However, it cannot utilize xylose, an otherwise <b>unusable</b> <b>part</b> of the plant biomass, which represents of utmost importance in the bio-refinery development. To also have a strain capable to produce a wide range of products, it {{could be used as a}} platform to base a bio refinery upon. Therefore, the aim of this study is to generate platform strains capable of forming acetyl-CoA, an intermediate metabolite in many of the cells metabolic reactions and also for many other industrially relevant bio-chemicals. With this goal in mind, the metabolism of S. cerevisiae was engineered. The genes encoding an isomerase-based xylose assimilation pathway (RTG, XI, XKS), and a phosphoketolase pathway (XPK, PTA), were cloned into the yeast strain CEN. PK 113 - 5 D to enable the yeast to take up and convert xylose into acetyl-CoA. The functionality of this synthetic pathway were evaluated for the production of 3 -hydroxypropionic acid via introduction of ACC 1 ** and MCR genes into the engineered strains. By characterisation of all the engineered strains on glucose growth we found increase of acetate production in strains with the phosphoketolase pathway expressed, indicating the in vivo activity of this pathway. However, expression of the xylose assimilation pathway through genome integration did not render the strains able to grow on xylose, suggesting the low efficiency of the assembled xylose assimilation pathway. To overcome this adaptive laboratory evolution is recommended...|$|E

50|$|Western Electric {{telephones}} were owned not by end customers but by {{the local}} Bell System telephone companies—all of which were subsidiaries of AT&T, which also owned Western Electric. Each phone was leased from the phone company {{on a monthly basis}} by customers who generally paid for their phone as part of the recurring lease fees. This system had the effect of subsidizing basic telephone service, keeping local phone service inexpensive, under $10 per month, including the leased phone. After divestiture, basic service prices increased, and customers were now responsible for inside building wiring and telephone equipment. The Bell System had an extensive policy and infrastructure to recycle or refurbish phones taken out of service, replacing all defective, weak, or otherwise <b>unusable</b> <b>parts</b> for new installations. This resulted in an extraordinary longevity of Western Electric telephone models and limited the variety of new designs introduced into the market place.|$|R

40|$|Every item produced, transported, {{used and}} {{discarded}} within a Supply Chain (SC) generates costs and creates {{an impact on}} the environment. The increase of forward flows as effects of market globalization and reverse flows due to legislation, warranty, recycling and disposal activities affect the ability of a modern SC to be economically and environmentally sustainable. In this context, the study considers an innovative sustainable closed loop SC problem. It first introduces a linear programming model that aims to minimize the total SC costs. Environmental sustainability is guaranteed by the complete reprocessing of an end-of-life product, the re-use of components, the disposal of <b>unusable</b> <b>parts</b> sent directly from the manufacturers, with a closed loop transportation system that maximizes transportation efficiency. Secondly, the authors consider the problem by means of a parametrical study, by analyzing the economical sustainability of the proposed CLSC model versus the classical Forward Supply Chain model (FWSC) from two perspectives: Case 1, the 'traditional company perspective', where the SC ends at the customers, and the disposal costs are not included in the SC, and Case 2, the 'social responsibility company perspective', where the disposal costs are considered within the SC.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a finite element algorithm for the simulation of thermo-hydrodynamic instabilities causing manufacturing defects in injection molding of plastic and metal powder. Mold-filling parameters determine the flow pattern during filling, {{which in turn}} influences {{the quality of the}} final part. Insufficiently, well-controlled operating conditions may generate inhomogeneities, empty spaces or <b>unusable</b> <b>parts.</b> An understanding of the flow behavior will enable manufacturers to reduce or even eliminate defects and improve their competitiveness. This work {{presents a}} rigorous study using numerical simulation and sensitivity analysis. The problem is modeled by the Navier 2 ̆ 013 Stokes equations, the energy equation and a generalized Newtonian viscosity model. The solution algorithm is applied to a simple flow in a symmetrical gate geometry. This problem exhibits both symmetrical and non-symmetrical solutions depending on the values taken by flow parameters. Under particular combinations of operating conditions, the flow was stable and symmetric, while some other combinations leading to large thermally induced viscosity gradients produce unstable and asymmetric flow. Based on the numerical results, a stability chart of the flow was established, identifying the boundaries between regions of stable and unstable flow in terms of the Graetz number (ratio of thermal conduction time to the convection time scale) and B, a dimensionless ratio indicating the sensitivity of viscosity to temperature changes. Sensitivities with respect to flow parameters are then computed using the continuous sensitivity equations method. We demonstrate that sensitivities are able to detect the transition between the stable and unstable flow regimes and correctly indicate how parameters should change in order to increase the stability of the flow.

50|$|Restoration of a vehicle’s {{exterior}} {{can take many}} forms. A vehicle that has been left or abandoned will often accumulate rust over time. Sometimes this rust deterioration can render an exterior <b>part</b> <b>unusable.</b> In which case a replacement part like a fender, front grill or door mirror much be purchased outright from an external source. If rust damage is minor however the part will undergo rust repair. This {{is the process of}} removing rust from metal and returning structural integrity. This is accomplished by removing the rust through sanding or blasting to get down to bare metal. Then new sheet metal or fiberglass is applied to the affected area. Finally the piece is worked until smooth, primed and re-painted. Other materials like glass and weather stripping must be replaced as they become damaged over time. Factors like weather erosion can lead to faded and broken glass as well as dried out weather stripping. Another typical area of exterior repair is dent removal. This entails taking the original metal and re-working it to remove dents and other such blemishes. Professionals often use hammer and dolly work to remove dents. This involves placing the dented metal piece over a curved metal dolly and using an electric or manual hammer to remove the dent and smooth the metal.|$|R

40|$|Analog-to-digital {{converter}} (ADC) is {{the main}} workhorse in a digital waveform recorder. Strictly speaking, an ADC is supposed to perform uniformly, irrespective {{of the characteristics of}} the signal to be acquired. However, because of certain hardware related inconsistencies, its performance declines, particularly, when acquiring non-repetitive, fast-rising, high frequency signals. The error and distortion contributed due to its declining performance, for the entire range of signals, can be comprehensively characterized by the static and dynamic nonlinearities. Actual testing of ADCs is the only way of estimating these indices. These characteristics reveal information at the microscopic level, such as bit-level aberrations, code transitions, response and settling trends, etc. These tests attain greater significance, when the digitizer is part of a reference measuring or a calibration system, because, the levels of accuracies to be achieved in such a setup may become comparable to the error introduced by the ADC. Hence, testing ADCs is a priority. International and national standards exist for testing digital waveform recorders and ADCs. For several years, the matter related to reducing static test time of high-resolution ADCs was highlighted through many publications. A critical examination of the literature indicates the major schools-of-thought pursued so far, are, (i) refinements to ramp/triangular signal based static testing, (ii) proposals for use of alternative methods and/or test signals for static test, (iii) innovative ways of achieving a relaxation in signal source requirements and, (iv) efforts to combine static and dynamic test into a single test with an appropriate test signal. As a consequence of the literature review, objectives of the thesis were formulated. They attempt to resolve- (i) Conceive a suitable test signal for simultaneous estimation of static and dynamic nonlinearity through a single test (ii) Explore possibility of employing a low-linearity ramp signal to estimate static nonlinearity (iii) Estimating static nonlinearity by exploiting linearity property of a sine signal • In {{the first part of the}} thesis, a method is proposed for the concurrent estimation of static and dynamic nonlinearity characteristics of an ADC, with the application of a single test signal. The novelty arises from the fact that the test signal proposed is new, and so is the concept of extracting the static and dynamic nonlinearity from the ADC output. This was achieved by conceiving a test signal, comprising of a high frequency sinusoid (which addresses the dynamic requirement), modulated by a low frequency ramp (which addresses the static requirement). • Static characteristics of an ADC can be determined directly from the histogram-based quasi-static approach by measuring the ADC output, when excited by an ideal ramp/triangular signal of sufficiently low frequency. This approach requires only a fraction of time compared to the conventional DC test, is straightforward, easy to implement, and, in principle is an accepted method as per the revised IEEE- 1057. However, the only drawback is that ramp signal sources are not ideal. Thus, nonlinearity present in the ramp signal gets superimposed on the measured ADC characteristics, which renders them, as such, <b>unusable.</b> The second <b>part</b> of the work describes a proposal to get rid of the ramp signal nonlinearity, before it is applied to the ADC. A simple method is presented which employs a low-linearity ramp signal, but yet causes only a fraction of influence on the measured ADC static characteristics. • The third part of the thesis describes a novel method to estimate the actual static characteristics of an ADC using a low frequency sine signal, say, less than 10 Hz, by employing the histogram-based approach. It is based on the well known fact that variation of sine signal is ‘reasonably linear,’ when the angle is small. In the proposed method, the ADC under test has to be ‘fed’ with this ‘linear’ portion of the sine wave. Due to harmonics and offset in input excitation, this ‘linear’ part of the sine signal is marginally different, compared to an ideal ramp signal of equal amplitude. However, since it is a sinusoid, this difference can be accurately determined and later compensated from the measured ADC output. Thus, the corrected ADC output will correspond to the true ADC static nonlinearity. The proposed approach successfully addresses all the three concerns while estimating static linearity, i. e. it is time-efficient, excites all the ADC code-bins reasonably uniformly and tackles the source linearity issue quite nicely. These proposals are novel, simple, easy to implement, time-efficient and importantly static nonlinearity characteristics determined from them are in good agreement with that estimated by the original DC-based technique. Implementation of each method is discussed along with experimental results, for two 8 -bit digital oscilloscopes and a 10 -bit real time digitizer. Further details are presented in the thesis...|$|R
