5|$|Amatsukaze {{approached}} SanFrancisco {{with the}} intention of finishing her off. While concentrating on SanFrancisco, Amatsukaze did not notice the approach of Helena, which fired several full broadsides at Amatsukaze from close range and knocked her out of the action. The heavily damaged Amatsukaze escaped <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> a smoke screen while Helena was distracted by an attack by Asagumo, Murasame, and Samidare.|$|E

5|$|After Aubers Ridge, {{the corps}} was then rested {{in a quiet}} sector until September, when it {{deployed}} for the Battle of Loos. The initial attack was {{to be made by}} three divisions, with the Meerut Division leading the attack on the Indian front; Blackader's brigade, with two Gurkha battalions and the 2nd Leicesters, was on its right flank. Whilst the attack successfully crossed no-man's land <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> the barrage, the right flank of the brigade was caught up in defensive wire, and only one battalion successfully made their way into the German trenches; the brigade lost momentum and dug in.|$|E
5|$|After {{the capture}} of Beersheba on 31 October, from 1 to 7 November, strong Ottoman rearguard units at Tel el Khuweilfe in the {{southern}} Judean Hills, at Hareira and Sheria on the maritime plain, and at Gaza close to the Mediterranean coast, held the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in heavy fighting. During this time the Ottoman Army was able to withdraw in good order; the rearguard garrisons retiring <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> darkness during the night of 8/9 November 1917.|$|E
5|$|American forces {{then began}} {{preparing}} {{to move against}} nearby Kiska island, termed Operation Cottage, the final fight in the Aleutian islands campaign. In August 1943, elements of the 7th Infantry Division took part in an amphibious assault on Kiska with a brigade from the 6th Canadian Infantry Division, {{only to find the}} island deserted by the Japanese. It was later discovered that the Japanese had withdrawn their 5,000-soldier garrison during the night of 28 July, <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> fog.|$|E

5|$|At 21:00 {{the first}} shells of what {{proved to be}} a two-hour North Korean {{artillery}} and mortar preparation against the American river positions of 2nd Platoon. As the barrage rolled on, North Korean infantry crossed the river and climbed the hills in the darkness <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> its fire. At 23:00 the barrage lifted and the North Koreans attacked 2nd Platoon, forcing it from the hill after a short fight. Similar assaults took place elsewhere along the battalion outpost line.|$|E
5|$|In the East, <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> {{ground fog}} the field army {{successfully}} {{withdrew from the}} Grebbe Line to the East Front without being bombed as had been feared, and disengaged from the gradually pursuing enemy troops. The new position had some severe drawbacks: the inundations were mostly not yet ready and the earthworks and berms needed because trenches would be flooded in the peat soil {{had not yet been}} constructed, so defences had to be improvised to accommodate the much larger number of troops.|$|E
5|$|In the North, the {{commander}} of 1. Kavalleriedivision, Major General Kurt Feldt, faced the unenviable task of having to advance over the Enclosure Dike {{because of a lack}} of ships. This dam was blocked by the Kornwerderzand Position, which protected a major sluice complex regulating the water level of Lake IJssel, which had to be sufficiently high to allow many Fortress Holland inundations to be maintained. The main fortifications contained 47mm antitank-guns. Long channel piers projected in front of and behind the sluices, on both the right and left; on these, pillboxes had been built which could place a heavy enfilading fire on the dam, which did not provide the slightest cover for any attacker. On 13 May the position was reinforced by a 20mm anti aircraft battery. It had been Feldt's intention to first destroy the position by a battery of siege mortars, but the train transporting it had been blocked on 10 May by a blown railway bridge at Winschoten. Several air attacks on 13 May had little effect; in the late afternoon five bicycle sections tried to approach the main bunker complex <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> an artillery bombardment, but soon fled after being fired upon; the first was pinned down and could only retreat <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> darkness, leaving behind some dead.|$|E

Chen's fellow activist Hu Jia stated that Chen had been {{planning}} escape for a long time, and had previously attempted to dig a tunnel for escape. In {{the weeks leading up}} to his escape, Chen gave his guards the impression that he was ill in bed, and stopped appearing outside the house, which allowed him several days before any absence would be discovered. <b>Under</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> darkness and with the help of his wife, Chen climbed over the wall around his house, breaking his foot in the process.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} October 1988, {{in and around}} Los Angeles, California. Shortly {{before the beginning of}} location shooting, Hollywood union truck drivers or teamsters went on strike to protest pay cuts and overtime changes. With deadlines looming, the production searched for non-union drivers, aware that the Teamsters might retaliate by sabotaging equipment or flying airplanes above the filming to ruin audio recordings. After one of the production's camera trucks exploded in the studio parking lot, the non-union drivers headed to Yosemite National Park <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> darkness with a police escort.|$|E
5|$|The E-boats laid up in {{the shelters}} during the day, safe from air–attack, and put to sea <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> night to attack Allied shipping. The pens were {{priority}} targets as the torpedo boats they protected were a considerable threat to the supply lines serving Allied forces in western Europe. Since August 1944, the two bunkers had been attacked four times by No. 9 Squadron and No. 617 Squadron of the RAF, {{with a total of}} 53 of the five–ton, Tallboy earthquake bombs. There had been numerous other attacks from bombers carrying smaller, conventional bombs.|$|E

50|$|In 1799, the British devised an {{evacuation}} plan in case a French relief force arrived. British forces were to gather at San Rocco Battery, and they were to retreat to Żabbar <b>under</b> the <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> San Rocco Redoubt. From there, they would retreat to Żejtun, and then to Fort Rohan <b>under</b> the <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> St. Lucian Redoubt.

5|$|To {{prevent this}} ship {{challenging}} British {{dominance in the}} theatre, the Royal Navy ordered a ship of the line from the Mediterranean fleet to intercept and capture Rivoli on her maiden voyage. Captain John Talbot of HMS Victorious arrived off Venice in mid-February and blockaded the port. When Rivoli attempted to escape <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> fog, Talbot chased her and forced her to surrender in a five-hour battle, Rivoli losing over half her crew wounded or dead.|$|E
5|$|Wisconsin was {{assigned}} to the 5th Fleet when Admiral Raymond A. Spruance relieved Admiral Halsey as Commander of the Fleet. She moved northward with the redesignated TF 58 as the carriers headed for the Tokyo area. On 16 February, the task force approached the Japanese coast <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> adverse weather conditions and achieved complete tactical surprise. As a result, Wisconsin and the other ships shot down 322 enemy planes and destroyed 177 more on the ground. Japanese shipping, both naval and merchant, also suffered drastically, as did hangars and aircraft installations.|$|E
5|$|According to Hayes' confession, {{the two men}} {{had planned}} to rob the Petit house <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> {{darkness}} leaving the family bound, but unharmed. Hayes attributed the outcome to a change of plan. Upon their arrival {{in the early hours of}} July 23, they found William Petit sleeping on a couch on the porch. Komisarjevsky struck William on the head with a baseball bat found in the yard and then tied him up at gunpoint in the basement. The children and their mother were then bound and locked in their respective rooms. Hayes said that he and Komisarjevsky were not satisfied with their haul, and that a bankbook was found which showed an available balance.|$|E

5|$|Admiral Scheer sailed in October 1940 on {{her first}} combat sortie. On the night of 31 October she slipped through the Denmark Strait and broke into the open Atlantic. Her B-Dienst radio {{intercept}} equipment identified the convoy HX-84, sailing from Halifax, Nova Scotia. Admiral Scheers Arado seaplanes located the convoy on 5 November 1940, The armed merchant cruiser , the sole escort for the convoy, issued {{a report of the}} German raider and attempted to prevent her from attacking the convoy. The convoy was ordered to scatter <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> a smoke screen. Admiral Scheers first salvo scored hits on Jervis Bay, disabling her wireless equipment and steering gear. Shells from her second salvo struck the bridge and killed her commander, Edward Fegen VC. Admiral Scheer quickly sank Jervis Bay, but the delay allowed the majority of the convoy to escape. The Admiral Scheer sank only five of the convoy's 37 ships, though a sixth was sunk by the Luftwaffe following the convoy's dispersal.|$|E
5|$|At 02:00 on 13 November, two squadrons of ship's boats made amphibious landings: a small force under Lieutenant Samuel Leslie landed to {{the north}} of the emplaced positions, acting as a {{diversion}} while the main body of the expeditionary force landed to the south under Lieutenant Colonel Smith. Leslie's diversion distracted the Arab defenders, but enough remained in the southern defences to make a significant counterattack on Smith's beachhead. Cannon fire from the ship's boats covering the landing drove the Arabs back, and Smith ordered his men to advance with their bayonets fixed, pushing into the town and driving out the Arabs house by house. To cover their advance, Smith's men set fire to the buildings in their path, which created a pall of smoke <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> which Smith was able to storm and capture the Sheik's palace.|$|E
5|$|Attempting {{to escape}} <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> {{darkness}} on 14 April, the French squadron was spotted {{by a number}} of small British ships stationed close inshore. These ships raised the alarm and the main British squadron followed in pursuit. The rearmost French ship of the line, Hautpoult, was closely followed by the small brig HMS Recruit, which succeeded in delaying Hautpoult long enough that the main British squadron was able to attack and overwhelm her in a running battle that lasted three days and ended off the coast of Puerto Rico. The British suffered 45 casualties, the French nearly 100. The remainder of the French squadron escaped, with the two surviving ships of the line sailing directly for France, eventually reaching Cherbourg in May.|$|E
