The duration of the version without Christmas hymns is comparable with that of an average Bach cantata. However, there are many differences: the Magnificat contains about twice as many movements as an average cantata, keeping it short by avoiding da capos in the arias, and altogether no recitatives. Also the text is in Latin (not the <b>usual</b> <b>language</b> for a Bach cantata), {{the architecture of the}} movements is fairly complex, as opposed to the fairly simple structure of an average cantata, and the choral writing is in five parts, [...] "outside the normal routine of Bach's sacred vocal works".|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} model concurrency, we extend automata theory from the <b>usual</b> word <b>languages</b> (sets of {{labelled}} linear orders) to sets of labelled series-parallel posets [...] - or, equivalently, to sets of terms in an algebra with two product operations: sequential and parallel. We first consider languages of posets having bounded width, and characterize them using depth-nilpotent algebras. Next we introduce series-rational expressions, a natural generalization {{of the usual}} rational expressions, {{as well as a}} notion of branching automaton. We show both a Myhill-Nerode theorem and a Kleene theorem. We also look at generalizations. Introduction In this paper, we seek to extend automata theory from the <b>usual</b> <b>languages</b> over words (labelled linearly ordered sets) to (labelled) posets which include more information regarding concurrency. This has been done earlier; we explain how our approach differs below. Let A be a finite nonempty alphabet. A language over A accepted by a finite automaton is said [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{language}} is regular {{if it can}} be recognized by a finite automaton. A {{language is}} dense if every word is a subword of some words in the language. It is well known that every language is associated with its syntactic monoid and a language is regular if and only if its syntactic monoid is finite. Moreover languages with semigroup structure are easier handle than the <b>usual</b> <b>languages.</b> In this paper we discuss some relations between languages and semigroups. An algorithm for the kernel of finite monoids, a monoid algorithm for density of regular languages and some semigroup properties of dense languages will be given...|$|R

It would be {{interesting}} to consider, as he suggests, the influence upon the progress of the human mind of the change from writing on such subjects as science, philosophy, and jurisprudence in Latin, to the <b>usual</b> <b>language</b> of each country. That change rendered the sciences more popular, but it increased the trouble of the scientific men in following the general march of knowledge. It caused a book to be read in one country by more men of inferior competence, but less read throughout Europe by men of superior light. And though it relieves men who have no leisure for extensive study from the trouble of learning Latin, it imposes upon profounder persons the necessity of learning a variety of modern languages.[69] Again, ground is broken for the most important reflection, in the remark that men preserve the prejudices of their childhood, their country, and their age, long after they have recognised all the truths necessary to destroy them.[70] Perhaps most instructive and most tranquillising of all is this, that the progress of physical knowledge is constantly destroying in silence erroneous opinions which had never seemed to be attacked.[71] And in reading history, how much ignorance and misinterpretation would have been avoided, if the student had but been careful to remember that 'the law as written and the law as administered; the principles of those in power, and the modification of their action by the sentiments of the governed; an institution as it emanates from those who form it, and the same institution realised; the religion of books, and that of the people; the apparent universality of a prejudice, and the substantial adhesion that it receives; these may all differ {{in such a way that}} the effects absolutely cease to answer to the public and recognised causes.'[72] ...|$|E

They can be defined as subsets of a free partially commutative monoid and a theory of trace languages can be developed, generalizing the <b>usual</b> formal <b>languages</b> theory. In this paper, the time complexity of membership problems for regular and context-free trace languages is investigated. It is proved that the membership problem for context free trace languages can be solved in time O(BM(nα)), where α is the dimension of the greatest clique of the concurrency relation C and BM(n) is the time required for multiplying two arbitrary n × n boolean matrices. For regular trace languages, our method gives an algorithm which requires O(nα) time. Finally, the uniform membership problem is shown to be NP-complete...|$|R
