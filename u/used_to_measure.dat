5|$|NAD and NADH {{also differ}} in their fluorescence. NADH in {{solution}} has an emission peak at 460nm and a fluorescence lifetime of 0.4nanoseconds, while the oxidized form of the coenzyme does not fluoresce. The properties of the fluorescence signal changes when NADH binds to proteins, so these changes can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>measure</b> dissociation constants, which are useful {{in the study of}} enzyme kinetics.

5|$|After the discovery, {{the rare}} element had only minor applications; for example, {{by the turn}} of the century, rhodium-containing {{thermocouples}} were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>measure</b> temperatures up to 1800°C. The first major application was electroplating for decorative uses and as corrosion-resistant coating. The introduction of the three-way catalytic converter by Volvo in 1976 increased the demand for rhodium. The previous catalytic converters used platinum or palladium, while the three-way catalytic converter used rhodium to reduce the amount of NOx in the exhaust.|$|E
