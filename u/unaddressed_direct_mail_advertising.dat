40|$|With {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} full-color digital presses {{in the commercial}} printing industry, personalization has been enabled to create one-to-one marketing communication to enhance the effectiveness of print media advertising. Prior researches showed an increase in response rates with data-driven personalized direct mailings. However, the impact of image personalization on response rate of <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> <b>advertising</b> is still unknown. This research used an experimental design to test the impact of image personalization on response rate of <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> <b>advertising.</b> A <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> postcard campaign was created with three levels of personalization (black-and-white name-only personalization, full-color name-only personalization, full-color name and image personalization) {{to test the hypothesis}} that there are no statistically significant differences between the response rates of <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> <b>advertising</b> with name-only personalization and with image personalization. The Cost Per Response (CPR) for three levels personalization was also observed. The experimental results showed that the response rates for postcard with full-color name and image personalization was 2. 6 %, and 3. 0 % for full-color name-only personalization. There were no statistically {{significant differences between the two}} levels personalization. Black-and-white name-only personalization postcard turned out to be the most cost effective <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> <b>advertising</b> with a CPR of $ 20. 50 USD, lower than both full-color name-only personalization ($ 26. 33 USD), and full-color name and image personalization ($ 30. 07 USD) postcard in this case. The reasons for observing these results include consumer behavior towards personalized <b>direct</b> <b>mail,</b> <b>advertising</b> objective, postcard design, product category, timing, and limitations of the experiment. Based on the results, commercial printing companies, especially those provide marketing services need to make a Return-On-Investment (ROI) analysis before recommending the <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> <b>advertising</b> campaign involving image personalization...|$|R

50|$|For example, if {{a company}} spends $100,000 on a <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> piece and it {{delivers}} $500,000 in incremental revenue, then the ROMI factor is 5.0. If the incremental contribution margin for that $500,000 in revenue is 60%, then the margin ROMI (the incremental margin for $100,000 of marketing spent) is $300,000 (= $500,000 x 60%). Of which, the $100,000 spent on <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> <b>advertising</b> will be subtracted and the difference will be divided by the same $100,000. Every dollar expended in <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> <b>advertising</b> translates to an additional $2 on the company's bottom line.|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the contribution of <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> <b>advertising</b> to average weekly unit sales of a national fast food franchisee. Two different types of <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> <b>advertising</b> are used, both independently and in conjunction with local and national advertising. Results of a field study indicate that one type of <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> (a shopper) contributes significantly to sales when used independently. When combined with national or local advertising, however, the contribution level of this shopper decreases. Conversely, a <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> insert combined with many others inserts into one single envelope is much more powerful when utilized in conjunction with national advertising. In fact, results show that this latter combination of <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> with national <b>advertising</b> contributes more to average weekly unit sales than any other combination. Implications are offered and future research is suggested. ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{we have seen}} {{significant}} increases in Internet activity and the adoption of new digital technology for sending and receiving communications. According to numerous reports, email now accounts for over 70 % of Internet activity. As Internet usage has increased, Internet advertising, and in particular email advertising, has evolved from simple-text, untargeted mass mailings to visually sophisticated highly-targeted interactive communication. ^ This study sought to compare and examine attitudes toward and responses to two forms of permission-based direct <b>advertising</b> – online <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> campaigns to traditional, postal <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> campaigns to determine what are the qualities peculiar to email advertising and its adopters and attitudes towards this medium that have lead to its adoption, acceptance, and possible preference as a channel of marketing communication. Self-administered surveys were sent via email and postal mail to a randomly selected sample of 400 supporters of a National Public Radio station housed at a large southwestern university. ^ Results showed that online <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> was not {{more likely to be}} responded to by study participants than traditional <b>direct</b> <b>mail,</b> did not generate more positive attitudes than traditional <b>direct</b> <b>mail,</b> and was no more likely to be read than traditional <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> <b>advertising.</b> However, online <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> <b>advertising</b> was viewed as prompting more radio station membership renewals, particularly among email survey respondents, suggesting that that online <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> <b>advertising</b> may result in more sales than traditional <b>direct</b> <b>mail.</b> ^ In examining the affects of demographics on the effectiveness of advertising media delivered through either online or <b>direct</b> <b>mail,</b> results showed that demographics make a significance difference in responses and attitudes, particularly in perceptions of convenience and ease-of-use of email <b>advertising.</b> ^ Keywords. <b>Direct</b> <b>mail</b> <b>advertising,</b> email advertising, permission-based marketing, advertising effectiveness. ...|$|R

50|$|American {{political}} campaigns have become heavily reliant on broadcast media and <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> <b>advertising</b> (typically designed and purchased through specialized consultants). Though virtually all campaign media are sometimes used {{at all levels}} (even candidates for local office {{have been known to}} purchase cable TV ads), smaller, lower-budget campaigns are typically more focused on <b>direct</b> <b>mail,</b> low-cost <b>advertising</b> (such as lawn signs), and direct voter contact. This reliance on expensive advertising is a leading factor behind the rise in the cost of running for office in the United States. This rising cost is considered by some to discourage those without well-monied connections, or money themselves, from running for office.|$|R

5000|$|Advertisers often refine <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> {{practices}} into targeted mailing, {{in which}} mail is sent following database analysis to select recipients considered {{most likely to}} respond positively. [...] This reduces costs for mailers by narrowing the mailing universe to only the most likely audience. For example, {{a person who has}} demonstrated an interest in golf may receive <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> for golf-related products, or perhaps for goods and services that are appropriate for golfers. This use of database analysis is a type of database marketing. Alternatively, <b>unaddressed</b> <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> may be sent on a neighbourhood-by-neighbourhood basis. Whether at the individual or neighbourhood level, <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> marketing allows recipients to be targeted, attempting to match the demographic profile of the recipients to one most closely matching that of likely customers. Individually targeted <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> may be tailored based on previous transactions and gathered data. For example, all male recipients of an offer may receive a personalized package with a man’s picture on the cover, while all female recipients receive a picture of a woman.|$|R

Distributed lag models are applied to time series data for an ethical drug to estimate the short-run, intermediate, and long-run effects on market share of expenditures made for journal <b>advertising,</b> <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> <b>advertising,</b> and samples and literature. Important differences were found among the communications variables with respect to the magnitude and over-time pattern of effect each had on market share. Significantly, the results indicate that the average historic allocation of resources to alternative communication vehicles has been in inverse relation to measured market response. A variety of econometric checks on the models lends credibility to the results. The managerial implications of the findings are discussed. ...|$|R
