25|$|Intuitively, {{imagine that}} {{we wish to}} {{transmit}} sequences comprising the 4 characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'. Thus, a message to be transmitted might be 'ABADDCAB'. Information theory gives a way of calculating the smallest possible amount of information that will convey this. If all 4 letters are equally likely (25%), we can do no better (over a binary channel) than to have 2 bits encode (in binary) each letter: 'A' might code as '00', 'B' as '01', 'C' as '10', and 'D' as '11'. Now suppose 'A' occurs with 70% probability, 'B' with 26%, and 'C' and 'D' with 2% each. We could assign variable length codes, so that receiving a '1' tells {{us to look at}} another bit <b>unless</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> already received 2 bits of sequential 1s. In this case, 'A' would be coded as '0' (one bit), 'B' as '10', and 'C' and 'D' as '110' and '111'. It is easy to see that 70% of the time only one bit needs to be sent, 26% of the time two bits, and only 4% of the time 3 bits. On average, then, fewer than 2 bits are required since the entropy is lower (owing to the high prevalence of 'A' followed by 'B' – together 96% of characters). The calculation of the sum of probability-weighted log probabilities measures and captures this effect.|$|E
500|$|Martin Lee {{said that}} [...] "according {{to all the}} {{evidence}} that has been reported, I believe that Mr. Lee had been taken against his will by certain law enforcement agents from across the border through illegal means". He described the disappearances as the [...] "most worrying thing {{that has happened in}} Hong Kong since the handover in 1997". Benny Tai and former chief secretary Anson Chan both said the case poses a genuine threat to the [...] "one country, two systems" [...] principle, which China ought to uphold. Former legislator Margaret Ng suggested that Hong Kong's status as a world city was coming into question, and said [...] "Hong Kong can be deemed to be no longer safe <b>unless</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a clear resolution of the problem". Albert Chan said [...] "this is the first time there has been such a clear violation of Hong Kong's law, a clear violation of 'one country, two systems' principle, that has taken place in such an open manner", and Lee Cheuk-yan, called the disappearances a [...] "milestone for suppression". Joseph Wong, former secretary for the Hong Kong civil service, also said that the incident will have drastic consequences as foreign confidence in the one country two systems policy may be irreparably damaged, which may in turn jeopardise Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.|$|E
500|$|Joystiq's Alexander Sliwinski {{wrote about}} Mileena {{that instead of}} [...] "focusing on her {{fighting}} style, or assets," [...] they simply could not [...] "get past one thing: how does she pronounce the letter P without touching her lips together?" [...] In 2010, Game Informer included her among the palette swap characters not wanted by {{them in the future}} Mortal Kombat games, later describing her in the 2011 game as being [...] "as creepy as ever." [...] When American radio host Howard Stern mocked a Mortal Kombat fan who admitted that he masturbates to Mileena, Matt Helgeson of Game Informer called the latter [...] "insane" [...] as [...] "onanism and Mileena should not mix." [...] Mike Harradence of PlayStation Universe wrote that [...] "as for the date theme , frankly we can’t really see the appeal – she’s not a patch on Sheeva, after all." [...] GameDaily praised the [...] "superb fashion sense" [...] of Soulcaliburs Taki by contrasting her with Mileena. Writing about [...] "outdated and cringe-worthy representations of women in video games" [...] in 2012, MMGN's Nathan Misa stated: [...] "Look, I like Lara Croft's booty shorts or Mileena's two...deadly sais as much as every other guy, but why not have more than virtual polygons to ogle at?" [...] Discussing what she perceived as video games' popular misconceptions about women, Sarah Ditum wrote in PlayStation Official Magazine that same year: [...] "Relax—we don’t really bite. Well, not <b>unless</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a face full of hell fangs at the top of an impossibly hot bod. Hellooo, Mileena." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{relation}} to democracy, PROUT argues that political {{democracy is not}} enough to free society from exploitation and what it considers extreme income inequality. [...] As Roar Bjonnes, a known PROUTist states, „ <b>Unless</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> deeper structural change – what we refer to as economic-systems change - we {{will never be able to}} solve such global and systemic problems as the environmental and inequality crises. History has demonstrated that political democracy is not enough“.|$|E
2500|$|Like most {{languages}} {{with few}} speakers, Lojban lacks {{much of an}} associated body of literature and its creative extensions have not been fully realized (the true potential of its attitudinal system, for example, is considered unlikely to be drawn out [...] "until and <b>unless</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> children raised entirely in a multi-cultural Lojban-speaking environment"). Also such collective or encyclopedic sources of knowledge like the , which may help expand the language's lexical horizon, are not very well developed.|$|E

6000|$|For, {{whatever}} perfection and costliness {{there may}} be in the present decorations, harnessing, and horsing of any English or Parisian wheel equipage, I apprehend that we can from none of them form any high ideal of wheel conveyance; and that <b>unless</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> seen an Egyptian king bending his bow with his horses at the gallop, or a Greek knight leaning with his poised lance over the shoulder of his charioteer, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no right to consider ourselves as thoroughly knowing what the word [...] "chariot," [...] in its noblest acceptation, means.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Twas the 1st of March when we quitted Bodmin, and {{quartered}} at large at Columb, St Dennis, and Truro, and the enemy took his quarters at Bodmin, posting his horse at the passes from Padstow on the north, to Wadebridge, Lostwithiel, and Fowey, spreading so {{from sea to}} sea, that now breaking through was impossible. There was no more room for counsel; for <b>unless</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> ships to carry us off, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{nothing to do but}} when we were fallen upon, to defend ourselves, and sell victory as dear as we could to the enemies.|$|R

2500|$|The day after, I {{asked my}} pilot, a cheerful young New Zealander, {{if he thought}} we really needed an escort.
