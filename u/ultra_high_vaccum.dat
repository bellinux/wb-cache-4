We first demonstrate that a very good flatness (0. 3 nm) can be obtained when growing directly GaP on a chemically prepared Si substrate. X-ray diffraction pole figure however demonstrates that a residual amount of micro-twins originating from the hetero-interface still remains. Silicon homoepitaxial buffer layer is then optimized in the UHVCVD chamber on different Si substrates misorientation (+/- 0. 15 - 6 °-off). A flat, clean and bistepped Si surface is achieved during the homoepitaxial growth on 6 °-off silicon substrates. Samples are then transferred under UHV conditions to the MBE chamber to perform GaP overgrowth. Keeping the same III-V overgrowth conditions, influence of silicon homoepitaxial buffer layer on micro-twins generation is determined quantitatively using Synchrotron X-Ray Diffraction. We finally demonstrate that growing a flat, clean and bistepped silicon buffer layer on a 6 °-off substrate, and transferring it under UHV to the MBE chamber for GaP overgrowth reduces significantly the amount of anisotropic defects generated in the GaP epilayers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This article {{explores the}} {{formation}} of graphene layers on 3 C-SiC(111) epilayers grown on silicon substrates using thermal annealing under <b>Ultra</b> <b>High</b> <b>Vaccum</b> (UHV) environment. The formation of graphene is demonstrated by use of near field microscopy (STM and AFM) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The evolution of the surface stoichiometry of the 3 C-SiC(111) pseudo substrates during the graphitization process {{is similar to that}} of the commonly used Si terminated α-SiC bulk substrates, starting from a Si rich to the C rich surface characterized by a () ° × 30 R 3636 diffraction pattern. Graphitization process leads to a strong modification of the surface at a microscopic scale which is compared to that reported in case of 6 H-SiC substrates. XPS spectra reveal the presence of typical C-C bonds related to a graphitic arrangement. Its high level of ordering is attested by the observation both of (6 × 6) SiC and (1 × 1) graphene surface reconstructions by STM. These results demonstrate {{the formation of}} graphene on 3 C-SiC(111) /Si pseudo substrates. They open perspectives for developing novel C/SiC/Si heterostructures and put light on the ability of 3 C-SiC/Si templates to become a low cost alternative of onerous α-SiC substrates...|$|E
