40|$|We {{examine the}} impacts of being awarded a Cal Grant, among the most generous state merit aid programs. We exploit {{variation}} in eligibility rules using GPA and family income cutoffs that are ex ante <b>unknown</b> to <b>applicants.</b> Cal Grant eligibility increases degree completion by 2 to 5 percentage points in our reduced form estimates. Cal Grant also induces modest shifts in institution choice at the income discontinuity. At ages 28 - 32, Cal Grant receipt increases by three percentage points the likelihood of living in California at the income discontinuity, and raises earnings by four percentage points at the GPA discontinuity...|$|R

The result is also stronger, since it holds for an <b>unknown</b> number of <b>applicants</b> and since the model is more tractable for applications.|$|R

This confirms our initial hypothesis that when information about minority group membership is <b>unknown,</b> minority <b>applicants</b> cannot face systematically different interview invitation probabilities. It furthermore appears that the introduction of anonymous job applications {{can lead to a}} reduction of discrimination—if discrimination is present in the initial situation. Anonymous job application can also have no effects if no discrimination is present initially, and they can stop measures such as affirmative action that may have been present before.

40|$|Though online {{technology}} has generated excitement about {{its potential to}} increase access to education, most {{research has focused on}} comparing student performance across online and in-person formats. We provide the first evidence that online education affects the number of people pursuing formal education. We study the Georgia Institute of Technology 2 ̆ 019 s Online M. S. in Computer Science, the earliest model to combine the inexpensive nature of online education with a highly-ranked degree program. Regression discontinuity estimates exploiting an admissions threshold <b>unknown</b> to <b>applicants</b> show that access to this online option substantially increases overall enrollment in formal education, expanding the pool of students rather than substituting for existing educational options. Demand for the online option is driven by mid-career Americans. By satisfying large, previously unmet demand for mid-career training, this single program will boost annual production of American computer science master 2 ̆ 019 s degrees by about seven percent. More generally, these results suggest that low-cost, high-quality online options may open opportunities for populations who would not otherwise pursue education...|$|R
40|$|We examine multi-period {{observation}} and selection problems with an <b>unknown</b> number of <b>applicants</b> in which applicants are interviewed {{one at a}} time on each period, recall of applicants that were interviewed and rejected is not possible, the decision on each period to reject or accept an applicant is based on relative ranks, and the objective is to maximize the probability of accepting the top ranked applicant. Having assessed the efficiency of three simple decision rules by simulation, we then test them competitively in a computer-controlled experiment. A cutoff decision rule, in which the first r - 1 applicants are rejected and then the first applicant who is ranked high than all previously observed applicants is accepted, outperforms the two other decision rules. Compared to the optimal policy, which uses the same cutoff decision rule, subjects stop the search too early. This behavior is accounted for by a model postulating an endogenous cost of search...|$|R

40|$|A static game-theoretic {{model is}} {{developed}} {{to examine the}} post- 9 / 11 interaction between the higher-education sector and the visa authority. We analyze {{the determination of the}} sponsorship of foreign scholars by the former and of visa scrutiny level by the latter, when some of the <b>applicants,</b> <b>unknown</b> to either party, are potential terrorists. When some genuine scholars are denied visa mistakenly, the intensity of visa screening is higher than its efficient level, but the number of students sponsored by the universities {{may or may not be}} higher. When delays associated with visa scrutiny cause some genuine scholars to be unable to enter, both the number of foreign scholars sponsored and the intensity of visa scrutiny are higher than their efficient levels. Under the same case, as the proportion of bad applicants (who are potential terrorists) for visas increases, the number of foreign scholars sponsored and the intensity of visa scrutiny increases, while there is a decline in the proportion of visa applicants granted visas. The basic analysis is extended to the case where the pool of applicants is endogenous. ...|$|R
50|$|Nebraska {{state courts}} {{strictly}} follow the common-law {{definition of the}} writ of coram nobis where the writ may only be issued to correct errors of fact. The writ may not be issued to correct errors of law. The Supreme Court of Nebraska provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Nebraska (Citations and quotes removed): The common-law writ of coram nobis exists in Nebraska under Nebraska Revised Statutes § 49-101 (Reissue 2010), which adopts English common law {{to the extent that}} it is not inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States, the organic law of this state, or any law passed by the Nebraska Legislature.The purpose of the writ of coram nobis is to bring before the court rendering judgment matters of fact which, if known at the time the judgment was rendered, would have prevented its rendition. It enables the court to recall some adjudication that was made while some fact existed which would have prevented rendition of the judgment but which, through no fault of the party, was not presented.The burden of proof in a proceeding to obtain a writ of coram nobis is upon the applicant claiming the error, and the alleged error of fact must be such as would have prevented a conviction. It is not enough to show that it might have caused a different result.A writ of coram nobis reaches only matters of fact <b>unknown</b> to the <b>applicant</b> at the time of judgment, not discoverable through reasonable diligence, and which are of a nature that, if known by the court, would have prevented entry of judgment. The writ of coram nobis is not available to correct errors of law.|$|R
40|$|It is unchanging black letter {{law that}} a {{contract}} of insurance is {{a transfer of}} risk. The insurer collects premiums from a group and pools them to cover the losses and the operating costs of the insurer. Individuals fund the operation {{of a system that}} achieves a social good in an effective and efficient manner. The perfect operation of the system can be thwarted by free riders in two ways. First, when individuals who have chosen not to participate in the group attempt to transfer risk for a loss that already has occurred, the prevalence of the risk is altered in the group. Second, the system also is defeated to the extent that legitimate losses are not indemnified. Judicial doctrines have attempted to find solutions that balance the desire to protect innocent insureds with the desire to avoid encouraging insurance fraud. One of those doctrines is the so-called “first manifest” doctrine. This doctrine uses policy language to avoid incontestability facilitated fraud by allowing coverage, but limits the risks transferred to those intended by the contract. The doctrine allows the insurer to deny a specific claim for a concealed condition while allowing the insured to keep coverage under the policy in effect for any condition that was <b>unknown</b> to the <b>applicant.</b> This article discusses a recent leading case in the area, Paul Revere Life Insurance Co. v. Haas. Haas represents an example of a state supreme court making new law to achieve policy objectives. Analysis of Haas and similar cases in other jurisdictions suggests that the relevant policy factors behind both incontestability and exceptions to incontestability can be described in equation form. A review of historical trends suggests that those variables leading to legislative recognition of incontestability have been supplanted by other factors. In contrast, those variables leading to judicial exceptions to incontestability, including insurance fraud, have become more prominent. This perspective suggests that recent first manifest cases represent a judicial balancing of an equation thrown out of balance by rising insurance fraud. Finally, the economic perspective suggests that the doctrine is a more efficient way to achieve multiple policy goals than the legislative alternative available in some states...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} three chapters {{that fall}} under the broad banner of development economics, with a particular focus {{on the study of}} mechanisms and strategies that improve public goods delivery. The first chapter studies the role of financial incentives as signals of job attributes when these are <b>unknown</b> to potential <b>applicants.</b> I create experimental variation in expected earnings and use it to estimate the effect of financial incentives on candidates’ perception of a newly created health worker position in Uganda and, through this, on the size and composition of the applicant pool. I find that more lucrative positions are perceived as entailing a lower positive externality for the community, and discourage agents with strong prosocial preferences from applying. While higher financial incentives attract more applicants and increase the probability of filling a vacancy, they hamper retention and performance. This is because the signal they convey reduces the ability to recruit the most socially motivated agents, who are found to stay longer on the job and to perform better. The second chapter analyzes the role of social connections on the targeting choices of delivery agents. During the expansion of an agriculture extension program in Uganda, we randomly selected one delivery agent out of two eligible candidates per community. We find that social connections matter: relative to farmers connected only to the non-selected candidate, those connected only to the selected delivery agent benefit more from the program. They are indeed more likely to receive advice, training and more likely to adopt improved seeds, a new beneficial technology. We show that these results are consistent with delivery agents (a) putting positive weight on the utility of farmers connected to them (altruism) and (b) putting a negative weight on the utility of farmers connected to the rival candidate (spite). This sheds light on the importance of both positive and negative social preferences in shaping program delivery. The third chapter studies the effect of movement restrictions on education. The evidence is based on the construction of the West Bank Separation Barrier in 2003. The exposure of an individual to the Barrier is determined both by her locality of residence and by whether she was in school or about to start school when the Barrier was built. Using a difference-indifferences approach, I find that movement restrictions increase the probability of dropping out from elementary and preparatory school by 3. 7 and 6 percentage points respectively, i. e. a 50...|$|R
