40|$|OBJECTIVES: Endovascular {{repair of}} the {{descending}} thoracic aorta {{is a very}} promising technique in elective and, particularly, emergency situations. This study assessed the impact of <b>urgency</b> of the <b>procedure</b> on outcome and mid-term {{quality of life in}} surviving patients. METHODS: Post hoc analysis of prospectively collected data of 58 consecutive patients (January 2001 -December 2005) with surgical pathologies of the descending thoracic aorta treated by endovascular means. Six patients were excluded due to recent operations on the ascending aorta before thoracic endovascular repair. The remaining patients (n= 52) were 69 +/- 10 years old, and 43 were men (83 %). Twenty-seven had been treated electively, and 25 for emergency indications. Reasons for emergency were acute type B aortic dissections with or without malperfusion syndrome in 14, and aortic ruptures in 11 cases. Follow-up was 29 +/- 16 months. Endpoints were perioperative and late morbidity and mortality rates and long-term quality of life as assessed by the short form health survey (SF- 36) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaires. RESULTS: Cohorts were comparable regarding age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, and comorbidities. Perioperative mortality was somewhat higher in emergency cases (12 % vs 4 %, p= 0. 34). Paraplegia occurred in one patient in each cohort (4 %). Overall quality of life after {{two and a half years}} was similar in both treatment cohorts: 72 (58 - 124) after emergency, and 85 (61 - 105) after elective endovascular aortic repair (p= 0. 98). Normal scores range from 85 to 115. Anxiety and depression scores were in the normal range and comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Thoracic endovascular aortic repair is an excellent and safe treatment option for the diseased descending aorta, particularly in emergency situations. Early morbidity and mortality rates can be kept very low.

Background: Despite growing recognition of children's {{right to be}} consulted regarding their healthcare, {{the issue of how}} to proceed when faced with a child unwilling to undergo induction of general anaesthesia remains relatively unaddressed. Methods: APA members were surveyed regarding their use or avoidance of physical restraint and alternate techniques to facilitate induction; factors affecting choice of technique; and extent of preoperative discussion. The anonymous online survey used both structured and free-text responses. Results: Of 596 surveys, 310 were returned, a 52 % response rate. Use of physical restraint and extent of restraint employed declines with increasing child age. Distraction techniques are frequently employed for children under 6 years old, with use of sedative premedication increasing as child age increases. <b>Urgency</b> of <b>procedure,</b> developmental delay, and preoperative discussion all have an affect.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} is to report our {{experience}} in the surgical repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) over the last 27 years against the background of evolving surgical techniques. MethodsWe reviewed the prospectively collected data of 571 patients who underwent open TAAA repair between 1981 and 2008. Data were analysed using univariate and multivariate analysis (logistic regression). Pre-, intra- and postoperative risk factors were used to develop risk models for in-hospital mortality, spinal cord deficit and renal failure. Recent published series were used to highlight the different treatment modalities and explore results. ResultsSeventy patients (12. 3 %) died in the hospital, the 30 -day mortality was 8. 9 %, 37 patients (6. 5 %) required postoperative dialysis and 47 patients (8. 3 %) developed paraplegia or paraparesis. The incidence of paraplegia in the left heart bypass group was 4. 4 %. The predictors for hospital mortality were increasing age (odds ratio 1. 096 per year, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 05 – 1. 14) and the need for haemodialysis (odds ratio 10, 95 % CI: 4. 7 – 21. 1). For postoperative spinal cord deficit, we found three protecting factors: age above 75 years (odds ratio 0. 14, 95 % CI: 0. 19 – 1. 09), the presence of a post-dissection aneurysm (odds ratio 0. 4, 95 % CI: 0. 17 – 0. 94) and the combined use of cerebrospinal fluid drainage and motor-evoked potentials (odds ratio 0. 28, 95 % CI: 0. 14 – 0. 56). The <b>urgency</b> of <b>procedure</b> (odds ratio 4, 95 % CI: 1. 8 – 9) and preoperative serum creatinine level (odds ratio 1. 007 per micromole per litre, 95 % CI: 1. 0 – 1. 01) were significant risk factors for renal failure.

40|$|AIM: To {{identify}} {{risk factors}} to help predict which patients {{are likely to}} fail to appear for an endoscopic procedure. METHODS: This was a retrospective, chart review, cohort study in a Canadian, tertiary care, academic, hospital-based endoscopy clinic. Patients included were: those undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy and patients who failed to appear were compared to a control group. The main outcome measure was a multivariate analysis of factors associated with truancy from scheduled endoscopic procedures. Factors analyzed included gender, age, waiting time, type of procedure, referring physician, distance to hospital, first or subsequent endoscopic procedure or encounter with gastroenterologist, and <b>urgency</b> of the <b>procedure.</b> RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-four patients did not show up for their scheduled appointment. Compared to a control group, factors statistically significantly associated with truancy in the multivariate analysis were: non-urgent vs urgent procedure (OR 1. 62, 95 % CI 1. 06, 2. 450), referred by a specialist vs a family doctor (OR 2. 76, 95 % CI 1. 31, 5. 52) and office-based consult prior to endoscopy vs consult and endoscopic procedure during the same appointment (OR 2. 24, 95 % CI 1. 33, 3. 78).

The use of these drugs is associated with an increased risk of bleeding during an endoscopic procedure, and their discontinuation leads to an increased risk of a thromboembolic event. The paper presents how to assess risk and how to prepare a patient treated with antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs for endoscopic procedures. In each case, one should consider indications and planned duration of treatment as well as <b>urgency</b> of  the <b>procedure.</b> Diagnostic gastroscopy and  colonoscopy do  not usually require treatment modification, while the procedures with increased risk of bleeding require a change in therapy. In the case of antiplatelet drugs, it may be needed to stop it at a proper time before endoscopy. In the case of a dual antiplatelet therapy, when there are absolute indications for its use, one should consider postponing the procedure. Patients with increased risk of bleeding, treated with vitamin K antagonists, should have the treatment temporarily stopped and replaced with a bridging therapy with low molecular weight heparin; if the thromboembolic risk is assessed as low, a bridge therapy is not needed. The time to suspend the use of oral anticoagulants which are non-vitamin K antagonists depends on the risk of bleeding and renal function. Decisions concerning treatment may require consultation of a specialist ordering the anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy as well as the opinion of an endoscopy centre in which the procedure is to be conducted.

40|$|ObjectiveOur {{objective}} was to identify risk factors associated with 30 -day mortality after isolated coronary artery bypass grafting in the Australian context {{and to develop a}} preoperative model for 30 -day mortality risk prediction. Summary Background DataPreoperative risk associated with cardiac surgery can be ascertained through a variety of risk prediction models, none of which is specific to the Australian population. Recently, it was shown that the widely used EuroSCORE model validated poorly for an Australian cohort. Hence, a valid model is required to appropriately guide surgeons and patients in assessing preoperative risk. MethodsData from the Australasian Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons database project was used. All patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting between July 2001 and June 2005 were included for analysis. The data were divided into creation and validation sets. The data in the creation set was used to develop the model and then the model was validated in the validation set. Preoperative variables with a P value of less than. 25 in χ 2 analysis were entered into multiple logistic regression analysis to develop a preoperative predictive model. Bootstrap and backward elimination methods were used to identify variables that are truly independent predictors of mortality, and 6 candidate models were identified. The Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and prediction mean square error were used to select the final model (AusSCORE) from this group of candidate models. The AusSCORE model was then validated by average receiver operating characteristic, the P value for the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, and prediction mean square error obtained from n-fold validation. ResultsOver the 4 -year period, 11, 823 patients underwent cardiac surgery, of whom 65. 9 % (7709) had isolated coronary bypass procedures. The 30 -day mortality rate for this group was 1. 74 % (134 / 7709). Factors selected as independent predictors in the preoperative isolated coronary bypass AusSCORE model were as follows: age, New York Heart Association class, ejection fraction estimate, <b>urgency</b> of <b>procedure,</b> previous cardiac surgery, hypercholesterolemia (lipid-lowering treatment), peripheral vascular disease, and cardiogenic shock. The average area under the receiver operating characteristic was 0. 834, the P value for the Hosmer–Lemeshow χ 2 test statistic was 0. 2415, and the prediction mean square error was 0. 01869.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The European Surgical Outcomes Study {{described}} mortality following in-patient surgery. Several {{factors were}} identified that {{were able to}} predict poor outcomes in a multivariate analysis. These included age, <b>procedure</b> <b>urgency,</b> severity and type and the American Association of Anaesthesia score. This study describes in greater detail {{the relationship between the}} American Association of Anaesthesia score and postoperative mortality. METHODS: Patients in this 7 -day cohort study were enrolled in April 2011. Consecutive patients aged 16 years and older undergoing inpatient non-cardiac surgery with a recorded American Association of Anaesthesia score in 498 hospitals across 28 European nations were included and followed up for a maximum of 60 days. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Decision tree analysis with the CHAID (SPSS) system was used to delineate nodes associated with mortality. RESULTS: The study enrolled 46, 539 patients. Due to missing values, 873 patients were excluded, resulting in the analysis of 45, 666 patients. Increasing American Association of Anaesthesia scores were associated with increased admission rates to intensive care and higher mortality rates. Despite a progressive relationship with mortality, discrimination was poor, with an area under the ROC curve of 0. 658 (95 % CI 0. 642 - 0. 6775). Using regression trees (CHAID), we identified four discrete American Association of Anaesthesia nodes associated with mortality, with American Association of Anaesthesia 1 and American Association of Anaesthesia 2 compressed into the same node. CONCLUSION: The American Association of Anaesthesia score can be used to determine higher risk groups of surgical patients, but clinicians cannot use the score to discriminate between grades 1 and 2. Overall, the discriminatory power of the model was less than acceptable for widespread use...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} update and {{validate}} a contemporary model for inpatient mortality following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), including variables indicating high clinical risk. BackgroundRecently, new variables {{were added to the}} CathPCI Registry data collection form. This modification allowed us to better characterize the risk of death, including recent cardiac arrest and duration of cardiogenic shock. MethodsData from 1, 208, 137 PCI procedures performed between July 2009 and June 2011 at 1, 252 CathPCI Registry sites were used to develop both a “full” and pre-catheterization PCI in-hospital mortality risk model using logistic regression. To support prospective implementation, a simplified bedside risk score was derived from the pre-catheterization risk model. Model performance was assessed by discrimination and calibration metrics in a separate split sample. ResultsIn-hospital mortality was 1. 4 %, ranging from 0. 2 % among elective cases (45. 1 % of total cases) to 65. 9 % among patients with shock and recent cardiac arrest (0. 2 % of total cases). Cardiogenic shock and <b>procedure</b> <b>urgency</b> were the most predictive of inpatient mortality, whereas the presence of a chronic total occlusion, subacute stent thrombosis, and left main lesion location were significant angiographic predictors. The full, pre-catheterization, and bedside risk prediction models performed well in the overall validation sample (C-indexes 0. 930, 0. 928, 0. 925, respectively) and among pre-specified patient subgroups. The model was well calibrated across the risk spectrum, although slightly overestimating risk in the highest risk patients. ConclusionsClinical acuity is a strong predictor of PCI procedural mortality. With inclusion of variables that further characterize clinical stability, the updated CathPCI Registry mortality models remain well-calibrated across the spectrum of PCI risk...|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} speculated and {{supported}} in data that the complete elimination of all waiting times is not ideal. When waiting lists arise through a prioritization process based on physician-determined medical <b>urgency</b> and the <b>procedure's</b> risk, (in contrast to patient's ability to pay or profitability for the physician), waiting lists can possibly help patients. It's been postulated that a system of immediate care can be detrimental for optimal patient outcomes, as unnecessary or unproven surgery might not be easily avoided if all patients are granted instant care. An example is the Canadian province of British Columbia, where, according to surgeon Dr. Lawrence Burr, 15 heart patients died in 1990 while {{on a waiting list}} for heart surgery. According to Robin Hutchinson, senior medical consultant to the Health Ministry's heart program, had the waiting list not existed and all patients given instant access to the surgery, the expected number of fatalities would have been 22 due to the operation mortality rate at that time. Hutchison noted that the BC Medical Association's media campaign did not make reference to these comparative statistics and focused on deaths during waiting for surgery. Since, ideally, waiting lists prioritize higher-risk patients to receive surgery ahead of those with lower risks, this helps reduce overall patient mortality. Consequently, a wealthy or highly insured patient in a system based on profit or ability to pay (as in the U.S.) may be pushed into surgery or other procedures more quickly, with a result in higher morbidity or mortality risk. This is in addition to the better-understood phenomenon in which lower-income, uninsured, or under-insured patients have their care denied or delayed, also resulting in worse health care.|$|R
30|$|Gossypibomas {{generally}} occur following abdominal and gynaecological surgery. Although {{the true}} incidence is unknown, {{it was reported}} as being 1 in 100 to 3, 000 for all surgical interventions and 1 in 1, 000 to 15, 000 for intraabdominal operations [3]. The surgical gauze {{is made out of}} cotton, which is rather inert and stimulates no specific biochemical reaction. When left in the body cavity, surgical sponges can create two types of foreign body reaction. The first type of response is exudative, with the resultant formation of an abscess with or without bacterial invasion. This reaction usually causes related clinical symptoms and signs shortly after surgery. The second type of response is aseptic with extensive adhesions and encapsulations resulting in a foreign body granuloma [4]. The septic complications are likely to present early during the postoperative period, whereas the aseptic encapsulations can disappear over a period of years, as in the case described here. The time between initial and repeated surgery varies from a few days to 20  years. Circumstances reported to explain operative loss of sponges are emergencies, <b>urgency</b> and haemorrhagic <b>procedures,</b> unexpected changes in the operation, time-consuming operations, large body habitus, and operations in anatomic regions that are difficult to reach [5]. The counting of packs used in long procedures, may also contribute, and additional counts are recommended when there are changes of the personnel in the operating theatre. The majority of the reported cases of gossypiboma occur when there is a normal pack count. The examination of the operative notes of the Caesarean and discussion with the original surgeon, in this case, did not indicate why or how a pack was retained. Probably, a pack was used during closing and then not documented in the final account. Gossypibomas are generally not suspected and remain an accidental peroperative or postoperative finding. Treatment consists of thorough surgical exploration of the abdomen, removal of the gossypiboma, and drainage of the purulent fluid.|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{relationship}} {{of the division of}} the diaphragm during thoracoabdominal aortic repair to prolonged ventilator support has not been studied. The {{purpose of this study was}} (1) to determine whether preservation of diaphragm integrity has a significant effect on postoperative ventilator duration and (2) to elucidate other pulmonary risk factors related to thoracoabdominal aortic surgery and to study the {{relationship of}} these factors to the intact diaphragm technique. Methods:Between February 1991 and January 1997, we repaired 397 descending and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. Descending thoracic aneurysms were not included in the study because their repair does not include the diaphragm. A total of 256 patients participated in this study. The diaphragm was divided in 150 patients and left intact in 106 patients. Examined as potential risk factors were patient demographics, history and physical findings, aneurysm extent, <b>urgency</b> of the <b>procedure,</b> acute dissection, cross-clamp time, homologous and autologous blood product consumption, and adjunctive operative techniques. FEV 1 also was considered in the 197 patients for whom preoperative spirometry was available. Prolonged mechanical ventilation was defined as ventilator support for > 72 hours. Data were analyzed by univariate contingency table and multiple logistic regression methods. Results: Increasing age (odds ratio [OR], 1. 02 /y; P <. 02), current smoking (OR, 2. 6; P <. 0008), total cross-clamp time (OR, 1. 0 /min; P <. 008), units packed red blood cells transfused (OR, 1. 06 /unit; P <. 008), and division of the diaphragm (OR, 2. 03; P <. 02) were significant, independent predictors of prolonged ventilation. Sixty-seven percent of patients (71 of 106) whose diaphragms were preserved were extubated in < 72 hours compared with 52 % of patients (78 of 150) who underwent diaphragm division (OR, 0. 53; P <. 02). Conclusion: Independently of well known pulmonary risk factors, an intact diaphragm during thoracoabdominal aortic repair results in a higher probability of early ventilator weaning.

Study population: All Danish patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer who are either diagnosed or treated in a surgical department of a public Danish hospital. Main variables: The database comprises an array of surgical, radiological, oncological, and pathological variables. The surgeons record data such as diagnostics performed, including type and results of radiological examinations, lifestyle factors, comorbidity and performance, treatment including the surgical <b>procedure,</b> <b>urgency</b> of surgery, and intra- and postoperative complications within 30 days after surgery. The pathologists record data such as tumor type, number of lymph nodes and metastatic lymph nodes, surgical margin status, and other pathological risk factors. Descriptive data: The database has had > 95 % completeness in including patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma with > 54, 000 patients registered so far with approximately one-third rectal cancers and two-third colon cancers and an overrepresentation of men among rectal cancer patients. The stage distribution has been more or less constant until 2014 with a tendency toward a lower rate of stage IV and higher rate of stage I after introduction of the national screening program in 2014. The 30 -day mortality rate after elective surgery has been reduced from > 7 % in 2001 – 2003 to < 2 % since 2013. Conclusion: The database is a national population-based clinical database with high patient and data completeness for the perioperative period. The resolution of data is high for description of the patient at the time of diagnosis, including comorbidities, and for characterizing diagnosis, surgical interventions, and short-term outcomes. The database does not have high-resolution oncological data and does not register recurrences after primary surgery. The Danish Colorectal Cancer Group provides high-quality data and has been documenting an increase in short- and long-term survivals since it started in 2001 for both patients with colon and rectal cancers.

40|$|In {{the years}} 1995 to 2001, 970 women with urinary {{incontinence}} underwent surgery with tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Falun Hospital. In 2002 the charts {{of all these}} women were reviewed and a questionnaire was sent in 2004. 760 women (78, 4 %) answered the questions. The mean time since surgery was 5. 7 years. The mean age at surgery was 58. 7 years. Of all patients, 580 had pure stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and 112 had mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) prior to surgery. Of the women with SUI, 85 % were subjectively and persistently cured. Of the women with MUI, 60 % were subjectively cured up to 3 years after the TVT operation.   However this figure declined to 30 % among women operated on 6 - 8 years previously. The increasing incontinence was due to urgency symptoms and urge urinary incontinence (UUI). The IIQ- 7 and UDI- 6 questionnaires were used for measuring quality of life. The women showed dramatic improvement after TVT surgery irrespective of time since surgery. Women with chronic diseases also had relative improvement in QOL scores. Sixty-seven of the women with pure SUI preoperatively (14. 5 %) reported persistent de novo urgency symptoms postoperatively and 51 of the women also had UUI. Old age, history of cesarean section, increasing parity and BMI were risk factors for developing de novo <b>urgency</b> after TVT <b>procedure.</b> Among women ≥ 75 years 55. 7 % reported cure after TVT, compared to 79. 7 % of women < 60 years. The overall cure rate in the very overweight women (BMI ≥ 35) was 52. 1 %, compared to 81. 2 % in women of normal weight (BMI < 25). Conclusions. The subjective results after TVT surgery for SUI are very good even after 8 years. Short-term effect of TVT on MUI is acceptable, but declines after 3 years. Improvements in measures of quality of life after TVT surgery are dramatic and persistent in both the SUI and MUI groups. Women who developed de novo urgency symptoms after TVT surgery reported poorer quality of life. The TVT procedure is simple and safe, but the results in the oldest or most overweight women are {{not as good as}} in the younger or normal weight women...|$|R
40|$|O presente estudo aborda o uso de luvas por parte dos enfermeiros durante a prestação de cuidados num {{hospital}} da Região Autónoma dos Açores. Estudo transversal e descritivo com abordagem quantitativa que objectivou caracterizar as práticas, verificar comportamentos, conferir o conhecimento e o entendimento da norma de boas práticas para o uso daquele equipamento de protecção individual. Como instrumento de colheita de dados, usou-se um questionário, aplicado a 311 enfermeiros. O estudo sugere que a predominância (93 %) dos enfermeiros usa frequentemente luvas de látex não estéreis, tendo como razões de uso a minimização do risco de manipulação de material biológico e diminuição do risco de transmissão de infecção profissional-utente e utente-profissional. Opinam (53 %) que se protegem adequadamente e estão informados (96 %) dos riscos decorrentes da sua actividade. Classificam (69 %) como risco elevado o facto de não usarem luvas e têm conhecimento (89 %) da existência de protocolos do uso de luvas no serviço. Discordam (69 %) que as condições de trabalho são deficientes, consideram (74 %) as luvas adequadas, disponíveis (97 %) e não desconfortáveis (80 %). A urgência no procedimento e o risco não percepcionado são os principais motivos apontados pelos enfermeiros que negligenciam o uso de luvas. Como pressupostos para o uso das luvas, a maioria (69 %) lava as mãos antes de as calçar, quase todos (99 %) colocam antes de iniciar os procedimentos, usam de forma individualizada (100 %), removem (100 %) correctamente e higienizam (96 %) as mãos logo após o seu uso. Nos cuidados de higiene aos genitais 93 % usam sempre luvas, assim como para a execução de pensos e para a punção venosa (65 %). A maioria (63 %) dos enfermeiros é pouco influenciada pelos colegas ou chefias para recorrerem ao uso de luvas. The study {{addresses the}} use of gloves by nurses whilst providing health care in a hospital in the autonomous region of the Azores. It is a cross-sectional, descriptive study with a quantitative approach, aimed at characterising practices, checking behaviour, and comparing their {{knowledge and understanding of}} the rules on best practice for {{the use of}} personal protective equipment. As a data collection instrument, a survey was carried out on 311 nurses. The study suggests that the majority (93 %) of nurses frequently use unsterilised latex gloves. The reason for the use of these gloves is to minimise the risks associated with the handling of biological materials and {{to reduce the risk of}} transmitting infection from the nurses to the patients and from the patients to the nurses. 53 % of the nurses believe that they protect themselves adequately, and 96 % consider that they are well informed of the risks associated with their work. 69 % consider that not using gloves is a high risk, and 89 % are aware of the existence of rules concerning the use of gloves at work. Some 79 % disagree that the working conditions are inadequate, 74 % consider the gloves adequate, 97 % report they are readily available and 80 % say that they are not uncomfortable. They recognise that the main reasons for gloves not being used, although necessary, are the <b>urgency</b> of the <b>procedure</b> and the lack of perception of the risk. As expected for the use of the gloves, the majority (69 %) washes their hands before putting them on and almost all nurses (99 %) put them on before starting any procedures. All nurses stated that they used a separate pair for each treatment and that they removed them correctly, while 96 % said that they sanitised their hands after use. When providing genital health care 93 % always use gloves, as well as when affixing plasters and for performing venipuncture (65 %). When it comes to the use of gloves, the majority of nurses (63 %) are influenced very little by their colleagues or superiors...|$|R
40|$|Hypothesis / aims {{of study}} The {{aim of this}} study was to prospectively {{evaluate}} the efficacy of the TVT-O inside-out procedure for the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Study design, materials and methods From March 2003 through September 2003, 53 patients with clinical evidence of SUI participated in this prospective clinical trial. Preoperative evaluation included complete history, physical examination, multichannel urodynamics, urine analysis, and cystoscopy. None of the patients presented the following exclusion criteria: post-void residual volume (PVR) ≥ 100 cc, detrusor overactivity or acontractility, contraindication to anesthesia, pregnancy, neurological pathology, or active urinary or vaginal infection. All patients met the following inclusion criteria: age > 25 and < 85 years, clinically demonstrated SUI, positive Ulmsten test, and maximum cystometric capacity ≥ 300 mL. In all patients, a sub-urethral tape (Gynecare®) was inserted by one single surgeon via an inside-out transobturator approach (TVT-O), as previously described (1). Evaluation of SUI, urgency/urge incontinence, daytime urinary frequency/nocturia, and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of bladder outlet obstruction/retention was carried out using the Measurement of Urinary Handicap scale questionnaire (2). The importance of urinary incontinence was assessed with a visual analog scale graded from 0 to 10. Quality of life (QoL) assessment was performed using the validated Ditrovie self-administered questionnaire. Outpatient follow-up was perfomed at 1 and 6 months, and every 6 months thereafter. Follow-up evaluation included physical examination with a stress test, uroflowmetry, PVR, and symptom, visual analog, and QoL scales scoring. Cure was defined as no leakage based on both symptom scale scoring and physical examination. Improvement was defined as at least a 50 % decrease in symptoms based on the questionnaire’s evaluation. Chart review was conducted by a physician not associated with the surgical procedure. The specific protocol used in this study was approved by the Medical Ethics committee of our Institution. All patients had given their written informed consent. Methods, defintions,and units conform to the standards recommended by the ICS. Results Mean age of the patients was 61. 2 years (36 to 80). Of the 53 patients, 20 had undergone previous pelvic surgery. Forty-eight patients suffered from SUI. Five patients did not complain of SUI but had clinical evidence of SUI after reduction of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) during vaginal examination. The TVT-O procedure was associated with POP cure (performed before TVT-O) in 12 patients. Maximal urethral closure pressure was < 30 cm H 20 in 6 patients. Follow-up time was ≥ 6 months in all women (max = 12. 5; mean = 8). A total of 33 and 20 women received spinal and general anesthesia, respectively. Intraoperative blood loss was < 100 cc in all cases. No vaginal wall, urethral, or bladder perforation was encountered. No hematoma, neurological complication, fistula, vaginal or urethral erosion, or tape rejection was observed. Some patients reported pain symptoms, directly after the procedure, mainly located in the thigh regions (either uni- or bilaterally). Pain was always mild, never requiring opioid antalgics. No patient complained of persistent pain; indeed, pain had completely vanished within the first post-operative month in all cases. At the latest follow-up visit, PVR was < 100 cc and max flow rate was ≥ 10 mL/sec in 49 (92. 4 %) and 39 (73. 6 %) patients, respectively. One patient underwent an immediate tape release procedure for complete retention 2 days after TVT-O. Thereafter, the patient had no PVR and was completely dry. The tape was sectioned in 2 patients for chronic retention and/or urgency associated with bladder outlet obstruction, 4 and 7 months after the operation. Based on the SUI questionnaire evaluation and physical examination, 50 (94. 3 %) patients were cured. SUI symptoms had improved in 1 patient and had not changed in another. One patient with POP not complaining of SUI preoperatively (but with clinically demonstrated SUI following POP reduction) developed SUI after POP cure associated with TVT-O. Analysis of the urgency questionnaire’s results revealed that among the 53 patients, 32 did not complain of any urgency before the operation. Of these 32 patients, 3 patients developed de novo urgency, with one of them requiring tape sectioning because of obstruction-associated urge incontinence. Among the 21 patients with preoperative urge symptoms, 15 of them reported disappearance of <b>urgency</b> after the <b>procedure.</b> Urge symptoms were unchanged in the remaining 6 patients. Daytime frequency/nocturia symptoms scale scoring showed that 4 patients had a worsening of these symptoms while all other patients were either improved or unchanged. LUTS suggestive of bladder outlet obstruction/retention appeared or worsened in 3 patients, amongst which the 2 patients who required tape sectioning. These symptoms were unchanged or decreased (mainly in patients with associated POP cure) in all other patients. Analysis of the urinary incontinence visual analog and QoL scale scores demonstrated that the majority of patients reported disappearance of urinary leakage together with significant improvement of their QoL (Figures 1 and 2). Interpretation of results As already suggested by the results of a recent feasibility study (1), TVT-O appears to be associated with a minimal risk of peri-operative complications. Indeed, in our present prospective study, no injury to the bladder, vagina, or urethra was encountered and we have not observed any vascular, digestive or neurological complication. Our data suggest that TVT-O is associated with high objective and subjective SUI cure rates and a low incidence of post-operative complications. Longer follow-up times are required to determine the long-term efficacy of TVT-O. 	 Concluding message The short term results of this prospective study suggest that TVT-O is a safe and efficient surgical procedure for the treatment of female SUI. References 1.
