5|$|Mineral {{resources}} {{near the}} top end of the canal included ironstone, which was normally extracted by scouring. This caused problems for the canal, as silt was deposited in the feeders and the top pounds. The Fox family, who were based at Neath Abbey, but who were scouring ironstone further up the valley, agreed to construct a new feeder in 1807 to mitigate the problem. Protests made to the Tappendens, who were scouring at Pen-rhiw and Cwm Gwrelych, were less successful. As the pounds were silting up, the company took legal action in 1811. The court found in their favour, recognising that the canal would soon be useless <b>unless</b> <b>something</b> was done.|$|E

25|$|At the 1945 annual league meeting, held on September 7, it {{was noted}} that the backers of the Maroons {{franchise}} were in discussion to sell to a group from Philadelphia fronted by Canadiens board member Len Peto. The league governors were prepared to approve the transfer, provided the Philadelphia group could prove they had the necessary funds for a hockey team. They also made sure to clarify that the Maroons franchise rights would expire in April 1947 <b>unless</b> <b>something</b> was done with them.|$|E
25|$|At {{that time}} that the Educational Funding Agency (EFA) queried AET's {{competence}} with financial planning, it had only used its powers to issue a Financial Warning on 8 occasions. In a later submission to a Parliamentary Select Committee, Ian Comfort, the CEO of AET queried {{the ability of the}} Education Funding Agency to continue working as it does, <b>unless</b> <b>something</b> changed. The DfE (and Dame Rachel de Souza, CEO of the Inspiration Trust) robustly rejected his criticisms saying that the EFA systems were efficient and suitable.|$|E
25|$|As player {{contract}} values soared, and {{the number}} of broadcasters, commentators, columnists, and sports writers also soared. The competition for a fresh angle on any story became fierce. Media pundits began questioning the high salaries that the players received. Coverage began to become intensely negative. Players personal lives, which had always been off-limits <b>unless</b> <b>something</b> extreme happened, became the fodder of editorials, insider stories on television, and features in magazines. When the use of performance-enhancing drugs became an issue, the gap between the sports media and the players whom they covered widened further.|$|E

25|$|Kuhn {{illustrates}} how {{a paradigm shift}} later became possible when Galileo Galilei introduced his new ideas concerning motion. Intuitively, when an object is set in motion, it soon comes to a halt. A well-made cart may travel a long distance before it stops, but <b>unless</b> <b>something</b> keeps pushing it, it will eventually stop moving. Aristotle had argued that this was presumably a fundamental property of nature: for the motion of an object to be sustained, it must continue to be pushed. Given the knowledge available at the time, this represented sensible, reasonable thinking.|$|E
25|$|A {{large body}} of Irish men engaged in {{constructing}} the Great Western Railway went to The Stag beerhouse, where a few Englishmen had assembled, and a row commenced. Hearing that the Rev. Dr. Walmisley, the rector, had dispatched a messenger to Brentford for the police, their rage was diverted to that worthy magistrate, whom they threatened to sacrifice to their fury. Three prisoners were sentenced to two months in the House of Correction by the magistrates, who {{sent a letter to}} the Company, and stated that <b>unless</b> <b>something</b> was done, it would be necessary to apply to the Government for a body of police or military, to be stationed at Hanwell.|$|E
25|$|A simpler system, {{developed}} later, uses a {{concave disc}} (or {{a pair of}} them) set at a large angle to the direction of progress, that uses the concave shape to hold the disc into the soil– <b>unless</b> <b>something</b> hard strikes the circumference of the disk, causing it to roll {{up and over the}} obstruction. As the arrangement is dragged forward, the sharp edge of the disc cuts the soil, and the concave surface of the rotating disc lifts and throws the soil to the side. It doesn't make as good a job as the mouldboard plough (but this is not considered a disadvantage, because it helps fight wind erosion), but it does lift and break up the soil (see disc harrow).|$|E

He offers a prize to whoever can make it to a gallows and tie a band around a hanged man's ankle. Each {{challenger}} is thwarted by demons and runs back to the king's hall in fear. However, Nera succeeds, and the dead man then asks for a drink. Nera carries him {{on his back and}} they stop at three houses. They enter the third, where the dead man drinks and spits it on the householders, killing them. Returning, Nera sees a fairy host burning the king's hall and slaughtering those inside. He follows the host through a portal into the Otherworld. Nera learns that what he saw was only a vision of what will happen the next Samhain <b>unless</b> <b>something</b> is done. He is able to return to the hall and warns the king.|$|E
500|$|The smog is {{commonly}} cited {{as one of}} the most-visible and most-discussed environmental disasters of the 1960s in the United States, alongside the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill and the 1969 Cuyahoga River fire. National public awareness of the smog and its health effects spurred the nascent environmental movement in the United States and galvanized support for legislation to regulate air pollution. Vernon McKenzie, chief of the air pollution division of the federal Public Health Service, called the smog [...] "a warning of what can happen — and will happen — with increasing frequency and in wider areas <b>unless</b> <b>something</b> is done to prevent it." [...] In the 1968 book Killer Smog, William Wise warned that the 1966 smog and the 1952 London smog represented a vulnerability to air pollution disasters among American cities: ...|$|E
500|$|Rowell {{refused to}} give General Douglas MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) in Brisbane a [...] "ball to ball" [...] {{description}} of the action, sending only factual information at stated times. Failure to keep GHQ up to date could only lead to fears of the worst, which were confirmed when Major General George Kenney reported that in his opinion Port Moresby would soon fall <b>unless</b> <b>something</b> drastic was done, and Rowell was [...] "defeatist". On 17 September, the General MacArthur discussed the situation in New Guinea with Prime Minister John Curtin on the secraphone. He pointed out that while the Japanese faced all the same difficulties as the Australian troops fighting on the Kokoda Track, the Japanese were advancing and the Australians were retreating, and the whole situation seemed to MacArthur {{to be a lot}} like the Malaya. He recommended that General Blamey be sent up to New Guinea to take personal command of the situation.|$|E

500|$|According to Tripp, sexual {{attraction}} is encouraged by [...] "tension and distance" [...] between {{one person and}} another, and is consequently [...] "seldom aroused and never rewarding <b>unless</b> <b>something</b> in the partner or in the situation itself is viewed as resistant to it." [...] Tripp maintains that societies have increased divisions {{between men and women}} partly to satisfy needs inherent in sexual psychology. He suggests that there are often elements of truth to traditional accusations made against women, such as deviousness, and that derogatory descriptions of women serve to increase divisions between the sexes, create tension between them, and make relations between men and women more exciting. Tripp proposes that social bonds between men are not prone to becoming sexual because the similarity and camaraderie between men make them too close to each other for homosexual activities to have any interest. Tripp maintains that heterosexuality and homosexuality generally develop in parallel ways, but that since homosexuality, unlike heterosexuality, is not encouraged and institutionalized by society, its origins are more [...] "scattered and diverse." [...] He reviewed anthropological evidence on homosexuality.|$|E
500|$|The clip portrays {{sexual assaults}} mostly against women, {{and how they}} cope after the incident. The {{black-and-white}} video opens with a warning message: [...] "The following contains graphic content that may be emotionally unsettling but reflects {{the reality of what}} is happening daily on college campuses." [...] It then shows a girl walking through an empty corridor, followed by young people in various activities in a college campus: reading (portrayed by actress Nikki Reed), a trans man adjusting his chest binder in the bathroom, attending a party (one of the partygoers being portrayed by actress Kiersey Clemons). However they are all sexually assaulted, with one of the scenes showing a couple of young girls being drugged and raped at the party. The heartbroken girls and the trans man cry, while alternate images show them expressing their emotions by inscribing words on themselves. Ultimately they find solace and hope in friendship, and leave the college with their friends, as the words inscribed on their bodies change to positive messages. Near its ending, the music video displays the message: [...] "One in five college women will be sexually assaulted this year <b>unless</b> <b>something</b> changes", following which the message points the audience to the Facebook page for The Hunting Ground and Itsonus.org, the White House support website for people who have endured a sexual crime. A portion of the earnings from the song's digital sales will be donated to organizations supporting victims of sexual assault.|$|E
500|$|A pun, the character's name [...] "Kim Possible" [...] {{alludes to}} the word [...] "impossible". Kim is {{referred}} to by several nicknames by various characters throughout the series, including K.P. (Ron); Kimmy Cub (James); K, Miss Perfect, Tin Teeth (Bonnie); Princess, Pumpkin, Cupcake, Miss Snooty, Miss Priss (Shego); and Kimmie by miscellaneous. Unlike traditional superheroes and secret agents, Kim lacks a secret identity; the character is known simply as [...] "Kim Possible, and everyone who knows her knows what she does." [...] Kadeen Griffiths of Bustle observed that Kim [...] "never put on spandex or acquired a secret identity; instead, {{she had her own}} website where people could book her for jobs with a tagline that promised that she could do anything", a claim reinforced by {{the fact that she is}} capable of fighting crime while continuing to perform well in high school and remaining captain of her school's cheerleading squad. Writing for Women Write About Comics, Jamie Kingston observed that Middleton High School [...] "ignores her as a heroine <b>unless</b> <b>something</b> happens on school grounds where she has to do her thing." [...] Thus, Kim rarely receives attention for her work from her family and peers, although her customers remain grateful. However, while describing Kim as a [...] "power fantasy", Stealing Commas believes that Kim is simply [...] "preventing regime change" [...] and [...] "Preserving the status quo rather than doing any real world saving." [...] According to Metacritic, Kim [...] "is stubborn, strong-willed, and has a fuse shorter than a grenade with a three second delay" [...] but remains [...] "extremely humble, refusing to take credit for her truly amazing actions." [...] Meanwhile, David Horiuchi of Amazon.com wrote that the character is [...] "tough, witty, and refreshingly free of any saucy teen attitude." ...|$|E
