25|$|For example, an {{intriguing}} problem in geobiology {{is the role}} of organisms in the global cycling of methane. Genetics has revealed that the methane monooxygenase gene (pmo) is used for oxidizing methane and is present in all aerobic methane-oxidizers, or methanotrophs. The presence of DNA sequences of the pmo gene in the environment {{can be used as a}} proxy for methanotrophy. A more generalizable tool is the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, which is found in bacteria and archaea. This gene evolves very slowly over time and is not usually horizontally transferred, and so it is often used to distinguish different taxonomic units of organisms in the environment. In this way, genes are clues to organismal metabolism and identity. Genetics enables <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> 'who is there?' and 'what are they doing?' This approach is called metagenomics.|$|E

Drawing the rules in different Wolfram classes in these slices of the rule space show that class 1 rules tend to have lower number of bit-1's, thus located in one region of the space, whereas class 3 rules tend to have higher proportion (50%) of bit-1's.|$|E

Critic Glenn Kenny said that he [...] "saw a movie that subverted a lot of expectations concerning viewer identification and empathy" [...] and that [...] "rather than endorsing the barbarity, the picture makes the viewer in a sense complicit with it", which is [...] " [...] whole other can of worms". Writer Andrew Sullivan said, [...] "the movie is not an apology for torture, as so many have said, and as I have worried about. It is an exposure of torture. It removes any doubt that war criminals ran this country for seven years". Filmmaker Michael Moore similarly said, [...] "I left the movie thinking it made an incredible statement against torture", and noted that the film showed the abject brutality of torture. Critic Andrew O'Hehir said that the filmmaker's position on torture in the film is ambiguous, and creative choices were made and the film poses [...] "excellent questions for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> ourselves, arguably defining questions of the age, and I think the longer {{you look at them}} the thornier they get".|$|E

2500|$|The Isthmus of Tehuantepec is {{bounded by}} a {{northern}} and a southern coast, whereas the [...] "narrow neck" [...] {{described in the}} Book of Mormon {{is said to be}} surrounded by a west sea and an east sea (...) [...] Sorenson suggests that this is explained by understanding the manner in which ancient cultures label directions. He points out that the Israelites in Palestine defined their directions as though they were standing with their backs to the sea. The direction [...] "sea" [...] (seaward) denoted west while the direction [...] "fore" [...] (inland) denoted east. The direction south was denoted by [...] "right hand" [...] and the direction north by [...] "left hand." [...] In the case of Palestine, these directions correlated with the actual geography of the north-south coast [...] In the language used by the Maya, the word south meant [...] "on the right hand" [...] and north meant [...] "on the left" [...] One researcher suggested that ancient Maya directions were set 45 degrees different from our own. The Book of Mormon, however, leads <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> how a colony of ancient Israelites would have coordinated directions outside Palestine. [...] It {{is important to note that}} Hebraic scholars disagree with Sorenson's generalized interpretation of Israelite coordinates. [...] Sorenson is correct in pointing out that the expression [...] "seaward" [...] in Palestine commonly means west. [...] "Sea" [...] or [...] "seaward" [...] in Hebrew can substitute for [...] "west" [...] when referring to the local Mediterranean Sea. Yehoshua (Joshua) 1:4 reads, [...] "…as far as the great sea [...] toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border." [...] However, Sorenson is incorrect in suggesting that Israelites outside of Palestine would have generally defined west standing with their backs to a sea. The Israelite coordinate system is based on the perceived movement of the heavenly quarters. [...] East is therefore defined not by facing inland from an arbitrary coast, but by standing before the general direction of the rising sun. (מִזְרָח, Shemot (Exodus) 27:13, Devarim (Deuteronomy) 3:27, Yehoshua (Joshua) 11:3, Tehillim (Psalms) 113:3) [...] Facing sunrise, [...] "before" [...] is the same as east, the [...] "right hand" [...] directs south, the [...] "left hand" [...] directs north and [...] "behind" [...] becomes west. (Yehoshua (Joshua) 12:3, Yo'el (Joel) 2:20) [...] "Place of sunset" [...] (מַעֲרָב) properly defines Israelite west outside of Palestine. (Tehillim (Psalms) 103:12, Yesha'yahu (Isaiah) 43:5) [...] There is in fact an instance in Hebrew scripture in which [...] "from the sea" [...] may be translated [...] "from the south", possibly referring to the Arabian Sea.

RESULTS: We noted diffuse pain in the right hypochondrium, persisting 2 to 6 years after treatment (3. 7 % of persons), and weight loss appearing during treatment and persisting afterwards (2. 1 %). CONCLUSIONS: Our current state of knowledge leads <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>asking</b> whether pain in the right hypochondrium and weight loss would not {{be due to the}} presence of persistent hepatic lesions following fasciolosis treatment.
