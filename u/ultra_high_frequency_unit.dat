In {{order to}} ensure power supply {{reliability}} and reduce a variety of power supply failure, we analyze the development status, {{advantages and disadvantages of}} partial discharge detection techniques about the various Gas-insulated Metal-enclosed Swith Gear (GIS). We put forward the application of <b>ultra</b> <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> (UHF) technology for GIS partial discharge online monitoring technology methods to solve the problems of the difference of the pulse current method of anti-interference ability and ultrasonic sensitivity the problem of low. According to the deficiency of the traditional <b>ultra</b> <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> sensor, we developed a new window type of <b>ultra</b> <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> sensor, and compared with conventional in vitro type UHF sensor. Experimental results show that that the window-type UHF sensor sensitivity and anti-jamming capability are superior to conventional high-frequency sensor...|$|R

40|$|A {{design of}} dual {{broadband}} antenna is proposed in this paper; {{it consists of}} one low <b>frequency</b> <b>unit</b> and two <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>units.</b> The low <b>frequency</b> <b>unit</b> consists {{of a pair of}} printing vibrators; the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>unit</b> consists of a pair of printing oscillators, which is bent at its end, and <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>unit</b> and low <b>frequency</b> <b>unit</b> are set on the same dielectric substrate. Through adding a parasitic unit on antenna, it can enhance frequency bandwidth without affecting the bandwidth. In the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>unit,</b> it adopts gap-coupled microstrip line feeding method in order to get enough bandwidth. Through the test of dual broadband antenna, it can be found that, in the low frequency part, the antenna covers 20 % bandwidth of the total bandwidth, and it covers the frequency from 800 [*]MHz to 980 [*]MHz. In the <b>high</b> <b>frequency,</b> the antenna covers 60 % of total bandwidth and its frequency is from 1540 [*]MHz to 2860 [*]MHz, so the designed antenna can satisfy the frequency requirements of 2 G/ 3 G/LTE (4 G) communication system...|$|R
