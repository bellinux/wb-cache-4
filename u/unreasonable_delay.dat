He overturned the decision below because while the delay between the speeding incident and the day the case went to trial was exactly 18 months, the ticket was issued eight days after the speeding incident and the trial was therefore held within the 18-month limit.|$|E
25|$|The {{positive}} factors {{considered in}} recommending an award’s percentage include {{the significance of}} the whistleblower information, assistance and cooperation from the whistleblower in the investigation and proceedings, any law enforcement interest advanced by a potentially higher award, and whether the whistleblower cooperated with the company’s internal compliance system in connection with the matter. The negative factors considered include the whistleblower’s culpability, an <b>unreasonable</b> <b>delay</b> in reporting wrongdoing, and the whistleblower’s interference with the company’s internal compliance system. Though Office of the Whistleblower considers both these positive and negative factors, the office has discretion in making award recommendations.|$|E
25|$|No {{person may}} be {{detained}} for enquiries for more than 24 hours unless such detention is authorized by a police officer of or above the rank of assistant superintendent, or for 48 hours in all. Such a police officer may, if satisfied that the enquiries cannot be completed within 48 hours, authorize the further detention of the person for an additional period not exceeding 14 days. In contrast, under Article 9(3) of the Constitution of Singapore, {{a person who is}} arrested must be informed as soon as may be of the grounds of his arrest and be allowed to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice. In addition, Article 9(4) states that he must without <b>unreasonable</b> <b>delay,</b> and in any case within 48 hours (excluding the time of any necessary journey), be produced before a magistrate and shall not be further detained in custody without the magistrate's authority. However, the Constitution specifically provides that no law inconsistent with those provisions which was in force before the commencement of the Constitution and which authorizes the arrest and detention of any person in the interests of public safety, peace and good order is invalidated by these Articles. No illegality in the detention by the police renders a detention order made subsequently by the Minister unlawful.|$|E

2500|$|Where an arrested {{individual}} {{does not}} receive a probable cause determination within 48 hours, the calculus changes. In such a case, the arrested individual does not {{bear the burden of}} proving an <b>unreasonable</b> <b>delay.</b> Rather, the burden shifts to the government to demonstrate the existence of a bona fide emergency or other extraordinary circumstance. The fact that in a particular case it may take longer than 48 hours to consolidate pretrial proceedings does not qualify as an extraordinary circumstance.

5000|$|Many {{immigration}} {{advocacy groups}} {{maintain that the}} use of the FBI Name Check process by USCIS is unproductive and even counter-productive in accomplishing the stated national security goals of the USCIS policy {{while at the same time}} causing <b>unreasonable</b> <b>delays</b> for large numbers of applicants. Most people affected by FBI Name Check delays are already authorized to work and stay in the United States while their applications are pending. Critics assert that the current USCIS policy does not result in identifying and detaining genuinely dangerous individuals quickly but rather allows them to legally remain in the United States essentially indefinitely, while at the same time causing <b>unreasonable</b> <b>delays</b> in the processing of applications of tens of thousands law-abiding applicants. This view is also expressed in a number of court decisions related to the FBI Name Check delays. Thus in a 2008 ruling in a lawsuit by a Romanian naturalization applicant, U.S. District Judge Michael M. Baylson wrote: [...] "If these individuals are potentially dangerous to the United States, it would seem their applications should be expedited over all other work. ... Some plaintiffs in these cases have been waiting over three years for a decision...Delaying their citizenship status does not eliminate the danger they may pose to the United States. ... It would seem that this group, estimated at 1 percent of all applicants, should be investigated more quickly, not more slowly, than everyone else." ...|$|R

2500|$|Later, in R. v. Finta (1994), the Supreme Court {{clarified}} {{that the}} period of [...] "unreasonable delay" [...] begins {{at the time the}} charge is laid. [...] This was in response to a case in which charges were laid 45 years after the alleged offences occurred; and that this was suggested to be an <b>unreasonable</b> <b>delay.</b> [...] Reasonableness depends, in part, on the amount of investigative work that is involved, the number of interested parties and their locations, and/or the complexity of the case. Reasonableness also relates to local court resources and/or how they compare to other jurisdictions. Other elements in determining reasonableness of delay could include delays by either the Crown attorney or defense counsel, or even the Court itself.|$|E
2500|$|... "This {{is not to}} {{say that}} the {{probable}} cause determination in a particular case passes constitutional muster simply because it is provided within 48 hours. Such a hearing may nonetheless violate Gerstein if the arrested individual can prove that his or her probable cause determination was delayed unreasonably. Examples of <b>unreasonable</b> <b>delay</b> are delays for the purpose of gathering additional evidence to justify the arrest, a delay motivated by ill will against the arrested individual, or delay for delay's sake. In evaluating whether the delay in a particular case is unreasonable, however, courts must allow a substantial degree of flexibility. Courts cannot ignore the often unavoidable delays in transporting arrested persons from one facility to another, handling late-night bookings where no magistrate is readily available, obtaining the presence of an arresting officer who may be busy processing other suspects or securing the premises of an arrest, and other practical realities.|$|E

60|$|The April morning, however, when I first {{carried out}} my {{sensitized}} surfaces for the impression which I hoped to receive {{from a certain}} historic spectacle was very different. There was even a suggestion of comfort in the archaic bear-skins; they were worn, {{and they had been}} worn, every day for nearly two hundred years, as part of the ceremonial of changing the regimental colors before Buckingham Palace. I will not be asked why this is imperative; it has always been done and probably always will be done, and to most civilian onlookers will remain as unintelligible in detail as it was to me. When the regiment was drawn up under the palace windows, a part detached itself from the main body and went off to a gate of the palace, and continued mysteriously stationary there. In the mean time the ranks left behind closed or separated amid the shouting of sergeants or corporals, and the men relieved themselves of the strain from their knapsacks, or satisfied an exacting military ideal, by hopping at will into the air and bouncing their knapsacks, dragging lower down, up to the napes of their necks, where they rested under the very fringe of their bear-skin caps. A couple of officers, with swords drawn, walked up and down behind the ranks, but, though they were tall, fine fellows, and expressed in the nonchalant fulfilment of their part a high sense of boredom, they did not give the scene any such poignant interest as it had from the men in performing a duty, or indulging a privilege, by hopping into the air and bouncing their knapsacks up to their necks. After what seemed an <b>unreasonable</b> <b>delay,</b> but was doubtless requisite for the transaction, the detachment sent for the change of colors returned with the proper standards. The historic rite was then completed, the troops formed in order, and marched back to their barracks to the exultant strains of their band.|$|E
60|$|The {{effect of}} this futile {{interview}} upon Lady Harman was remarkable. She took to herself an absurd conviction that this inconclusiveness had been an achievement. Confronted by a dilemma, she had chosen neither horn and assumed an attitude of inoffensive defiance. Springs in England vary greatly in their character; some are easterly and quarrelsome, some are north-westerly and wetly disastrous, a bleak invasion from the ocean; some are but the broken beginnings of what {{are not so much}} years as stretches of meteorological indecision. This particular spring was essentially a south-westerly spring, good and friendly, showery but in the lightest way and so softly reassuring as to be gently hilarious. It was a spring to get into the blood of anyone; it gave Lady Harman the feeling that Mrs. Pembrose would certainly be dealt with properly and without <b>unreasonable</b> <b>delay</b> by Heaven, and that meanwhile it was well to take the good things of existence as cheerfully as possible. The good things she took were very innocent things. Feeling unusually well and enjoying great draughts of spring air and sunshine were the chief. And she took them only for three brief days. She carried the children down to Black Strand to see her daffodils, and her daffodils surpassed expectation. There was a delirium of blackthorn in the new wild garden she had annexed from the woods and a close carpet of encouraged wild primroses. Even the Putney garden was full of happy surprises. The afternoon following her visit to Black Strand was so warm that she had tea with her family in great gaiety on the lawn under the cedar. Her offspring were unusually sweet that day, they had new blue cotton sunbonnets, and Baby and Annette at least succeeded in being pretty. And Millicent, under the new Swiss governess, had acquired, it seemed quite suddenly, a glib colloquial French that somehow reconciled one to the extreme thinness and shapelessness of her legs.|$|E

50|$|Each {{of the six}} {{special waste}} {{categories}} {{was the subject of}} separate EPA study. In July 1988, the EPA finished its study of oil, gas, and geothermal production wastes, in which it concluded that they did not warrant regulation under RCRA Subtitle C, but noted that they would continue to be regulated under Subtitle D (solid waste disposal). The EPA’s decision was based on its determinations that oil, gas, and geothermal production was already regulated by the states, that Subtitle C did not have the regulatory flexibility to deal effectively with the wastes, and that the permitting requirements of Subtitle C would impose <b>unreasonable</b> <b>delays</b> on oil, gas, and geothermal extraction. However, the EPA report identified regulatory gaps for oil and gas wastes, for which it recommended additional rules under existing EPA regulatory authority, under RCRA Subtitle D, the Clean Water Act, and the Safe Water Drinking Act.|$|R

40|$|Estate {{administration}} {{is the process}} by which the affairs of a decedent are settled.

This Note evaluates limited-scope representation, with a focus on whether it works, by examining the Attorney for Short Calendar program (“ASC”), a program run by the Mortgage Foreclosure Litigation Clinic at Yale Law School. ASC clients are homeowners defending against foreclosure; ASC volunteers (law students, faculty, and attorneys from the Connecticut Fair Housing Center) advise them and represent them in court for that day’s motions. To measure the efficacy of ASC, I compared outcomes for ASC clients and pro se homeowners—both that day’s orders and the eventual resolution of each case. I studied case files for more than a thousand foreclosure-related interactions from October 2015 through January 2017, including all such interactions in New Haven Superior Court at which a defendant appeared pro se or with limited-scope counsel, and I conclude that limited-scope representation at ASC was effective...|$|R
