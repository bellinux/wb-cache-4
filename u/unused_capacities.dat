The conventional capacity measures do not include the value of the equipment in the production system and so their application can lead to erroneous operations management decisions.

Flexible manufacturing systems (FMS), where the machining methods, machine tools, handling equipment, control systems and computer systems are used in an integrated way, become rather complex. Under these circum-stances the process of production planning turns into amore complicated one, and as a consequence of the high value of the resources the drive for decreased cost of unused capacity is significant.

40|$|Any QoS scheme must be {{designed}} {{from the perspective}} of pricing policies and service level agreements (SLAs). Although there has been enormous amount of research in designing mechanisms for delivering QoS, its applications has been limited due to the missing link between QoS, SLA and pricing. Therefore the pricing policies in practice are very simplistic (fixed price per unit capacity with fixed capacity allocation or pricing based on peak or 95 -percentile load etc.). The corresponding SLAs also provide very limited QoS options. This leads to provisioning based on peak load, under-utilization of resources and high costs. In this paper we present a SLA based framework for QoS provisioning and dynamic capacity allocation. The proposed SLA allows users to buy a long term capacity at a pre-specified price. However, the user may dynamically change the capacity allocation based on the instantaneous demand. We propose a three tier pricing model with penalties (TTPP) SLA that gives incentives to the users to relinquish <b>unused</b> <b>capacities</b> and acquire more capacity as needed. This work may be viewed as a pragmatic first step towards a more dynamic pricing scenario. We solve the admission control problem arising in this scheme using the concept of trunk reservation. We also show how the SLA can be used in virtual leased-line service for VPNs, and web hosting service by application service providers (ASPs). Using web traces we demonstrate the proposed SLA can lead to more efficient usage of network capacity by a factor of 1. 5 to 2.

40|$|The article {{intend to}} prove that the {{traditional}} methods of cost calculation do not correspond anymore to the actual principles imposed by the global economical competition which is focused more likely on the structure expenses, the conception period, the information sources and the value. The ABC method, the most popularized of all administration methods, presents the advantage of identifying the places where is found the origin of the waste, which are the activities with a low added value, where are located the <b>unused</b> <b>capacities</b> and how the costs are constituted. Adapted to the requirements of the Romanian economy, the ABC method can be applied in two stages, which are presented in the paper. There were identified the activities, the processes and the products and inside them, we proceeded to the modeling of the cost behavior, modeling which includes the EAD and APD concepts. The peculiarity of the method applied in the Romanian enterprise is that through the processing information, there can be determined the production cost for every line production, every activity, every floor, on the time unit (minute or hour) and on the product, as it is mentioned. By studying the specialty literature, we noticed some opinions regarding the possibility of integrating the ABC method with EVA, an aspect which is not possible, for now, to be applied to the studied enterprise. EVA remains an indicator for presenting financial performances through a new perspective, being useful especially for firms that perceive the capital as a source of funds without any costs and where the financial results are measured just through some profit indicators. The conclusion is that the utility of the method in taking strategic decisions regarding the selling cost and the best fabrication quantities remains uncertain because there can not be attached the principles of determining the breakeven point or the marginal contribution as long as the method does not allow the grouping of fixed and variable expenses. The solution could consist on developing a mixed alternative method which takes into consideration the activities behavior through which could be identified the cost of some specific activities that can allow determining the profitability of each product. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} years, urban {{stormwater}} discharges have been recognised {{as one of}} the main causes of the environmental problems of receiving water bodies. During rain events, in fact, large amounts of water and pollutants are directly discharged through combined sewer overflow (CSO) devices into the receiving waters without any treatment. In addition, storm flow peaks and pollutant shock loads can arrive at the treatment plant (TP) reducing its efficiency or causing malfunctionings. Recently, environmental problems have induced researchers to focus on the qualitative impacts of the CSO discharges. In particular, more efficient CSO devices, such as the high crested side-weir with bottom orifice and many kinds of vortex separator devices, have been proposed by different authors. These devices can perform a relevant reduction of the discharged pollutant loads, besides the usual flow partition function. A further significant improvement of the performances of CSO devices can be obtained by increasing as much as possible the storage capacity of the sewer system. For this objective, the real time control (RTC) has been proven to be a cost-effective solution since {{it is based on the}} activation of existing <b>unused</b> <b>capacities</b> and consequently allows for reducing the need of new storage infrastructures. Schilling reports significant monetary savings achieved by the implementation of RTC for several case studies. Benefits obtained with the implementation of RTC have been shown by different authors by comparing the performances of various urban drainage systems in RTC scenarios and in uncontrolled system scenarios. One common RTC technique is to activate the sewer in-line storage capacity by placing moveable regulators, such as sluice gates, weirs and orifices, into the main trunk sewers. These regulators, if adequately controlled, can reduce the CSO discharges in terms of both water volumes and pollutant masses and can perform also a better regulation of the flows conveyed to the TP. In this paper, the improvement of the performances of a CSO device deriving from the adoption of RTC techniques is analysed in terms of reduction of discharged water volumes and pollutants. In particular, a simple quality-oriented CSO device, the high crested side-weir with bottom orifice, has been considered. This device is made up of a high crested side weir and of a downstream fixed gate with bottom orifice and allows for storing some in-line volume behind the gate until the water level rises up over the weir crest. The storing process leads to reduce the discharge of first flush waters and of pollutants into the receiving water body and to increase the water volumes conveyed to the treatment plant. Benefits obtained with RTC techniques have been evaluated considering moveable sluice gate regulators placed upstream of the CSO device. The control of the gates has been performed adopting a basic local strategy aiming to the activation of the maximum in-line storage. In particular, standard proportional (P) control units have been considered for the regulation of the gate movements. The analysis has been carried out setting up and applying a numerical model to the experimental data of two Italian urban catchments, considering both quantitative and qualitative measurements recorded during several rain events. The implemented model is based on the fully-dynamic De Saint Venant equations for the water flow and on the advection-dispersion equation for the analysis of the pollutants inside the sewer system...|$|E
40|$|Growth and {{employment}} {{the scope of}} an European initiative Jacques Drèze, Edmond Malinvaud et Alii Executive Summary 1. Since almost twenty years now, European unemployment is a major social problem and the sign of significant underutilisation of resources {{at a time of}} substantial unfilled needs. Whereas employment increased by nearly 6 % between 1987 and 1990 in EC 12, the rate of employment is now again exceeding 10 % and rising. Even under reasonably optimistic forecasts (a growth rate of 2. 5 to 3 %), the unemployment rate will remain above 10 % for at least four or five years. This position paper reviews the short-, medium- and long-run policies best susceptible of promoting growth {{and employment}} in Europe. 2. We argue that fiscal policy is not, at this time, a suitable instrument of short-run stabilisation. Attention should rather be focussed on medium-term structural budget consolidation, which was neglected during the expansion of the late eighties. On the other hand, we argue for monetary stimulation through a strong decrease of short-term interest rates, and propose the reference level of zero short-term real interest rates. 3. Turning to medium-run policies, we advocate two sets of measures, concerning respectively labour costs and investment. 3. a We note that high unemployment is heavily concentrated among unskilled workers. Moreover, we find evidence of a trend in the skilll composition of labour demand, which contains a declining proportion of unskilled jobs. These considerations justify investment in training and education. We believe that they also justify immediate measures aimed at reducing the cost of unskilled labour relative to the cost of skilled labour and of capital. An important element of labour costs consists in taxes and social insurance contributions, which drive a substantial wedge — 30 to 50 % in the EC member countries — between the cost of labour to employers on the one hand, take-home pay or the social opportunity cost of unskilled labour on the other hand. We argue {{that the time has come}} to reduce that wedge, and we propose exempting minimum wages from employers' contributions to social security. This may be done either by collecting such contributions only on that part of all wages that exceeds minimum wages; or by introducing an exemption amounting to 100 % of these contributions at the minimum wage level but decreasing linearly to zero at twice that level. The first measure is very costly — of the order of 3. 2 % of GDP on average in EC 12, with substantial country differences. The second measure is much less costly, rather like 1. 2 % of GDP. In either case, substitute resources should be allocated to the social security. The CO 2 tax currently under consideration by EC countries (with estimated receipts of the order of 1 to 1. 3 % of GDP) is a natural source. Raising the ceiling on VAT rates is another source. There is room for country- specific measures. Econometric simulations of labour tax exemptions in France and Belgium must be regarded as imprecise. Generally, they confirm our belief that no miracle should be hoped for, but that appreciable medium-term gains in employment are in sight, at no budgetary cost, if our proposal is implemented on a bold scale. 3. b With regard to investment, we recognise that <b>unused</b> <b>capacities</b> limit the immediate prospects for business investment. But we argue that idle resources could be mobilised towards labour-intensive investments with adequate social returns — contributing in addition to sustain aggregate demand. This is also the logic of the Edinburgh initiative, where Trans-European Neworks receive priority, together with small firms. We argue however that the Edinburgh package falls short of what is needed. An investment program matching the structural budget consolidations to come would place no strain on capital markets, while making up the shortfall in public investments of the past decade. We advance a figure of 250 Bilion ECU'S (or roughly 8 times the Edinburgh objective) as a realistic medium-term target, and propose to privilege in addition areas like low-income housing, urban renewal and urban transportation. In order to stimulate such targeted investments, we suggest to rely mainly on employment subsidies, proportional to the labour content of approved projects. This would reinforce, or possibly anticipate, our previous suggestion for reducing labour costs — while enlarging the set of investments attractive to private investors and local authorities [...] . Improved access to capital markets should in addition be sought through collaboration with institutional intermediaries, through an extension of the mission of the European Investment Bank and through an extension or replication of the European Investment Fund. 4. Our discussion of structural problems is foccused on basic principles. We first stress the detrimental incidence of the prevailing uncertainty about some inflation, interest and exchange rates, but also about institutional developments in the monetary area — including the recurring temptations of competitive devaluations. We do not opt for a specific political program. But we stress that reducing institutional monetary uncertainties is an important goal in its own rights. It should be pursued actively, to put monetary Europe on a track more promising for employment than a return to floating exchange rates between the currencies of relatively small economies closely integrated through trade. We next turn to public finance and the Welfare State, recognising the need in several countries for structural budget consolidation, and the elements of disenchantment with respect to the performance of the Welfare State. Reviewing its economic logic, we conclude that the agenda should be to make the Welfare State leaner and more efficient, not to dismantle it. This calls for reviewing in depth the operating and distributive efficiency of existing programs, with the conflicting aims of reducing the share of social transfers in GDP by several percentage points, while strengthening the protection of the least endowed. Economists should intensify their participation in this important research challenge. Finally, we draw the implication for wages of an European Growth Initiative aimed at a period of sustained growth, with priority given to employment relative to real wages. We feel that a realistic pattern combines output growth in excess of 3 % with employment growth above 1 %. This leaves a margin of at most 2 % for real wages. Given the presence of wage drift, this seems to call for negotiated settlements at roughly constant real wages. Is such a pattern realistic ? We bring out the controversial issue of the significance for wage developments of the relative tax burdens on capital and labour. And we recognise that the decline of the labour share in the eighties has been accompanied by a rise in the share of interest income, which in many cases is subject to little taxation, due in particular to capital mobility and intercountry tax competition. A uniform withholding tax on interest income at the European level is the only avenue to correct that imbalance. Whether or not such a tax is desirable in its own rights is a debated issue. That debate should be enlarged to recognise that distributional fairness in the tax treatment of capital and labour could make a significant contribution to wage moderation — even though it may be premature to regard the empirical evidence as conclusive. 5. We hope to have identified a set of measures endowed with overall consistency and with a globality commensurate with the magnitude of the problem confronting us. They have budgetary implications that call for reallocating a few percentage points of GDP, which is more than usually contemplated. And they fall under the responsibility of a whole set of institutions which are not engaged in systematic policy coordination. Serious problems of implementation should thus be tackled. We call on policy makers to exert boldness and determination in tackling these problems. And we call on academic economists to participate actively in the definition and promotion of an ambitious European initiative — starting perhaps with a criticism and elaboration of our own views. Depuis bientôt vingt ans, le chômage européen est un problème social majeur et le signe d'une importante sous-utilisation des ressources à une époque où existent bien des besoins insatisfaits. Alors que l'emploi a crû de près de 6 % entre 1987 et 1990 dans la Communauté Européenne des douze, le taux de chômage dépasse à nouveau 10 % et s'élève. Même selon des prévisions raisonnablement optimistes (un taux de croissance de 2, 5 à 3 %) le taux de chômage dépassera 10 % durant au moins quatre ou cinq ans. Cette note prend position sur les politiques de court, moyen et long terme que nous considérons comme les mieux aptes à promouvoir la croissance et l'emploi en Europe Occidentale. Nous prétendons qu'actuellement une politique budgétaire active ne paraît pas constituer un instrument adéquat pour la stabilisation économique à court terme. L'attention devrait plutôt se concentrer sur la consolidation structurelle à moyen terme des budgets, un objectif négligé durant l'expansion de la fin des années 80. Mais nous plaidons pour une stimulation monétaire, à obtenir par une forte réduction des taux d'intérêt nominaux à court terme; nous proposons le niveau de référence zéro pour les taux d'intérêt réels à court terme, pour aussi longtemps que l'on n'observe pas clairement que la reprise est engagée. S' agissant des politiques de moyen terme, nous recommandons deux ensembles de mesures relatifs respectivement aux coûts du travail et à l'investissement. Nous notons que le chômage élevé se concentre fortement sur les travailleurs non qualifiés. De plus nous trouvons la preuve d'un désaccord croissant entre les structures par qualifications de l'offre et la demande de travail, la composition de celle-ci se modifiant vite au détriment des travailleurs non qualifiés. Cette observation justifie que l'on investisse dans l'enseignement et la formation. Nous considérons qu'elle justifie aussi des mesures visant à réduire le coût du travail non qualifié par rapport aux coûts du travail qualifié et du capital. Un élément important du coût du travail est constitué par des impôts et contributions sociales, qui entraînent un écart, particulièrement substantiel pour le travail non qualifié, entre le coût pour les employeurs et le coût d'opportunité pour la société — de 30 % à 50 % dans les pays de la Communauté. Nous prétendons que le moment est venu de réduire cet écart et nous proposons d'exempter le salaire minimum des contributions sociales à la charge des employeurs. Cela peut se faire soit en percevant de telles contributions, pour tout salaire, sur la part excédant le salaire minimum, soit en introduisant une exonération dégressive s'élevant à 100 % au niveau du salaire minimum et décroissant linéairement jusqu'à zéro au niveau double. La première modalité implique une réforme substantielle des systèmes fiscaux, car son coût direct s'élève à environ 3, 2 % du PIB en moyenne dans la Communauté, avec des différences importantes suivant les pays. En revanche, le coût de la seconde modalité est plutôt de l'ordre de 1, 2 % du PIB. Dans les deux cas, des ressources de remplacement doivent être trouvées pour la sécurité sociale. Une source naturelle serait l'impôt sur les émissions de CO 2 qui est actuellement examiné par les pays de la Communauté (avec un rendement estimé de l'ordre de 1 à 1, 3 % du PIB). Une autre source résiderait dans un relèvement des taux de la TVA. Pour la définition exacte, la mise en œuvre et le financement de cette mesure, il y a évidemment place à des mesures spécifiques aux divers pays. Les simulations économétriques faites en France et en Belgique concernant les exonérations de taxes sur le travail, doivent être considérées comme imprécises. En termes généraux elles confirment nos idées selon lesquelles il ne faut certes pas espérer un miracle, mais des gains appréciables en emploi peuvent être attendus à moyen terme, sans coût budgétaire, si notre proposition est appliquée sans timidité. A propos de l'investissement, nous reconnaissons que des capacités inutilisées limitent les perspectives immédiates d'équipe- ment des entreprises. Mais nous prétendons que des ressources inemployées peuvent être mobilisées pour des investissements riches en travail, qui auraient des rendements sociaux adéquats et contribueraient de plus à soutenir la demande globale. C'est aussi la logique de l'initiative d'Edimbourg, où les réseaux trans-euro- péens ont reçu la priorité, ainsi que les petites entreprises. Nous prétendons cependant que l'ensemble convenu à Edimbourg est insuffisant. Un programme d'investissement dont le montant correspondrait aux efforts à venir pour la consolidation structurelle des budgets ne créerait pas de tension sur les marchés du capital, tout en compensant le retard pris par les investissements publics dans la décennie passée. Nous avançons le chiffre de 250 milliards d'Ecus (soit grosso modo huit fois l'objectif d'Edimbourg) comme un but réaliste à moyen terme. Nous proposons de privilégier aussi des domaines tels que le logement pour les ménages à bas revenus, la rénovation urbaine et les transports urbains. Afin de stimuler les investissements ainsi visés, nous suggérons que l'on s'en remettre surtout aux subventions à l'emploi, en proportion du contenu en travail des projets retenus. Une telle disposition renforcerait, voire anticiperait, sur notre proposition précédente destinée à réduire les coûts du travail; elle aurait surtout pour effet d'élargir l'ensemble des projets attractifs pour des investisseurs privés et des autorités locales. De plus un meilleur accès au marché du capital devrait être recherché grâce à la collaboration d'intermédiaires institutionnels, à l'accroissement des missions de la Banque Européenne d'Investissement, à l'extension ou à la duplication du Fonds Européen d'Investissement. Notre discussion des problèmes structurels se concentre sur les principes de base. Nous insistons d'abord sur les effets défavorables des incertitudes actuelles qui touchent non seulement certains taux d'inflation, d'intérêt et de change, mais aussi les évolutions institutionnelles dans le domaine monétaire, y compris la tentation récurrente de dévaluations compétitives. Nous ne choisissons pas un programme politique spécifique. Mais nous proclamons que réduire les incertitudes institutionnelles à propos des monnaies constitue un objectif important en lui-même. Il devrait être poursuivi activement, afin d'engager l'Europe monétaire sur une voie plus prometteuse pour l'emploi qu'un retour à des taux de change flottants libres entre les monnaies d'économies relativement petites et intégrées entre elles par d'étroits liens commerciaux. Nous examinons ensuite les finances publiques et l'Etat-provi- dence, en reconnaissant que plusieurs pays ont besoin d'une consolidation structurelle de leurs budgets et qu'il existe des éléments de déception quant aux effets des régimes sociaux. Etudiant la logique économique de l' Etat-providence, nous concluons que les réformes à réaliser devraient viser à le rendre plus svelte et plus efficace, non à le démanteler. Pour cela il faut revoir à fond l'efficacité opérationnelle et distributive des programmes existants, afin d'atteindre deux objectifs difficilement compatibles : réduire dans la plupart des pays la part des transferts sociaux dans le PIB, renforcer la protection des plus mal dotés. Les économistes devraient intensifier leur participation aux recherches destinées à relever cet important défi. Enfin, nous tirons les conséquences salariales d'une Initiative Européenne de Croissance visant à une période d'expansion soutenue, donnant la priorité à l'emploi par rapport aux salaires réels. Nous estimons qu'un schéma réaliste associe une croissance de la production de plus de 3 % l'an à une augmentation de l'emploi de plus de 1 % l'an. Cela laisse une marge d'au plus 2 % pour les salaires réels. Etant donné la présence du glissement salarial, le calcul semble conduire à des accords négociés avec des taux réels à peu près constants. Ce schéma est-il réaliste ? Nous soulevons alors la question controversée du rôle que peuvent jouer sur les salaires les poids comparés des impôts sur le capital et le travail. Nous reconnaissons que la baisse de la part des salaires au cours des années 80 a été accompagnée d'une augmentation de la part des revenus d'intérêt, qui dans de nombreux cas sont peu taxés, notamment en raison de la mobilité des capitaux et d'une concurrence fiscale entre pays. A défaut de déclarations systématiques, un prélèvement à la source uniforme au niveau européen, est le seul moyen de corriger ce déséquilibre en faveur des revenus d'intérêt. La question de savoir si un tel prélèvement est ou non désirable en lui-même de façon permanente est débattue entre spécialistes de la fiscalité. Le débat devrait être élargi pour tenir compte de ce que l'équité dans le traitement fiscal du capital et du travail pourrait contribuer de façon significative à la modération salariale, bien qu'il soit prématuré de considérer les preuves empiriques comme concluantes à cet égard. Nous espérons avoir identifié un ensemble de mesures formant un tout cohérent et avoir défini une initiative ayant la taille du problème qui nous confronte. Ces mesures ont des implications budgétaires conduisant à réallouer quelques pour cent du PIB, donc davantage qu'on l'envisage habituellement. Et elles relèvent de la responsabilité d'un vaste ensemble d'institutions qui ne sont pas engagées dans une coordination systématique de leurs politiques. De sérieux problèmes devraient ainsi être résolus pour une mise en œuvre. Nous en appelons aux responsables politiques pour qu'ils fassent preuve d'audace et de détermination en affrontant ces problèmes. Et nous en appelons aux économistes des milieux académiques pour qu'ils participent activement à la définition et à la promotion d'une initiative européenne ambitieuse.
