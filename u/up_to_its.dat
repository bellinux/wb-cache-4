5|$|Prior to the {{expiration}} of the NEP in 1990, {{there was much}} debate over whether the policy should be renewed, replaced, or scrapped altogether.

The NEP had been faced {{with a number of}} criticisms throughout its lifetime, most of them related to political corruption and other inefficiencies.|$|E

5|$|The novel The Catcher in the Rye by J. D.

The episode also mocks actress Sarah Jessica Parker and the Kardashian family from the reality series Keeping Up with the Kardashians.|$|E
5|$|There {{were great}} {{expectations}} for Kuch Kuch Hota Hai leading <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> premiere, because it re-united the Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge team of Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, and specifically concerning {{the debut of}} Karan Johar, whether {{he would be in}} the same league as Aditya Chopra as a first-time writer/director.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the first}} Broken Sword game, which {{garnered}} critical acclaim, The Smoking Mirror received mixed to positive reviews, mostly for not living <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> predecessor.

The building is sheathed in stucco and presently houses a collection of antique carriages and sleighs {{as well as a}} barbed wire history museum.|$|E
5|$|Cold Fear was {{met with}} mixed reviews, with many critics {{comparing}} it unfavorably to Resident Evil 4. Although critics were generally impressed with the environments and the opening scenes, they found the game too short and felt it failed to live <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> promising beginning. The game was a commercial failure; by February 2006, it had sold only 70,000 units across all three platforms in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Development {{for a pilot}} episode {{began in}} 2010, when 20th Century Fox Television and Imagine TV {{attempted}} to produce the concept {{in time for the}} 2010–11 television season; however, it never materialized. Its scripts were picked up by NBC in January 2011 and two months afterwards, principal photography for the episode commenced in Chicago, Illinois, where it occurred over a period of nine days. The pilot episode was heavily advertised in the weeks leading <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> premiere, as the show's producers collaborated with several companies such as Bloomingdale's to initiate cross-promotional advertising deals.|$|E

5|$|From 1908 to 1909, {{a hundred}} {{electric}} trams were manufactured by Duncan & Fraser of Adelaide {{at a cost}} of approximately £100 each. <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> last tram purchase in 1953, the MTT commissioned over 300 electric trams, some of which have been kept in service for over seventy-five years. TransAdelaide, the publicly owned company now operating Adelaide trams, began introducing a new type of tram in January 2006 {{in the form of the}} Bombardier Flexity Classic. Another new series of trams (Alstom Citadis) started to enter service in December 2009. A further three trams are to be delivered in 2018.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 the Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act {{was passed}} by Parliament and Pembroke College took the {{opportunity}} to place Framlingham into the guardianship of the Commissioner of Works. The undulating Inner Court was levelled <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> present form as part of the Commissioner's maintenance works. During the Second World War, Framlingham was an important defensive location for British forces; at least one concrete pill box was built near to the castle as part of the plans to counter any German invasion, and Nissen huts were erected and a lorry park created in the Bailey.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Gian Carlo Menotti was {{commissioned}} by NBC's Opera Theatre to write an opera for television. After {{a year and a}} half of delay, he set to work, completing Amahl and the Night Visitors five days before its scheduled airing on Christmas Eve 1951 at 9:30 to 10:30p.m.. Menotti's work was inspired by Hieronymous Bosch's painting, The Adoration of the Magi. The composer himself appeared on-screen to introduce the opera and give the background of the events leading <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> composition. He also brought director Kirk Browning and conductor Thomas Schippers on-camera to thank them.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, the Catawba {{sued the}} state of South Carolina and 76 public and private land-owning entities, as named representatives of a {{defendant}} class estimated at 27,000 persons. The tribe contended that the Treaty of Nation Ford was void because of the federal Nonintercourse Act and because the state had not lived <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> obligations (by delaying the purchase for 2.5 years, by spending only $2,000 on the new reservation, and buying land for the new reservation from within the old reservation). The tribe sought both possession of the lands and 140 years of trespass damages. The Catawba were represented by the Native American Rights Fund (NARF).|$|E
5|$|The men {{arrived in}} Singapore on 18 February 1941 {{and moved into}} barracks at Port Dickson, {{in the north of}} Malaya. While there, the {{battalion}} undertook further training to prepare it for jungle warfare, before moving to Seremban in March. Further drafts of reinforcements arrived during this time as the battalion was brought <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> wartime establishment. The rigours of jungle training and the tropical heat affected the men, and a number of personnel were hospitalised during this time with illnesses such as malaria, measles, mumps and serious tropical skin diseases. Some of these were repatriated back to Australia, {{and by the end of}} March, the 2/18th was still below its authorised establishment, with an actual strength of 898.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} various other shipwrecks in the vicinity. In 1889 the paddle steamer Mountaineer lived <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> name by clambering onto Lady's Rock, {{the damage to}} which was still visible in 1995. In 1905 the MacBrayne {{steamship}} Clydesdale hit the same obstruction in a Force 6 wind. The harbour patrol craft Appletree was sunk in a collision with an RAF pinnace east of the Lismore light in October 1940 with, according to one report, the loss of two lives. The trawler MFV Solway Firth foundered south of this position in 1977.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{political}} pressure, the MoD continued to lack confidence in UNAMSIL leadership. Thus, the British government refused to place combat troops under UN command, but did second additional staff officers to UNAMSIL, to the UN headquarters in New York, {{and to the}} SLA. The officers attached to UNAMSIL were tasked with assisting its commanders in planning and mounting operations and were led by a brigadier who became UNAMSIL's chief of staff, while in New York, the officers attached to UN headquarters provided planning support for logistics operations to bring UNAMSIL <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> mandated strength. At the same time, {{the focus of the}} British training programme shifted. Although six battalions had been trained, the SLA still lacked many combat support functions as well as command and control capabilities. The STTTs set out to improve the SLA's capabilities in these areas by providing the next set of recruits with more specialised training in addition to basic infantry training provided to the first intake. The British trainers also constructed an operations room at the SLA's headquarters and provided other support to improve the SLA's communications and logistical capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} 1970, when NASA {{released}} {{a request for}} proposal for 'Phase B' main engine concept studies, requiring development of a throttleable, staged combustion, de Laval-type engine. The request {{was based on the}} then-current design of the Space Shuttle which featured two reusable stages, the orbiter and a manned fly-back booster, and required one engine which would be able to power both vehicles via two different nozzles (12 booster engines with 550,000lbf sea level thrust each and 3 orbiter engines with 632,000lbf vacuum thrust each). Rocketdyne, P and Aerojet General were selected to receive funding although, given P's already-advanced development (demonstrating a working 350,000lbf concept engine during the year) and Aerojet General's prior experience in developing the 1,500,000lbf M-1 engine, Rocketdyne was forced to put a large amount of private money into the design process to allow the company to catch <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> competitors.|$|E
5|$|Georgia coach Herman Stegeman, in {{the section}} on Southern {{football}} in Spalding's football guide, wrote that Vanderbilt had a good year {{but was unable to}} play <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> full capabilities and the Commodores should prepare for a fine season the next year. For Stegeman, the contest for the theoretical title of greatest Southern team in 1921 was between Centre, Georgia Tech, and Georgia. Clyde Berryman retroactively listed Vanderbilt as national champion. Lynn Bomar at fullback, Pos Elam at tackle, and Thomas Ryan at end were listed on Walter Camp's list of notable players. Bomar, Elam, Ryan, Tot McCullough, Alf Sharpe, and Pink Wade all made an All-Southern team although, according to the yearbook, Tom Ryan was the only player in the group to appear on an All-Southern team.|$|E
