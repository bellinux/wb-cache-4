5|$|In 1988, Public Enemy {{released}} {{their second}} album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold <b>Us</b> <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> critical and commercial success. Their music's dense textures, {{provided by the}} group's production team The Bomb Squad, exemplified a new production aesthetic in hip hop at the time. The controversial, politically charged lyrics by the group's lead rapper Chuck D, whose braggadocio raps contained references to political figures such as Assata Shakur and Nelson Mandela, as well as endorsements of Nation of Islam-leader Louis Farrakhan, intensified the group's affiliation with black nationalism and Farrakhan. It Takes a Nations success helped raise hip hop's profile as both art and sociopolitical statement, amid media criticism of the genre. It helped give hip hop a critical credibility and standing in the popular music community after it had been largely dismissed as a fad since its introduction {{at the turn of}} the 1980s. In promoting the record, Public Enemy expanded their live shows and performing dynamic. With the album's content and the group's rage-filled showmanship in concert, they became the vanguard of a movement in hip hop that reflected a new black consciousness and socio-political dynamic that were taking shape in America at the time.|$|E

25|$|The Roman Emperor Octavian, upset that, {{after seven}} years of marriage, his wife has born him no child, weeps to himself in bed. Octavian's wife hears this and tries to comfort him with the {{suggestion}} that they build an abbey and dedicate it to the Virgin Mary. In thanks the Virgin will provide them with a child, she is sure (Octavian became the Roman Emperor Augustus in 27 BC, nearly thirty years before the birth of Christ.

Taking this loss in their stride, they returned to the <b>US,</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Vermont — Carrie by this time was pregnant with their first child —and rented a small cottage on a farm near Brattleboro for ten dollars a month.|$|E
25|$|This brings <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Wittgenstein's {{reliance}} on indirect communication, and his {{reliance on}} thought-experiments. Some philosophical confusions come about because we aren't {{able to see}} family resemblances. We've {{made a mistake in}} understanding the vague and intuitive rules that language uses, and have thereby tied ourselves up in philosophical knots. He suggests that an attempt to untangle these knots requires more than simple deductive arguments pointing out the problems with some particular position. Instead, Wittgenstein's larger goal is to try to divert us from our philosophical problems long enough to become aware of our intuitive ability to see the family resemblances.|$|E
25|$|The Samaritans {{assert that}} Mount Gerizim was the {{original}} Holy Place of Israel {{from the time that}} Joshua conquered Israel and the ten tribes settled the land. According to the Bible, the story of Mount Gerizim takes <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the story of the time when Moses ordered Joshua to take the Twelve Tribes of Israel to the mountains by Shechem and place half of the tribes, six in number, on the top of Mount Gerizim (Mount of the Blessing), and the other half in Mount Ebal (Mount of the Curse). The two mountains were used to symbolize the significance of the commandments and serve as a warning to whoever disobeyed them.|$|E

25|$|So there’s no real choice this year, {{but what}} the Occupy {{movement}} has done has taken <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the era when Martin Luther King was in the Sixties said ‘This is unacceptable!’ We cannot {{have a situation where}} everything is owned by the 1% {{in the same way that}} Martin Luther King said in the Riverside Church that we have a government that is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today, we are exploiting the planet, and that is unacceptable. So the memory of Martin Luther King – it’s about dreams, but it’s also about the courage to draw a line right there and say ‘We cannot go on crossing this line. This is a moral line, this is a line concerning power and the world’. And there today America is on that line. And people know that what we got to – these years after Martin Luther King was murdered – is completely unacceptable, and it’s his example that will inspire us as we go forward into this year.|$|E

It can take <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our past and think about where we were when we were writing these songs, and that's a bond, I think, [...] will always keep us together as four people....

500|$|The {{significance}} of the bowling culture was, according to Joel, [...] "important in reflecting that period {{at the end of}} the fifties and the beginning of the sixties.

When Kennedy tried to tie Romney's policies to those of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, Romney responded, [...] "Look, I was an independent {{during the time of}} Reagan-Bush. I'm not trying to take <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Reagan-Bush." [...] Romney stated, [...] "Ultimately, this is a campaign about change." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Eurogamer, Chahi emphasised that the developers tried initially to avoid including overt religious elements in the game. Tribal worship, totems, and animal-shaped monuments are examples of the quasi-religious characters of From Dust. Chahi explained that, during one mission, the player would physically divide an ocean in order to assist their tribe in crossing it and so forth. He indicated that Ubisoft Montpellier were reluctant: [...] "we didn't {{want to take it}} in this direction", but the [...] "game kept pushing <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> it". When asked the meaning of the game's title, Bunier remarked that [...] "it's just another universe, another place, something people create from dust". Separately, Chahi commented that the game centered on the fragility of life and brevity of humankind.|$|E

500|$|The {{controversy}} {{resulted in}} {{pressure on the}} new Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone, who agreed to review the cases of twenty-four stateless people in immigration detention, and ultimately granted bridging visas to nine people including Al-Kateb, allowing them to be released into the community. However, {{the conditions of the}} bridging visas did not permit holders to work, study, obtain social security benefits or receive healthcare from Medicare, and Al-Kateb remained entirely dependent on donations from friends and supporters to survive. Al-Kateb said of his situation, [...] "We [...] just walking in a big detention. And we are all the time worried that they will send <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> detention again… It's like a death punishment." [...] He was granted a permanent visa in October 2007 by immigration minister Kevin Andrews.|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} address to [...] {{parliament}} {{as head of}} government, Harper opened by paying tribute to the Queen of Canada, Elizabeth II, and her [...] "lifelong dedication to duty and self-sacrifice." [...] He also said before the Canada-UK Chamber of Commerce that Canada and the United Kingdom were joined by [...] "the golden circle of the Crown, which links us all together with the majestic past that takes <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Tudors, the Plantagenets, the Magna Carta, habeas corpus, petition of rights, and English common law." [...] Journalist Graham Fraser said in the Toronto Star that Harper's speech was [...] "one of the most monarchist speeches a Canadian prime minister has given since John Diefenbaker." [...] An analysis by Michael D. Behiels suggests a political realignment may be underway based on the continuance of Harper's government.|$|E
500|$|At the 1991 Academy Awards, Madonna {{appeared}} with singer Michael Jackson as her date and performed [...] "Sooner or Later". According to journalist Liz Smith, Madonna {{had promised to}} perform at the award show if either [...] "Sooner or Later" [...] or [...] "More" [...] was nominated in the Best Original Song category. She wore a long, tight, white dress designed by Bob Mackie and covered in sequins and pearls. On her neck she wore $20 million worth of jewelry from Harry Winston. Taraborrelli recalled that Madonna had appropriated every move and mannerisms of Marilyn Monroe for the performance, making it {{a tribute to the}} actress. When she appeared onstage, there was technical difficulty resulting in the microphone not rising from below the stage, and a stage-hand passing it to her. Billboard ranked it as the seventh [...] "most awesome" [...] Oscar performance of all time, saying that [...] "Madonna gave a performance that took <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the glamorous days of old Hollywood." ...|$|E
