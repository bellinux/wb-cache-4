These are stored while at sea in davits alongside the lifeboats.

The fire came right <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the largest playgrounds in Los Angeles, Shane's Inspiration, and the Los Angeles Zoo, and threatened the Griffith Observatory, but left these areas intact. Several local organizations, including SaveGriffithPark.org, have been working since then with local officials to restore the park {{in a way that}} would benefit all. It was the third fire of the year. The city announced a $50million plan to stabilize the burned slopes. The trees along Canyon Drive were allowed to grow back naturally, having been re-seeded by bird droppings.|$|E

500|$|AllMusic writer William Ruhlmann {{said that}} [...] "Linkin Park {{sounds like a}} Johnny-come-lately to an already {{overdone}} musical style" [...] and called [...] "One Step Closer" [...] "a typical effort", referring to the lyrics of the song's chorus. Johan Wippsson from Melodic praised Don Gilmore's production and described the albums as [...] "destructive and angry but always with a well controlled melodic feeling all over." [...] NMEs Noel Gardner commented that [...] "otherwise damn fine soaring emo-crunchers like 'With You' and 'A Place for My Head' are pointlessly jazzed up with tokenistic scratching," [...] giving the album a score of six out of ten. Tyler Fisher at Sputnikmusic gave the album a 3.0/5, saying [...] "Hybrid Theory stands as a defining mainstream album {{at the turn of}} the century, and for good reason.", but calling the guitar riffs [...] "often bland and unoriginal". Mike Ross of Jam! declares the albums as a combination of the best of hip hop and heavy metal. He goes on to state [...] "...they can actually rap. They can actually crank out a ferocious, head-banging groove. They can write introspective lyrics with intelligence. It adds <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the finest new rap metal bands I've ever heard." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{praised the}} episode, {{saying that it}} was [...] "an absolutely perfect episode with not a moment wasted [...] equally hilarious were the storylines between Jack and Kenneth, and Tracy and Jenna. The episode had everything that makes 30 Rock great." [...] Canning opined that Liz's admissions to Oprah Winfrey were [...] "painfully funny", and that Tracy [...] "was on fire" [...] following his actions in this episode. In conclusion, Canning gave it a 10 out of 10 rating. Jeremy Medina of Paste was complimentary towards the episode, reporting that it had [...] "madcap humor tirelessly delivered one joke after another at a lightning fast speed, adding <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the funniest episodes in the series." [...] Medina enjoyed the social experiment between Jenna and Tracy, noting that it was [...] "hilarious". TV Guides Matt Mitovich commented that the episode was [...] "Rock-solid", while Neal Justin of the Star Tribune believed it was [...] "the most brilliant episode in the series' history". Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger wrote that [...] "Believe in the Stars" [...] belonged to Tina Fey [...] "who has grown by leaps and bounds as an actress over the past few years. The Princess Leia voice, her drunken panic on the plane and the religious fervor at the knowledge that Oprah would be coming to the studio were all hilarious, and played with the sort of confidence I don't know that she would have had {{at the start of the}} series." ...|$|E
2500|$|Richie {{said that}} about halfway through the reveal episode, Alfie [...] "resigns himself {{to the fact that}} it's over between Kat and Alfie, there is no going back", and said that Neilson said halfway through the 15-minute scene that Alfie would be thinking, [...] "I {{understand}} you've done this with somebody... We can get over this... What do you mean... it's been going on for months? We can get over it, because I know you don't love him... What, you love this guy? It's someone we know? Someone in the pub...?", and said that Alfie needs to know who it is for his own peace of mind, though [...] "his whole life just crumbles in his hands". Richie said that viewers would be surprised by the final reveal, stating that [...] "it's really interesting about how we play the Branning card as to which one of them it is. The way it's worded, you believe it's one brother in particular and then that all changes and you go, 'oh it's him!' Because we make people believe it's another Branningâ€”the way its worded, the way I face <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them. The audience will all think it's one person in particular, but then I throw a curve ball and it all kicks off. It's great." [...] Richie said that Alfie cannot understand why Kat is having an affair with Derek, which [...] "makes him sick". He also stated that viewers would find out in January 2013 why Kat had the affair with the person she did. He said: [...] "It's an ongoing story, which is really interesting, to see why Kat was with Alfie and why she went for this bloke because they both offer her different things." [...] Richie speculated that the reason Kat had an affair with Derek is [...] "because Derek is the total polar opposite of Alfie" [...] and Kat is [...] "attracted to danger", which is not like Alfie, and Kat is [...] "used to danger, she's used to excitement. What she got from Alfie was the fairytale, what she wanted was the nightmare". However, the reasons for Kat having the affair were never explained on screen.|$|E
