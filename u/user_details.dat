In response, Linden Lab revoked Emerald's third-party viewer approval and permanently banned several of Emerald's developers.

50|$|UMTS phones {{can use a}} Universal Subscriber Identity Module, USIM (based on GSM's SIM) {{and also}} work (including UMTS services) with GSM SIM cards.

Roaming agreements between networks allow for calls to a customer to be redirected to them while roaming and determine the services (and prices) available to the user. In addition to user subscriber information and authentication information, the (U)SIM provides storage space for phone book contact. Handsets can store their data on their own memory or on the (U)SIM card (which is usually more limited in its phone book contact information). A (U)SIM can be moved to another UMTS or GSM phone, and the phone will take on the <b>user</b> <b>details</b> of the (U)SIM, meaning it is the (U)SIM (not the phone) which determines the phone number of the phone and the billing for calls made from the phone.|$|E
