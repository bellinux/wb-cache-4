He is a Herald of the Inner Court, a secret agent of his Shogun. Steve discovers that Cadillac copied Steve's technical knowledge <b>using</b> <b>wordsmith</b> magic, and is making recon gliders for the Iron Masters, masquerading as Steve (since Mutes are supposed to be illiterate). The arrival of Steve, Cadillac and Clearwater throws the internal political groups into some turmoil, and Steve receives some offers. Steve agrees to help Cadillac with the gliders, in exchange for Toshiro's help in getting them all out of the country at the end. Toshiro then gets Steve to kill one of the seventeen daiyamo (domain-lords). They then escape to a secret First Family recon station with two other federation runaways, where they steal transportation and fly back to Wyoming. But this is according to the Family's plan, and one of the runaways is a spy.|$|E

To provide students with an understanding of the features of the discourses they may encounter, this study investigates lexical bundles (LBs) used in the reading passages of Malaysian University English Test (MUET), a compulsory entrance examination for tertiary education. More specifically it aims to compare and contrast the functional types of LBs found in arts and science-based reading passages. A specialised corpus of MUET test papers made up of only the reading passages categorised into two main traditional disciplines; arts and science was built <b>using</b> <b>WordSmith</b> Tools Version 5. The lists of LBs of the identified disciplines were generated <b>using</b> <b>WordSmith</b> Tools Version 5. The generated data was then analysed qualitatively based on Hyland’s (2008) Functional Taxonomy. Findings revealed that although the number of LBs in both disciplines shows significant difference, many similar LBs are found. Science-based passages employ more research-based LBs whereas arts-based texts employ more participant-oriented LBs. These findings seemed to confirm that the functions of LBs are specific to particular disciplines. Hence, explicit teaching of LBs should be considered in schools and two separate sets of MUET reading tests where the first comprises of texts adopted from the scientific and technological context while the other made up of texts from the social sciences should be designed to accommodate both arts and science stream pre-university students...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{reports a}} study using a corpus of lecture {{introductions}} {{to explore the}} generic features of the language used. The main research questions: What are the main communicative functions of this sub-genre? How are the functions realised? Are there any disciplinary differences in university lecture introductions? are explored using two complementary methods of analysis; genre analysis and corpus analysis. Analysis of eighty-nine lecture introductions from the BASE corpus 1 resulted in a Lecture Introduction Framework which posits a two-level classification which first differentiates lecture content orientation (Thompson, 1994) versus listener orientation (Dubois, 1980). This yields three main functions, with additional sub-functions original to this study. The study reveals differences {{in the frequency of}} different sub-functions in the four disciplinary domains, reflecting different disciplinary cultures and knowledge. The corpus analysis generated a word frequency list for lecture introductions, giving a rich linguistic description of the lexis used. Further analysis on one of the three main functions; the Set Up Lecture Framework Function <b>uses</b> <b>WordSmith</b> Tools 5 to analyse the linguistic realisations of the three subfunctions, which are also the top three most used sub-functions in the corpus. Analysis of pronouns and keywords further supports the finding that there are disciplinary variations in lecture introductions...|$|R

See Partington (2010) for further details. The first corpus contains around 100 million words (about twenty-seven million from the Guardian, thirty-four million from the Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph, and thirty-nine million from the Times and Sunday Times). The second, contains about 145 million (forty-one million from the Guardian, thirty-seven million from the Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph, and sixty-seven million from the Times and Sunday Times). First, I discuss the problem involved in investigating a prefix, and I follow this with {{an examination of the}} prefix itself. Although the overall proportion of anti prefixing has remained fairly similar over time, (unlike pro which has decreased), there are key changes in the stems or ‘targets’ of the prefix which reflect changes in social and political concerns. Among the findings are changes in the way that antibiotics are talked about, and an increase in the discourse about products designed to deal with age-related problems. The study also examines co-texts and contexts of anti terms expressing opposition to groups distinguished by their nationality, religion or ethnic origins, and differences in the ways such opposition is constructed. The analysis illustrates how modern diachronic corpus-assisted discourse studies (MD-CADS) can contribute to research into socio-cultural and political language and highlights the value of investigating prefixes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a longitudinal {{case study of}} the academic writing of four undergraduate Chinese students from UK universities in terms {{of changes in the}} lexical chunks in their assessed writing. A total of 37 assignments comprising 48, 000 words from the students’ writing within the disciplines of Engineering, Hospitality Management, and Food Science are analysed with the aim of tracing the development of chunks over time. A further aim is methodological since two approaches to identifying chunks are compared. In the literature on lexical chunks, a dichotomy is frequently purported to exist between intuition-based methods of finding language deemed to be ‘formulaic’ (Wray, 2008), and frequency-based means of extracting ‘n-grams’ using computer software. In the former method, each student’s assignments are read by this researcher in order to identify noticeable chunks. The second method <b>uses</b> <b>WordSmith</b> Tools v. 5 (Scott, 2008) to compare the number of occurrences of chunks within assignments by individual students with the number of occurrences found in reference corpora of first language English texts in the same disciplines. This paper discusses the benefits of combining both of these methods in a recursive process of reading the original Word documents and conducting corpus analyses on the texts. Discussion centres on how the methods complement and reveal more about the students’ writing together than either can in isolation. The analyses also uncover changes in each student’s writing over the three year period of their undergraduate degrees. Finally, tentative suggestions are made with regard to the teaching of academic writing to both native English speaking and non-native English speaking student groups across discipline areas.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a corpus-based analysis {{of variation in}} the distribution and function of modals and {{their role in the}} expression of “stance ” in a corpus of 600 research articles (RAs) across twelve disciplines. Stance is an expression of attitudes, judgments, or assessments towards the truth of propositions (Biber et al., 1999), and part of the important function of claiming and confirming membership of discourse communities and therefore in constructing identity. Three functional categories of modals perform a valuable role in the construction of stance: Possibility/Ability, Obligation/Necessity, and Prediction (Biber et al., 1999). However, very little research seems to have investigated variation across disciplines or their use in the RA. The corpus was analysed <b>using</b> <b>WordSmith</b> Tools (Scott, 2004), followed by manual checking of the function of every occurrence. Inter- and intra-rater agreement was also checked. Many statistically significant disciplinary differences were found, along with numerous marked differences with individual modals.

Conclusions are that modals perform {{an important role in the}} construction of stance...|$|E

40|$|Chinese {{students}} {{are now the}} largest non-native English group in UK universities (British Council, 2008), yet relatively little is known of this group’s undergraduate-level writing. This paper describes a corpus study of Chinese and British students’ undergraduate assignments from UK universities. A corpus of 267, 000 words from first language (L 1) Mandarin and Cantonese students is compared with a reference corpus of 1. 3 million words of L 1 English students’ writing. Both corpora were compiled from the 6. 5 million- word British Academic Written English (Bawe) corpus with some additionally-collected texts. Each corpus contains successful assignments from the same disciplines and from a similar range of genres (such as essays, empathy writing, laboratory reports and case studies). The aims {{of this study are}} to explore similarities and differences in the writing of the two student groups, and to track development from year 1 to year 3 of undergraduate study with a view to making pedagogical recommendations. <b>WordSmith</b> Tools was <b>used</b> to extract key words, key key words and key clusters from the Chinese corpus, and compare these with the British students’ writing within different disciplines. Clusters were further explored <b>using</b> <b>WordSmith’s</b> Concgram feature to consider non-contiguous n-grams. Both key words and clusters were assigned to categories based on Halliday’s metafunctions (Halliday and Matthiessen 2004). The key word findings showed the influence of the discipline of study in the writing of both student groups, even at first year level and with topic-specific key words excluded. This has implications for the teaching of English for Academic Purposes (EAP) for both native and non-native speakers, as discipline-specific teaching is still {{the exception rather than the}} norm in EAP classes. The comparison of cluster usage suggests that Chinese students use fewer clusters within the textual and interpersonal categories and many more topic-based clusters. One reason for this may be the students’ strategy of using features other than connected text to display information: for example the greater use of lists and pseudo lists in methodology sections and tables in the results sections of scientific reports. The Chinese students also employed three times as many “listlike” text sections as the British students; these consist of text within paragraphs in a pseudo list format (Heuboeck et al, 2007 : 29) ...|$|R
40|$|The intense {{concentration}} process {{taking place in}} the financial systems has attracted substantial attention from stakeholders and academics. The impact of M&A on the value creation and efficiency/effectiveness improvements of banks involved appears, on the whole, disappointing and it is still hard to create benefits for customers. Management literature points to the difficulties of governing a post-merger integration process and recognizes the importance of corporate culture for explaining success. In fact, cultural clashes could, on one hand, generate conflicts and have negative effects on the timing and effectiveness of the post-merger integration process and, on the other hand, could influence the motivation and turnover of individuals. Set in the Italian banking industry, this paper proposes a framework, applied to a representative sample of cases (about 78. 2 percent of market share, based on total assets), for assessing cultural similarities of actors involved in M&A transactions. Corporate culture is measured using an ethnographic approach focused on language as its special artefact. The assessment is based on the definition of some key concepts that are relevant for the banking industry (i. e., competencies, competition, customer, disclosure, human resources, innovation, and risk) and on a text-analysis model applied to a corpus of reference texts produced by the surveyed banks three years before the transaction. The elaboration of data <b>uses</b> <b>Wordsmith</b> 4, a text analysis software developed by Oxford University. The underlying assumption of this work is that the failure of M&A transactions does not depend only on errors made before the deal, concerning strategic and organizational analysis, but rather on the procedures for the implementation of the various phases that follow the conclusion of the operation, as well as the capacity of management in dealing with the complexity of the operation and with the problems of integration [Shojai (2009) ]. An especially important problem is the presence of areas of conflict between the cultures of the different firms, which can constitute one of the main causes of failure. This work aims to create a model for assessment of the cultural compatibility of the banks involved in M&A transactions, with subsequent application of the model to real case studies...|$|R

40|$|The intense {{concentration}} process {{taking place in}} the financial systems of the major countries has attracted substantial attention from stakeholders and academics. The impact of M&A on value creation and efficiency / effectiveness improvements of banks involved appears, on the whole, disappointing and still hard to create benefits for customers. The reason seems to lie in the difficulty of governing a post-merger integration process, which generally requires good governance and management practices, significant experience and attention to cultural profiles and individuals’ behavior. More in detail, management literature recognizes the importance of corporate culture, considered as the set of values and decisions that drive individuals’ behaviors within organizations, for explaining alliance success in M&A operations. In fact cultural clashes could determine conflicts and negative effects, on one hand, on the timing and the effectiveness of the post-merger integration process and, on the other hand, on motivation and turnover of individuals. Set in Italian banking industry, this paper proposes a framework, applied to a representative sample of cases (about 78, 2 % of market share, based on total assets), for assessing cultural similarity of actors involved in M&A operations.

The results show that there were more errors made by the form 4 s compared to the form 5 s even though the difference of the frequencies of errors produced by both the levels were not of much difference. Therefore, {{the findings of this study}} can be used as a guide in enabling secondary school teachers to revise and be more prepared in their teaching instructions, materials and procedures. It will help teachers look into the possible remedial actions which could be taken into consideration to overcome the problems faced by Malaysian secondary school students in using the Auxiliary “Be” Present Tense verb...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an analysis of}} eight categories of stance adverbials, for example “definitely” and “usually”, in a corpus of 600 research articles (RAs) across 12 disciplines, six science and six non-science. Stance adverbials may {{play an important role}} in the key RA functions of putting forward claims and propositions. However, there has been very little previous research in the area. A new list of stance adverbials was developed and frequency, function and disciplinary variation were examined <b>using</b> <b>WordSmith</b> Tools. Stance adverbials in two categories, Limitation and Doubt and Certainty, were much more prevalent than hitherto suspected. Numerous statistically significant disciplinary differences, for example between the sciences and non-sciences, were also found. A closer examination of science RAs was undertaken. Authors were found to develop claims in a different way, putting greater weight on methods and procedures, while non-science authors tended more towards discursive argument. The techniques of semantic preference, the creation of meaning through multiple occurrences of collocates (Hunston, 2007), were also adopted to further examine function. Conclusions are that stance adverbials {{play an important role in}} the construction of stance in RAs, though this differs by discipline. Finally, semantic preference techniques may be a valuable method for corpus-based research...|$|E
40|$|The article {{reports on}} a {{research}} project aimed at identifying salient written genres and text types/rhetorical modes in the Faculty of Humanities at a large university in Gauteng, South Africa. The main purpose of the research was to establish an empirical base {{for the design of}} intermediate-level undergraduate language courses. A survey was done by means of text analysis: study guides were requested from a representative sample of departments, after which writing prompts were identified and analysed <b>using</b> <b>Wordsmith</b> Tools. In terms of genre it has been established that the humanities prefer essays and critical analyses, while the social sciences prefer project reports and essays. The rhetorical modes required most frequently at undergraduate level are discussion, analysis, argumentation, explanation and description. Discussion, explanation and argumentation are favoured by academic essays, while description and evaluation are favoured by reports, and analysis, argumentation and discussion are favoured by critical analyses. Although most essays presuppose argumentation, it is often not explicated in writing prompts. Other complicating factors are the ambiguity and hidden assumptions associated with certain rhetorical verbs. The outcomes of the research suggest two possible approaches to designing writing courses for undergraduate students in the humantities and social sciences: semi-generic approach, of which the latter may be more feasible within the framework of a macro-university...|$|E
40|$|Biber et al. (1999) contend linking adverbials perform {{important}} cohesive and connective functions by signalling {{connections between}} units of discourse; however, {{there has been}} little previous corpus-based research in this important area of ESP. This paper describes an analysis of linking adverbials, such as “however ” and “therefore”, in a corpus of 320 published research articles (RAs) across eight disciplines, four science and four non-science. New lists of linking adverbials were developed and the parameters of frequency, function and disciplinary variation were examined <b>using</b> <b>WordSmith</b> Tools. They were found to be more frequent than previously thought, with numerous statistically significant disciplinary differences, for example between the sciences and non-sciences. Also, they often clustered together in complex sequences. A close examination of RAs in two of the sciences revealed some reasons for the much lower rate of occurrence there. Authors developed claims in a different way, describing methods and results in a more narrative or descriptive style rather than explicitly telling readers the connections between ideas, claims and facts. Conclusions are that linking adverbials are more important in RAs as signalling and cohesive devices, and for helping RA authors construct and strengthen claims, than previously thought by experts in this field. Also, different disciplines achieve this in significantly different ways, confirming the importance of discipline variation when researching their use...|$|E
5000|$|Boylan {{entered the}} {{entertainment}} industry as a stage actor {{while working as a}} newspaper reporter and publicist at the Los Angeles Express Tribune. He became acquainted with the business of film in the early 1920s when he took the position of director of publicity for Universal and First National. He began supervising a weekly newsreel for Universal. In the early 1920s, he wrote the story line for three short films. Boylan became editorial supervisor for Fox Pictures and, in 1925, he began to create silent-film screen titles for fun. He {{made a name for himself}} by writing titles for the 1926 silent version of What Price Glory. [...] The quality of his work was so good that he was soon listed in credits as [...] "Title Designer" [...] in The Great K&A Train Robbery with Tom Mix. With the advent of talkies, Boylan entered the realm of screenwriting in which he, primarily, worked as a script doctor. Though some of Boylan's screenplays were produced, he mainly contributed dialogue to scripts needing polish. His work creating additional dialogue started at Fox Pictures. Boylan later <b>used</b> his <b>wordsmith</b> skills at Columbia as well as at other studios such as Disney. Though much of his work was unbilled, Boylan contributed to/wrote more than 90 screenplays and teleplays between 1921 and 1963.|$|R
40|$|This article {{highlights}} {{some basic}} {{aspects of the}} Systemic Functional Grammar described by Halliday (1984 and 1994) ]and his followers; we intend to analyze the modalization {{in the construction of}} discursive strategies in MA dissertation introductions. The corpus is composed of 10 MA dissertation introductions with emphasis in the arguments for the research, which are reinforced by the constant occurrence of NECESSITY JUSTIFICATION and AIMS OF THE RESEARCH. We adopt the methodology called case study; therefore we analyze a specifi c discourse community and, for this, we <b>used</b> the software <b>Wordsmith</b> Tools (Scott, 1996), a device that allowed us to analyze in a detailed manner the lexical items from the texts. The analysis of our corpus showed that, at the Program in Applied Linguistics and Language Studies of PUC-SP, modalization is frequently used through modal verbs in the excerpts called NECESSITY JUSTIFICATION and AIMS OF THE RESEARCH...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} a {{corpus of}} 400 popular songs downloaded from www. ethaimusic. com on the Internet. The techniques of corpus linguistics {{were used to}} analyze this body of music {{in an effort to}} better prepare language teachers to use these songs in the classroom. Corpus linguistics is the study of language using large bodies of text. While linguists have always been interested in data, that interest waned considerably during the heyday of Noam Chomsky. The modern computer has refocused our attention and allowed us to examine large bodies of authentic data. The analysis of pop songs that we present allows us to focus on key linguistic features found in this music. <b>Using</b> Oxford <b>WordSmith</b> Tools 4. 0, we have looked at word frequencies and concordances in order to get an overall picture of the language found in these songs. We examine features such as pronoun usage, references to emotions and body parts, elaborate expressions, slang spellings, Sanskrit vocabulary and English terminology found in these texts. Our findings provide guidance to language teachers in a number of ways. For example, they point out which vocabulary is high frequency and therefore essential to teach. They also indicate major collocational usage, essential knowledge for the language learner. The lyrics we analyzed allow students to engage in data-driven learning. These same tools applied to other genres could have tremendous impact on the way Thai and other languages are taught in the United States...|$|R
