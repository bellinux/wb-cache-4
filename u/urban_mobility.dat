In 2007, 72% of the European population lived in urban areas, which are key to growth and employment. Cities need efficient transport systems to support their economy and the welfare of their inhabitants. Around 85% of the EU’s GDP is generated in cities. Urban areas face today the challenge of making transport sustainable in environmental (CO2, air pollution, noise) and competitiveness (congestion) terms {{while at the same time}} addressing social concerns. These range from the need to respond to health problems and demographic trends, fostering economic and social cohesion to taking into account the needs of persons with reduced mobility, families and children.|$|E

The Texas Transportation Institute, which publishes an annual <b>Urban</b> <b>Mobility</b> Report, ranked Los Angeles road traffic as the most congested in the United States in 2005 as measured by annual delay per traveler. The average traveler in Los Angeles experienced 72 hours of traffic delay per year according to the study. Los Angeles was followed by San Francisco/Oakland, Washington, D.C. and Atlanta, (each with 60 hours of delay). Despite the congestion in the city, the mean travel time for commuters in Los Angeles is shorter than other major cities, including New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago.

40|$|The 'mobility turn' {{in social}} {{sciences}} (Cresswell 2006; Hannam, Sheller et al. 2006; Sheller and Urry 2006) {{is based on}} the inevitable impacts all types of mobility currently have on contemporary living and "examines how social relations necessitate the intermittent and intersecting movement of people, objects, information and images across distance" (Urry 2007 : 54). Mobility studies include research on migration, tourism, residential <b>mobility</b> and <b>urban</b> daily <b>mobility</b> - the latter is the central interest of this thesis. <b>Urban</b> daily <b>mobility</b> refers to all the ways people relate experientially to change of place on a daily basis, which means that it encompasses {{more than the sum of}} journeys made or the time it takes to make them. This understanding of mobility as a social practice requires methodological access to the social meaning invested in movement, whether that movement is physical, imaginative, virtual, or a combination of these. How do practices of <b>urban</b> daily <b>mobility</b> shape the way urban living is experienced in contemporary cities. This thesis addresses mobility as a social practice and uses an ethnographic approach to explore the way mobility is experienced daily by selected individuals in Santiago de Chile. It argues that an <b>urban</b> daily <b>mobility</b> approach captures an ontological shift in the way the urban spaces are experienced. This shift has implications for the way urban relations and urban structures are observed; that is, from fixed physical entities to moving and dynamic relations. Moreover, this shift has significant implications in various areas of urban analysis, each of which is examined by this thesis. First, it requires adopting methodologies that can reveal daily mobility experiences and find adequate ways of representing these experiences. Second, it incorporates mobility into the notion of place, by introducing the concepts of mobile places and transient places it discusses the possibility of mobile place making. Third, it questions the static way of analysing urban inequality and expands the notion of urban social exclusion to incorporate differentiated mobility as another one of its causes, consequences and manifestations. Fourth, it provides a way of looking at spatial relations in the city by understanding the implications of <b>urban</b> daily <b>mobility</b> in terms of place confinement and enlargement. Finally, it affects the way urban policy interventions are understood, analysed here in terms of the implementation of the Transantiago transport system. Mobility in these terms becomes not only a practice through which daily living can be observed, it may also be a locus for encounter, conflict, negotiation and transformation, thus requiring further research as a space of socialisation...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} endeavours to fill {{a conceptual}} gap in the social science literature on gender, public space, and <b>urban</b> <b>mobilities</b> by exploring how transgender and gender nonconforming individuals experience public transit. Although previous research has surveyed gender minorities about harassment and discrimination {{in a range of}} environments, {{little is known about the}} quality or content of these experiences. Drawing from 25 interviews with transgender and gender nonconforming individuals in Portland, Oregon, this article finds that gender minorities experience frequent harassment while engaging with the public transit system. We articulate the concept of transmobilites to describe the ways that transgender and gender nonconforming individuals experience a form of mobility that is altered, shaped, and informed by a broader cultural system that normalizes violence and harassment towards gender minorities. We conclude that gender minorities have unequal access to safe and accessible public transportation when harassment is widespread, normalized, and when policies prohibiting discrimination remain unenforced on urban public transit...|$|R

What are the main themes of twenty-first century urban anthropological research? What are the possible future directions in the field? The chapters cover topics such as <b>urban</b> <b>mobilities,</b> place-making and public space, production and consumption, politics and governance.

Melbourne as a metropolitan area has encountered the risk of increasing car dependency and subsequent health problems among residents. This paper aims to investigate the association between the built environment features and active travel behaviour.
