Six of the zones, A–F, are in the Lower Peninsula while the Upper Peninsula is divided into the remaining two, G and H. There have been a total of 66different highways designated in seven of the zones; as of 2015 no E highways have been named.

25|$|The Cobra Missile System is a {{functional}} {{development of the}} XM26 and the TOW missile system developed for the failed AH-56 helicopter. Originally designed for the AH-1Q and AH-1S Cobras, the AH-1F Modernized Cobra was also rebuilt to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>system.</b> The original iteration of the system comprises launchers allowing for four BGM-71 TOW missiles per aircraft pylon to be carried, and a TSU or Telescopic Sight Unit, to allow for targeting and guidance of the missile. The TSU has been upgraded with the LAAT (Laser-Augmented Airborne TOW), a day/night range finder, and C-NITE (Cobra-Night Imaging Thermal Equipment), a thermal imagine/FLIR system specifically for the AH-1S and AH-1F Cobra helicopters.|$|E
25|$|At the 2007 World Snooker Championship, the BBC used Hawk-Eye for {{the first}} time in its {{television}} coverage to show player views, particularly in the incidents of potential snookers. It has also been used to demonstrate intended shots by players when the actual shot has gone awry. It is now used by the BBC at every World Championship, as well as some other major tournaments. The BBC used to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> sporadically, for instance in the 2009 Masters at Wembley the Hawk-Eye was at most used once or twice per frame. Its usage has decreased significantly and is now only used within the World Championships and very rarely in any other tournament on the snooker tour. In contrast to tennis, Hawk-Eye is never used in snooker to assist referees' decisions and primarily used to assist viewers in showing what the player is facing.|$|E

25|$|Evolution of a hypercycle ensues {{from the}} {{creation}} of new components by the mutation of its internal species. Mutations can be incorporated into the hypercycle, enlarging it if, and only if, two requirements are satisfied. First, a new information carrier I'new created by the mutation must be better recognized by one of the hypercycle's members Ii than the chain I'i+1 that was previously recognized by it. Secondly, the new member I'new of the cycle has to better catalyse the formation of the polynucleotide I'i+1 that was previously catalysed by the product of its predecessor I'i. In theory, it is possible to incorporate into the hypercycle mutations that do not satisfy the second condition. They would form parasitic branches that <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> for their own replication but do not contribute to the system as a whole. However, it was noticed that such mutants do not pose a threat to the hypercycle, because other constituents of the hypercycle grow nonlinearly, which prevents the parasitic branches from growing.|$|E
25|$|The 3–3–1–3 {{was formed}} of a {{modification}} to the Dutch 4–3–3 system Ajax had developed. Coaches like Louis van Gaal and Johan Cruyff {{brought it to}} even further attacking extremes and the system eventually {{found its way to}} Barcelona, where players such as Andrés Iniesta and Xavi were reared into 3–3–1–3's philosophy. It demands intense pressing high up the pitch especially from the forwards, and also an extremely high defensive line, basically playing the whole game inside the opponents' half. It requires extreme technical precision and rapid ball circulation since one slip or dispossession can result in a vulnerable counter-attack situation. Cruyff's variant relied on a flatter and wider midfield, but Van Gaal used an offensive midfielder and midfield diamond to link up with the front three more effectively. Marcelo Bielsa has used the system with some success with Argentina's and Chile's national teams and is currently one of the few high-profile managers to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> in competition today.

500|$|The Aire and Calder Navigation is the canalised {{section of}} the Rivers Aire and Calder in West Yorkshire, England. The first {{improvements}} to the rivers above Knottingley were completed in 1704 when the Aire was made navigable to Leeds and the Calder to Wakefield, by the construction of 16 locks. Lock sizes were increased several times, as was the depth of water, to enable larger boats to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>system.</b> The Aire below Haddlesey was bypassed by {{the opening of the}} Selby Canal in 1778.

Subsequently, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in Fortran, Lisp, and machine language. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when the company went out of business. The following year, Information Sciences, Inc. hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in COBOL, providing them computer time and royalties. After his administrators became aware of his programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes. He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with [...] "a disproportionate number of interesting girls." [...] He later stated that [...] "it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success." [...] At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called Traf-O-Data, to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor.
