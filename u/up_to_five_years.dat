5|$|The {{obsolete}} destroyer , {{accompanied by}} 18 smaller craft, crossed the English Channel to the Atlantic coast of France and was rammed into the Normandie dock gates.

5|$|Michigan, led by {{the young}} and hot-headed Mason, responded {{with the passage of}} the Pains and Penalties Act just six days after Lucas County was formed; the act made it a {{criminal}} offense for Ohioans to carry out governmental actions in the Strip, under penalty of a fine up to $1,000, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> imprisonment at hard labor, or both. Acting as commander-in-chief of the territory, Mason appointed Brigadier-General Joseph W. Brown of the Third U.S. Brigade to head the state militia, with the instructions to be ready to act against Ohio trespassers. Lucas obtained legislative approval for a militia of his own, and he soon sent forces to the Strip area. The Toledo War had begun.|$|E

Section 107 allowed the secretary to issue regulations to put into force the Coinage Act of 1965, while section 108 contained definitions and similar technical matters.|$|E
5|$|The Grenztruppen {{were closely}} watched {{to ensure that}} they could not take {{advantage}} of their inside knowledge to escape across the border. Patrols, watchtowers and observation posts were always manned by two or three guards at a time. They were not allowed to go out of each other's sight in any circumstances. If a guard attempted to escape, his colleagues were under instructions to shoot him without hesitation or prior warning; 2,500 did escape to the West, 5,500 more were caught and imprisoned for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>years,</b> and a number were shot and killed or injured in the attempt.|$|E

A new parliament begins after an election of the House of Commons and can sit for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>years.</b> The number of seats in parliament has varied as new provinces joined the country and as population distribution between the provinces changed; there are currently 338 MPs and 105 Senators (when there are no vacancies).|$|E

5|$|The yellow-faced honeyeater breeds in monogamous pairs in a {{breeding}} season that extends from July to March, with migrating birds nesting later than sedentary birds. They nest solitarily in all-purpose territories that both parents defend against conspecifics {{and other species}} including thornbills, spinebills, and silvereyes, although the male is involved in more aggressive interactions than the female. Within {{a breeding}} season females lay two or three clutches of eggs, re-nesting with the same partner in the same territory.

5|$|Because {{the planet}} is {{predicted}} to be visible in the Northern Hemisphere, the primary search {{is expected to be}} carried out using the Subaru Telescope, which has both an aperture large enough to see faint objects and a wide field of view to shorten the search. Two teams of astronomers—Batygin and Brown, as well as Trujillo and Sheppard—are undertaking this search together, and both teams cooperatively expect the search to take <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>years.</b> Brown and Batygin initially narrowed the search for Planet Nine down to roughly 2,000 square degrees of sky near Orion, a swath of space, that in Batygin's opinion, could be covered in about 20 nights by the Subaru Telescope. Subsequent refinements by Batygin and Brown have reduced the search space to 600–800 square degrees of sky.|$|E
5|$|Most terns breed on open sandy or rocky {{areas on}} coasts and islands. The yellow-billed, large-billed, and black-fronted terns breed only on rivers, and common, least and little terns also {{sometimes}} use inland locations. The marsh terns, Trudeau's tern and some Forster's terns nest in inland marshes. The black noddy {{and the white}} tern nest above ground level on cliffs or in trees. Migratory terns move to the coast after breeding, and most species winter near land, although some marine species, like the Aleutian tern, may wander far from land. The sooty tern is entirely oceanic when not breeding, and healthy young birds are not seen on land for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> after fledging until they return to breed. They lack waterproof plumage, so they cannot rest on the sea. Where they spend the years prior to breeding is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{larval stage}} of dragonflies lasts <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> in large species, and between {{two months and}} three years in smaller species. When the naiad is ready to {{metamorphose}} into an adult, it stops feeding and makes {{its way to the}} surface, generally at night. It remains stationary with its head out of the water, while its respiration system adapts to breathing air, then climbs up a reed or other emergent plant, and moults (ecdysis). Anchoring itself firmly in a vertical position with its claws, its skin begins to split at a weak spot behind the head. The adult dragonfly crawls out of its larval skin, the exuvia, arching backwards when all but the tip of its abdomen is free, to allow its exoskeleton to harden. Curling back upwards, it completes its emergence, swallowing air, which plumps out its body, and pumping haemolymph into its wings, which causes them to expand to their full extent.|$|E
