5000|$|The {{response}} to the first installment of the Hector: Badge of Carnage trilogy of games has been extremely positive. The game has consistently {{been one of the}} best selling adventure games on the App Store and has an average customer rating of 4.5 Stars with over 500 reviews to date. The response from gaming review sites has also been very positive. AppSafari gave the game 5 out of 5 in their review, commenting that [...] "Hector is the gleefully unrefined anti-hero of one of the best point-and-click adventure games in the App Store." [...] Andrew Podolsky from SlideToPlay praised the cutscenes and the dialogue. AdventureGamers.com summarized its review: [...] "Stylish art and animation; fun puzzles; excellent production qualities all around; genuinely funny." [...] AppModo also praised the game as one which [...] "physically cannot be missed to iPod and iPhone <b>users.</b> It <b>is</b> <b>puzzling,</b> one of the funniest games on the App Store." ...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that spatial clustering patterns are scale-dependent. However, scale is still not explicitly handled in existing methods to detect clusters in spatial points; thus, <b>users</b> <b>are</b> often <b>puzzled</b> by the varied clustering results obtained by different spatial clustering methods and/or parameters. To handle the effect of scale on the cluster detection of spatial points, two kinds of scales are first specified in this study: scale of data and scale of analysis. These two kinds of scales are embodied {{by a set of}} three indictors: data resolution, spatial extent, and analysis resolution. Further, a scale-driven clustering model with these three scale indicators as parameters is statistically constructed based on the Natural Principle and graph theory. A comparative study of this scale-driven clustering model with existing methods is carried out with a simulated spatial dataset. It is found that only this new method is able to discover the multi-scale spatial clustering patterns defined in the benchmarks. Further, Carex lasiocarpa population data is used to illustrate the practical value of the proposed scale-driven clustering model. Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatic...|$|R
40|$|In {{discussions of}} metadata, {{the need for}} {{specific}} definitions often emerges. Usability tests of Web sites confirm this need. During such tests Energy Information Administration (EIA) staff members have found that <b>users</b> <b>are</b> often <b>puzzled</b> by our terminology [1]. While making a glossary of terms available sounds like a straightforward task, there are many issues involved. This paper discusses EIA’s experience in reconciling multiple definitions of the same terms. This is one step (albeit a major one); other steps necessary for {{the development and implementation}} of a glossary are also discussed. This paper concludes with a discussion of lessons learned in the process. EIA’s data definitions were originally developed for individual surveys so that survey respondents would report data correctly. EIA is now expanding its focus to data users and wants to ensure that customers understand EIA data and use the data appropriately. We, therefore, want definitions that the users will understand but that will also be appropriate for the respondents. The goal is to reach a broad audience consisting of survey respondents, technicallyoriented customers, the media, others of varying degrees of technical sophistication, international customers who will most likely reach us through the Web, and the general public...|$|R

40|$|We want {{to present}} here two simple systems {{developed}} {{to help people}} work in a multilingual environement. The first system allows one to perform searches in a multilingual document collection, whereas the second one helps understanding documents in foreign languages. These systems can be coupled together to provide a substantial aid to people working in a multilingual environment. 1 Introduction Cross language information retrieval (CLIR), also known as multilingual IR or trans-lingual IR, has received much attention in the last years, from both the research community and the industrial one. The challenge is to give a user access to the huge amount of textual data written in different languages, including, but not limited to, the user's mother tongue. Even though providing this access constitutes {{one of the first}} steps towards working in a multilingual environment, it may not be sufficient and the <b>user</b> may still <b>be</b> <b>puzzled</b> looking at a relevant text written in an unknown language, or [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Economists {{have long}} <b>been</b> <b>puzzled</b> by the {{observations}} that during peacetime industrial market economies display recurrent, large fluctuations in output and employment over {{relatively short time}} periods. Not uncommon are changes as large as 10 percent within {{only a couple of}} years. These observations <b>are</b> considered <b>puzzling</b> because the associated movements in labor's marginal product are small. These observations should not <b>be</b> <b>puzzling,</b> for they <b>are</b> what standard economic theory predicts. For the United States, in fact, given people's ability and willingness to intertemporally and intratemporally substitute consumption and leisure and given the nature of the changing production possibility set, it would <b>be</b> <b>puzzling</b> if the economy did not display these large fluctuation...|$|R
