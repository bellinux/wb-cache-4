5|$|To {{reach the}} chapel's ceiling, Michelangelo {{designed}} his own scaffold, a flat wooden platform on brackets built out from {{holes in the}} wall {{near the top of}} the windows, rather than being built <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Mancinelli speculates that this was in order to cut the cost of timber. According to Michelangelo's pupil and biographer Ascanio Condivi, the brackets and frame that supported the steps and flooring were all put in place at the beginning of the work and a lightweight screen, possibly cloth, was suspended beneath them to catch plaster drips, dust, and splashes of paint. Only half the building was scaffolded at a time and the platform was moved as the painting was done in stages. The areas of the wall covered by the scaffolding still appear as unpainted areas across the bottom of the lunettes. The holes were re-used to hold scaffolding in the latest restoration.|$|E

Several weeks later, one of his limbs {{was said to have}} risen <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> making the mobsters dig a deeper grave. Years later, Anthony Basile was indicted on drug trafficking charges; Salvatore Vitale and Joseph Massino feared Anthony would become an informant and reveal Perrino's gravesite. His remains were removed from the cement floor and buried again.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of February 25, 1855, Baker entered the Stanwix Hall saloon with Jim Turner and Paudeen McLaughlin to confront Poole having {{threatened}} Morrissey with a gun during an argument only hours before. Walking up to Poole, Baker spat {{in his face and}} then pulled a Colt revolver but accidentally shot himself in the arm as he stepped back to draw the weapon. Dropping to the floor, he did manage to fire a second shot hitting Poole in the leg and similarly incapacitating him. Both men eventually got <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> however Baker managed to get to Poole first and pistol whipped him back to the ground. Baker then shot Poole twice, once in the stomach and the second in his chest, and left the saloon.|$|E
500|$|Divine became {{increasingly}} known for outlandish stunts onstage, each {{time trying to}} outdo {{what he had done}} before. At one performance in London's Hippodrome coinciding with American Independence Day, Divine rose <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> on a hydraulic lift, draped in the American flag, and declared: [...] "I'm here representing Freedom, Liberty, Family Values, and the fucking American Way of Life." [...] When he performed at the London Gay Pride parade, he sang on the roof of a hired pleasure boat that floated down the Thames past Jubilee Gardens. At a performance Divine gave at the Hippodrome {{in the last year of}} his life, he appeared onstage riding an infant elephant which had been hired for the occasion. Divine was nevertheless not happy with being known primarily for his drag act, and told an interviewer that [...] "my favorite part of drag is getting out of it. Drag is my work clothes. I only put it on when someone pays me to", a view he echoed to his friends.|$|E
2500|$|Of several 299 {{games that}} were bowled on {{televised}} championships, {{the most memorable}} occurred on April 4, 1970 when Don Johnson defeated Dick Ritger to win the 1970 Firestone Tournament of Champions at Riviera Lanes in Fairlawn, Ohio. [...] With 11 strikes already down, he threw his 12th ball, stepped back and dropped to the floor. [...] The ball hit the pocket, but the 10-pin remained standing. [...] Johnson, still on the floor, briefly lowered his face into his hands, then stood up to a thunderous ovation. Johnson's wife Mary Anne was also crying prior to the shot, and crying even more after Johnson got <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Along with the trophy and $25,000 check from Firestone, Johnson also received the 10-pin that denied him both an extra $10,000 and a new Mercury Cougar automobile for a perfect game (In the post-match interview with the Johnsons, Mary Anne was holding the pin). [...] The footage {{of this has been}} replayed many dozens of times in flashback segments on PBA telecasts. The online bowling channel Xtra Frame has named this the most memorable moment of the events history.|$|E

2500|$|Whut? Thee Album {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} music critics upon its release. Entertainment Weeklys James Bernard gave the album an A- rating, {{and called it}} [...] "engaging, hilarious, bargain-basement funk that doesn't care what you think". In its November 1992 issue, The Source magazine rated it 4½ out of 5 [...] "mics", with writer Matty C declaring the album as living up to the expectations it accumulated in the previous year. Although he was un-favorable of its skits, he praised the album's [...] "funky" [...] production, and Redman's charismatic lyrics and flow, stating [...] "...not only has he mastered the laid back, homicidal flow, but he can also have you picking yourself <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> from his hysterical punchlines". In his review for The Washington Post, Gil Griffin wrote [...] "EPMD produced this album and give it their trademark, thick hard funky stamp, while Redman kicks it with his deep, convincing voice, likening himself to a psycho, a lover and a fighter. The booming drums come in extra handy on [...] "Blow Your Mind," [...] "Time 4 Sum Aksion" [...] and [...] "So Ruff," [...] where he flows with free-style rhymes".|$|E
2500|$|The {{entrance}} to Derrick cave {{appears as a}} large broken-face hole in the ground. From its mouth, the entrance leads to a wide lava tube. The lava tube runs in two directions from the entrance cleft, northeast and southwest. The north cave is relatively small. This is {{the area where the}} civil defense shelter was once located. The main section of the cave runs gradually downhill in a southwestly direction from the entrance. In this area of the lava tube, the floor is covered by volcanic sand. Over the centuries, the ceiling has collapsed in several areas of the cave, creating natural skylights. The collapsed ceiling rock rests in large boulder piles on the cave floor. The sunlight from these holes is sufficient to allow trees to grow <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of the cave through the openings in the ceiling. Visitors do not need lamps or flashlights to enjoy this section of the cave. In this area, the cave is about [...] wide. Beyond the last skylight, the cave is dark and artificial light is required. After a short walk, the cave opens into a large room [...] wide with a ceiling that reaches a height of [...] This area is known as the Big Room. In the Big Room and beyond, the lava flow’s current can be seen molded in the tunnel walls. They appear as rounded over-hanging shelves and lateral markings etched in the walls. In places, there are also [...] lavacicles hanging from the ceiling. These formations were created after the lava had drained out of the tube leaving superheated gases trapped in the lava tube. The hot gases melted the walls of the lava tube causing drips to form. As the gas cooled, the remaining drips hardened into lavacicles.|$|E
