5|$|The {{earliest}} known coins of the Western {{world were}} minted {{in the kingdom}} of Lydia in Asia Minor around 600 BC. The coins of Lydia were made of electrum, which is a naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver, that was available within the territory of Lydia. Since that time, silver standards, in which the standard economic <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> is a fixed weight of silver, have been widespread throughout the world until the 20th century. Notable silver coins through the centuries include the Greek drachma, the Roman denarius, the Islamic dirham, the Indian rupee {{from the time of the}} Mughal Empire (grouped with copper and gold coins to create a trimetallic standard), and the Spanish dollar.|$|E
25|$|No penny is {{currently}} formally subdivided, although farthings (¼d.), halfpennies, and half cents have previously been minted and the mill (1/10¢) remains in {{use as a}} <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> in some contexts.|$|E
25|$|Since 28 November 1912 until 1926 the Albanian {{government}} did not mint any currency. Transactions occurred in gold and silver coins of other countries, whereas the official <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> was the franc of the Latin Monetary Union.|$|E

The Florentine gold florin, the French franc and the electoral rheingulden all became pounds (240 denari) <b>of</b> <b>account.</b> <b>Units</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> would often survive over 100 years despite the original coins changing composition and availability (e.g. the Castilian maravedi).|$|R
25|$|The ERM {{is based}} on the concept of fixed {{currency}} exchange rate margins, but with exchange rates variable within those margins. This is also known as a semi-pegged system. Before the introduction of the euro, exchange rates were based on the European Currency Unit (ECU), the European <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>account,</b> whose value was determined as a weighted average of the participating currencies.|$|E
25|$|The pataca was {{introduced}} in Portuguese Macau and Portuguese Timor in the year 1894, but only as a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>account.</b> The unit initially corresponded to the Mexican dollar, and it replaced the Portuguese real {{at a rate of}} 1 pataca = 450 reais. The name pataca derives {{from the fact that the}} Portuguese always referred to the Mexican dollar as the pataca mexicana.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the pound}} {{sterling}} formerly {{was divided into}} twenty shillings, and it was normal to consider the shilling to be a subsidiary unit of the pound. In British East Africa, however, even though twenty shillings were equal in value to one pound sterling, the shilling was always considered the primary <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>account.</b> This state of affairs was unique amongst all {{the parts of the}} British Empire that used the pound sterling currency.|$|E

We propose a definition, rooted in economic principles, <b>of</b> ecosystem service <b>units.</b> A goal <b>of</b> these <b>units</b> is comparability with the definition of conventional goods and services found in GDP and the other national accounts. We illustrate our definition <b>of</b> ecological <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> with concrete examples. We also argue that these same <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> provide an architecture for environmental performance measurement by governments, conservancies, and environmental markets...|$|R

50|$|The {{official}} {{use of the}} livre tournois {{accounting unit}} in all contracts in France was legislated in 1549, {{but it had been}} one <b>of</b> the standard <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> in France since the 13th century. In 1577 the livre tournois accounting unit was officially abolished and accountants switched to the écu, which was at that time the major French gold coin in actual circulation, but in 1602 the livre tournois accounting unit was brought back. (A monetary <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> based on the livre parisis continued to be used for minor uses in and around Paris and was not officially abolished until 1667 by Louis XIV).|$|R
25|$|Conversion to the decimal {{system with}} the peso fuerte (Spanish for strong peso) as the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> solved the {{accounting}} problem, but did little to remedy the confusion of differing circulating coinage. Renewed calls for the Philippine Islands to have a proper mint and monetary system finally came to fruition in September 1857, when Queen Isabel II authorized {{the creation of the}} Casa de Moneda de Manila and purchase of required machinery. The mint was inaugurated on March 19, 1861.|$|E
25|$|The Isabelline peso, more {{formally}} {{known as}} the peso fuerte, was a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> divided into 100 céntimos (equivalent to 8 reales fuertes or 80 reales de vellón). Its introduction led to the Philippines' brief experiment with the gold standard, which would not again be attempted until the American colonial period. The peso fuerte was also a unit of exchange equivalent to 1.69grams of gold, 0.875 fine (0.0476 XAU), equivalent to ₱1,390.87 (refers to the modern peso; as of September 2015).|$|E
25|$|Phase 1 of the {{monetary}} union process {{was scheduled to}} conclude in 1996. It was to include the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, the OECS states and Trinidad and Tobago and there {{was to have been}} a common currency as a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> (cf. the Euro from 1999–2002) amongst these states {{with the exception of the}} Bahamas and Belize. This phase would also involve the coordination of monetary policies and the movement towards intra-regional currency convertibility among all member states. Phase 1 would also have seen the formation of a Council of CARICOM Central Bank Governors to oversee the entire process.|$|E
50|$|The livre (pound) was the {{currency}} of Kingdom of France and its predecessor state of West Francia from 781 to 1794. Several different livres existed, some concurrently. The livre was the name <b>of</b> both <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> and coins.|$|R
50|$|The classic {{formulation}} of socialism involved replacing {{the criteria of}} value from money (exchange-value) to physical utility (use-value), to be quantified in terms of physical quantities (Calculation in kind and Input-Output analysis) or some natural <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting,</b> such as energy accounting.|$|R
50|$|Due to this {{inherent}} fragility, {{which is}} even more profound with electronic voting, some economists argue that <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> should not ever be abstracted or confused with the nominal units or tokens used in exchange.

25|$|In {{most major}} economies using coinage, copper, {{silver and gold}} formed three tiers of coins. Gold coins were used for large purchases, payment of the {{military}} and backing of state activities. Silver coins were used for midsized transactions, and as a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> for taxes, dues, contracts and fealty, while copper coins represented the coinage of common transaction. This system had been used in ancient India since the time of the Mahajanapadas. In Europe, this system worked through the medieval period because there was virtually no new gold, silver or copper introduced through mining or conquest. Thus the overall ratios of the three coinages remained roughly equivalent.|$|E
25|$|Voting {{power in}} the IMF {{is based on a}} quota system. Each member has a number of basic votes (each member's number of basic votes equals 5.502% of the total votes), plus one {{additional}} vote for each Special Drawing Right (SDR) of 100,000 of a member country's quota. The Special Drawing Right is the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> of the IMF and represents a claim to currency. It is based on a basket of key international currencies. The basic votes generate a slight bias in favour of small countries, but the additional votes determined by SDR outweigh this bias. Changes in the voting shares require approval by a supermajority of 85% of voting power.|$|E
25|$|A {{final step}} {{can be taken}} in {{relating}} the composite good to a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> such as money by setting {{the price of the}} composite good to 1. Since the prices of all other goods are known, the composite good can be converted into any combination of bundles that represent the optimal choice other than the first good. This final step clarifies the relation of the model to the real world where many goods can be stated in terms of money value. In John R. Hicks's classic Value and Capital (1939), a composite good was used to generalize mathematically from consumer demand equilibrium for an individual in the 2-good case to market equilibrium via supply and demand in the n-good case.|$|E
50|$|In {{absolute}} terms, exchange values {{can also}} be measured as quantities of average labour-hours. By contrast, prices are normally measured in money-units. For practical purposes, prices are however usually preferable to labour-hours, as <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>account,</b> although in capitalist work processes the two are {{related to each other}} (see labor power).|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{professionals}} in Great Britain received a fee in contradistinction to a payment, salary, or wage, and would often use guineas rather than pounds as <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>account.</b> Under the feudal system, a Knight's fee {{was what was}} given to a knight for his service, usually the usage of land.|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{extension}} of the constant-returns-equivalent (CRE) solution for allocating joint costs/benefits among homogeneous contributors to environments in which contributors are heterogeneous. For the domain of quasilinear economies, we axiomatically characterize this solution by means of three axioms: efficiency, free access to linear economies, and a weak version of technological monotonicity which considers the different roles of the agents in generating the costs.

25|$|These factors led to {{the shift}} of the store of value being the metal itself: at first silver, then both silver and gold, {{and at one point}} there was bronze as well. Now we have copper coins and other non-precious metals as coins. Metals were mined, weighed, and stamped into coins. This was to assure the {{individual}} taking the coin that he was getting a certain known weight of precious metal. Coins could be counterfeited, but they also created a new <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>account,</b> which helped lead to banking. Archimedes' principle provided the next link: coins could now be easily tested for their fine weight of metal, and thus the value of a coin could be determined, even if it had been shaved, debased or otherwise tampered with (see Numismatics).|$|E
25|$|By about 140 BC (the exact date is unclear) the denarius was retariffed to 16 asses, {{indicated}} by XVI on the obverse of the denarius. This appears {{first on the}} coinage marked L.IVLI (Crawford 224/1), commonly dated to 141 BC The clear marking with the number XVI was soon again replaced with an X, but often now with a horizontal bar through the centre {{as shown in the}} second example on the left (Crawford 243/1); this is often read as a monogram of XVI with all the letters superimposed. The re-tariffing is thought to have been a recognition of a relationship that had developed because of decreased as weights, both due to wear of old asses and to decreasing mint weights of newer ones. This meant that the quinarius was worth eight asses, and the sestertius four asses. The new denarius-to-as ratio lasted for hundreds of years. At about the same time the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> changed from asses to sestertii (HS). This may well be an indicator of inflation.|$|E
25|$|Many items {{have been}} used as {{commodity}} money such as naturally scarce precious metals, conch shells, barley, beads etc., as well as many other things that are thought of as having value. Commodity money value comes from the commodity out of which it is made. The commodity itself constitutes the money, and the money is the commodity. Examples of commodities that {{have been used}} as mediums of exchange include gold, silver, copper, rice, Wampum, salt, peppercorns, large stones, decorated belts, shells, alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis, candy, etc. These items were sometimes used in a metric of perceived value in conjunction to one another, in various commodity valuation or price system economies. Use of commodity money is similar to barter, but a commodity money provides a simple and automatic <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> for the commodity which is being used as money. Although some gold coins such as the Krugerrand are considered legal tender, there is no record of their face value {{on either side of the}} coin. The rationale for this is that emphasis is laid on their direct link to the prevailing value of their fine gold content.|$|E
5000|$|Neo-Chartalists argue however that, {{although}} {{we will never}} be certain, for lack of definite archaeological proofs, about the origins of money, the first instances <b>of</b> <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> are debt markets, the so-called [...] "tally sticks" [...] in antiquity. Money issued is always debt issued, and, therefore, the notion that money originated as a means of exchange first is regarded as false.|$|R

500|$|The {{new system}} is not founded on free-trade (liberalisation of foreign trade) but rather on the {{regulation}} of international trade, in order to eliminate trade imbalances: the nations with a surplus would {{have an incentive to}} reduce it, and in doing so they would automatically clear other nations deficits. He proposed a global bank that would issue its own currency - the bancor - which was exchangeable with national currencies at fixed rates of exchange and would become the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> between nations, which means it would be used to measure a country's trade deficit or trade surplus. Every country would have an overdraft facility in its bancor account at the International Clearing Union.

40|$|In the {{prevailing}} theory of economic equilibrium with incomplete markets, assets pay in “units <b>of</b> <b>account</b> ” which {{are regarded as}} money but have no connection with the actual currencies that rule in financial dealings.

In consequence, there is a serious indeterminancy in prices which precludes inflationary comparisons and the handling of multiple curriences with market-generated exchange rates. Here, a model is developed that remedies these shortcomings through innovations in “goods ” and the way agents can get utility from them. A new approach to time, states, and prices helps by loosening the grip of perfect foresight in the interpretation of future spot markets. A single currency, which can be fiat money, denominates all <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>account.</b> Such money, as a special “good, ” is supported in value by the utility agents attach to retaining it.
