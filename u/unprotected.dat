5|$|In a lesser-known tale in the Ganesha Purana (9001400CE) {{the wise}} asura king Virochana is rewarded a magical crown by the sun-god Surya. The crown shields him against all harm. Vishnu as Mohini then enchants Virochana and steals his crown. The demon, thus <b>unprotected,</b> is killed by Vishnu.|$|E
5|$|In the 1880s and 1890s, Germany built nine <b>unprotected</b> cruisers {{in three}} classes. These ships {{proved to be}} {{transitional}} designs, and experience gathered with them {{and a series of}} avisos helped to produce the first light cruisers of the German Navy. The <b>unprotected</b> cruisers, generally designed for service in Germany's colonial empire, required great endurance and relatively heavy firepower. The first ships of the type, the two s, were acquired in an effort to modernize an aged cruiser force that relied primarily on old sail frigates. The new ships were primarily steam-powered but retained auxiliary sailing rigs. The second design, the , was larger than the Schwalbe class and mounted newer, quick-firing guns, but was otherwise generally similar in capabilities. , the final cruiser of the type, represented an attempt to merge the requirements for a colonial cruiser with those for a fleet scout as a result of Germany's chronically small naval budget; the design was unsatisfactory, and rather than continuing to build <b>unprotected</b> cruisers, German naval designers began work on the , the first modern light cruiser of the German Navy.|$|E
5|$|Larry Ball and Doug Swift of the undefeated 1972 Miami Dolphins team. Swift {{was left}} <b>unprotected</b> by the Dolphins, and the Buccaneers drafted him, {{unaware of the}} {{previous}} day’s newspaper report that Swift had been accepted into medical school and would be retiring from football.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of sambutoxin reported by David Williams uses a novel Saegusa–Ito oxidation involving an <b>unprotected</b> enol moiety. The enone product cyclized in situ to regenerate the enol and form the tetrahydropyran ring. Subsequent deprotection of the methoxymethyl group furnished the natural product.|$|E
5|$|Three more {{individuals}} {{who say they}} had <b>unprotected</b> sex with Usher sued him on allegations of fraud, sexual battery, infliction of emotional distress and more, alleging that he was positive for the herpes virus and didn't tell them in advance. All three are represented by attorney Lisa Bloom who said {{at the news conference}} on 8 August 2017 that one of her three clients had contracted genital herpes allegedly from Usher. One of the accusers, Quantasia Sharpton, said she had <b>unprotected</b> sex with him after a concert she attended around her 19th birthday. The other two accusers, one male, one female, preferred to remain anonymous plaintiffs. Sharpton admitted she tested negative for herpes and Bloom stated she didn't know if the singer had the disease.|$|E
5|$|Using devices {{drawn from}} modern {{experimental}} theatre, Serbian playwright Nebojša Pajkić {{has written a}} stage production about Ljotić's life titled Ljotić. Stock footage of Ljotić attending the funeral of a fallen SDK member is featured in Dušan Makavejev's 1968 film Innocence <b>Unprotected.</b>|$|E
5|$|A prostitute is {{available}} {{as soon as}} the game starts. Should Larry have <b>unprotected</b> intercourse with her, he will contract a sexually-transmitted disease and die shortly thereafter. This fate may be avoided by buying a condom at the convenience store. Larry questions the validity of losing his virginity to a prostitute, but the game resumes without a time limit.|$|E
5|$|By August 3, Colonel Warren {{concluded}} the entire effort was futile and dangerous. The <b>unprotected</b> sailors were stirring up radioactive material and contaminating their skin, clothing, and, presumably, their lungs. When {{they returned to}} their support ship living quarters, they contaminated the shower stalls, laundry facilities, and everything they touched. Warren demanded an immediate halt to the entire cleanup operation. He was especially concerned about plutonium, which was undetectable on site.|$|E
5|$|Despite heavy weathering, {{the ditch}} is still visible in short sections, {{which can be}} 45yards wide and up to 5feet deep. A 330-yard stretch through Denton Golf Course, and a section running through Platt Fields Park, are {{considered}} the best preserved remains. In 1997, {{a segment of the}} ditch 150-yard long in Platt Fields was protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The rest of the ditch remains <b>unprotected.</b>|$|E
5|$|Even {{after two}} operations, Bure {{did not play}} in 2003–04 due to the {{lingering}} effects of the knee injury. He failed a pre-season physical and was declared medically unable to play. Left with his fully insured $10million salary (80 percent {{of which would be}} reimbursed to the team), the Rangers left him <b>unprotected</b> in the NHL's Waiver Draft, where he was unclaimed.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Tech {{students}} took the Wreck to Athens {{for the annual}} football game with UGA. After the game, the Wreck's police escort abandoned the car. The vehicle appeared relatively <b>unprotected</b> and was approached by UGA students attempting to vandalize it. The Tech students responsible for the car's safekeeping frightened the encroaching Bulldog fans away by producing a concealed 9 mm pistol.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} after the storm, many {{insurance}} companies left Hawaii. To combat this, State Governor John D. Waihee III enacted the Hurricane Relief Fund in 1993 to help <b>unprotected</b> Hawaii residents. The fund was never needed for another Hawaii hurricane, and it was stopped in 2000 when insurance companies returned to the island.|$|E
5|$|Kitti's hog-nosed bat {{occupies}} limestone caves along rivers within dry evergreen or deciduous forests. In Thailand, Kitti's hog-nosed bat {{is restricted}} to a small region of the Tenasserim Hills in Sai Yok District, Kanchanaburi Province, within the drainage basin of the Khwae Noi River. While Sai Yok National Park in the Dawna Hills contains much of the bat's range, some Thai populations occur outside the park and are therefore <b>unprotected.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meanders are sinuous bends in rivers {{or other}} channels, which form as a fluid, most often water, flows around bends. As {{soon as the}} path is {{slightly}} curved, the size and curvature of each loop increases as helical flow drags material like sand and gravel across the river {{to the inside of}} the bend. The outside of the loop is left clean and <b>unprotected,</b> so erosion accelerates, further increasing the meandering in a powerful positive feedback loop.|$|E
5|$|Olmstead won {{two more}} Stanley Cups in the 1956–57 and 1957–58 seasons. After the {{conclusion}} of the 1957–58 seasons, doctors informed him that he had no strength left in his knees, and that he should contemplate retirement. As a result of this prognosis, the Canadiens left Olmstead <b>unprotected</b> in the Intra-League Draft, and he was claimed by Billy Reay, the head coach of the Canadiens' chief rival, the Toronto Maple Leafs.|$|E
5|$|On October 20, 2015, the Orlando Pride officially {{became the}} tenth {{team in the}} National Women's Soccer League. Shortly after, the Washington Spirit {{announced}} {{that they would be}} leaving Harris <b>unprotected</b> for the 2015 Expansion Draft, giving the Orlando Pride the opportunity to select Harris for their roster for the 2016 season. On November 2, the Pride selected Harris with their second pick in the 2015 Expansion Draft.|$|E
5|$|Realignment of the River Glaven {{means the}} ruins are {{now to the}} north of the river embankment, and {{essentially}} <b>unprotected</b> from coastal erosion, since the advancing shingle will no longer be swept away by the stream. The chapel will be buried by a ridge of shingle as the spit continues to move south, and then lost to the sea, perhaps within 20–30years.|$|E
5|$|Rockwell workers mixed {{hazardous}} {{and other}} wastes with concrete to create one-ton solid blocks called pondcrete. These were {{stored in the}} open under tarps on asphalt pads. The pondcrete {{turned out to be}} weak storage, an outcome that had been predicted by Rockwell's own engineers. Relatively <b>unprotected</b> from the elements, the blocks began to leak and sag. Nitrates, cadmium and low-level radioactive waste began to leach into the ground and run downhill toward Walnut Creek and Woman Creek.|$|E
5|$|Several older star {{players who}} were left <b>unprotected,</b> {{including}} Danny Tartabull, Jack Morris, and Shawon Dunston, were not selected due to their high salaries and advanced age. Based {{on the results of}} the expansion draft, the Marlins were projected to have a higher payroll in 1993 than the Rockies. The Rockies' payroll appeared to be $4 million, less than what the Marlins would pay Bryan Harvey.|$|E
5|$|The Athenian {{commanders in}} Corinth, Iphicrates, who {{commanded}} the peltasts, and Callias, who commanded the hoplites, saw that an entire Spartan mora, or regiment, of 600 men was marching past the city <b>unprotected</b> by either peltasts or cavalry, {{and decided to}} take advantage of this fact. Accordingly, the Athenian hoplites drew up a little outside Corinth, while the peltasts went after the Spartan force in pursuit, flinging javelins at the Spartan hoplites.|$|E
5|$|The city of Arcadia in DeSoto County saw extreme damage, {{in spite}} of being {{relatively}} further inland. About 95% of the buildings {{in the downtown area}} saw some sort of damage. The only shelter in the town had its roof torn open by the wind, leaving 3,500 evacuees inside <b>unprotected</b> from the onslaught of the storm.|$|E
5|$|After {{several years}} of {{comparatively}} weak government under the Articles of Confederation, a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed a new constitution on September 17, 1787, featuring a stronger chief executive and other changes. George Mason, a Constitutional Convention delegate and the drafter of Virginia's Declaration of Rights, proposed that {{a bill of rights}} listing and guaranteeing civil liberties be included. Other delegatesincluding future Bill of Rights drafter James Madisondisagreed, arguing that existing state guarantees of civil liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate individual rights risked the implication that other, unnamed rights were <b>unprotected.</b> After a brief debate, Mason's proposal was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Kingdom of Bosnia into the Ottoman hands in 1463, the {{southern}} and central parts of the Kingdom of Croatia remained <b>unprotected,</b> the defense of which was left to Croatian gentry who kept smaller troops in the fortified border areas at their own expense. Decisive Ottoman victory at the Battle of Krbava field in 1493, shook all of Croatia. However, it did not dissuade the Croats from making more decisive and persistent attempts at defending themselves against the attacks of the much larger enemy. A new wave of Ottoman conquest began in 1521, after which a good portion of Croatia was conquered or pillaged.|$|E
5|$|All <b>unprotected</b> MLB {{and minor}} league players were {{eligible}} except those chosen in the amateur drafts of 1991 or 1992 and {{players who were}} 18 or younger when signed in 1990. Players who were free agents after the 1992 season were not eligible for selection in the draft. The Colorado Rockies and Florida Marlins, however, were not restricted in offering contracts to free agents. The Rockies signed their first free agent, Andrés Galarraga, to a one-year contract {{the day before the}} expansion draft.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} cordite handling, {{the battle was}} mostly inconclusive, though both the British {{flagship}} Lion and Seydlitz were severely damaged. Lion lost speed, causing her to fall behind {{the rest of the}} battleline, and Beatty was unable to effectively command his ships {{for the remainder of the}} engagement. A British signalling error allowed the German battlecruisers to withdraw, as most of Beatty's squadron mistakenly concentrated on the crippled armoured cruiser Blücher, sinking her with great loss of life. The British blamed their failure to win a decisive victory on their poor gunnery and attempted to increase their rate of fire by stockpiling <b>unprotected</b> cordite charges in their ammunition hoists and barbettes.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First World War, the Egyptian police controlling the Sinai Peninsula had withdrawn, leaving the area largely <b>unprotected.</b> In February 1915, a German and Ottoman force unsuccessfully attacked the Suez Canal. Minor Ottoman and Bedouin forces operating across the Sinai continued to threaten the canal from March through the Gallipoli Campaign until June, when they practically ceased until the autumn. Meanwhile, the German and Ottoman Empires supported an uprising by the Senussi (a political-religious group) on the western frontier of Egypt which began in November 1915.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time that Caprivi began {{ordering}} new protected cruisers, he also authorized the construction of smaller <b>unprotected</b> cruisers for use in Germany's overseas colonies. The first of these, the , were laid down in 1886 and 1887. A further six vessels of the , which were improved versions that were larger and faster than their predecessors, followed over the next five years. A final, much larger vessel, , was laid down in 1892; her design was based on contemporary protected cruisers like Kaiserin Augusta. She represented another attempt to merge the colonial cruiser and fleet scout, which was unsuccessful. As a result, the German naval designers began work on the , which provided the basis for all future German light cruisers.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede {{also has}} polar caps, likely {{composed}} of water frost. The frost extends to 40° latitude. These polar caps were first {{seen by the}} Voyager spacecraft. Theories on {{the formation of the}} caps include the migration of water to higher latitudes and bombardment of the ice by plasma. Data from Galileo suggests the latter is correct. The presence of a magnetic field on Ganymede results in more intense charged particle bombardment of its surface in the <b>unprotected</b> polar regions; sputtering then leads to redistribution of water molecules, with frost migrating to locally colder areas within the polar terrain.|$|E
5|$|General {{anesthesia}} {{is often}} administered without tracheal intubation in selected {{cases where the}} procedure is brief in duration, or procedures where the depth of anesthesia {{is not sufficient to}} cause significant compromise in ventilatory function. Even for longer duration or more invasive procedures, a general anesthetic may be administered without intubating the trachea, provided that patients are carefully selected, and the risk-benefit ratio is favorable (i.e., the risks associated with an <b>unprotected</b> airway are believed to be less than the risks of intubating the trachea).|$|E
5|$|HIV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by <b>unprotected</b> sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating {{those who are}} infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow {{the course of the}} disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11years.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{typically}} transmitted through <b>unprotected</b> sex or intravenous drug use, {{and is often}} associated with groups such as promiscuous gay men, illicit drug users, and sex workers. For these reasons, and also because of fears of contagion, people living with HIV are frequently subjected to stigma and discrimination. Publicity campaigns around the world have aimed to counter HIV-related prejudices and misconceptions and to replace them with an accurate understanding that helps to prevent new infections. These efforts have been aided by various celebrities – including American basketball star Magic Johnson and South African judge Edwin Cameron – who have publicly announced that they are HIV-positive.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, her {{daughter}} Irène was born. To support her family, Curie began {{teaching at the}} École Normale Supérieure. The Curies {{did not have a}} dedicated laboratory; most of their research was carried out in a converted shed next to the School of Physics and Chemistry. The shed, formerly a medical school dissecting room, was poorly ventilated and not even waterproof. They were unaware of the deleterious effects of radiation exposure attendant on their continued <b>unprotected</b> work with radioactive substances. The School did not sponsor her research, but she would receive subsidies from metallurgical and mining companies and from various organizations and governments.|$|E
