25|$|If a {{regulator}} stage has {{an architecture}} that compensates {{for a change}} of <b>upstream</b> <b>pressure</b> on the moving parts of the valve so that a change in supply pressure does not affect the force required to open the valve, the stage is described as balanced. Upstream and downstream valves, first and second stages, and diaphragm and piston operation can be balanced or unbalanced, and a full description of a stage will specify which of all of these options apply. For example a regulator may have a balanced piston first stage with a balanced downstream second stage. Both balanced and unbalanced piston first stages are fairly common, but most diaphragm first stages are balanced. Balancing the first stage has a greater overall affect on thr performance of a regulator, as the variation in supply pressure from the cylinder is much greater than the variation in interstage pressure, even with an unbalanced first stage. However the second stage operates on very a small pressure differential and is more sensitive to variations in supply pressure. Most top range regulators have at least one balanced stage, {{but it is not clear}} that balancing both stages makes a noticeable difference to performance.|$|E

Recent economic policy and academic literature insists on {{the negative effects of}} product market regulation on productivity or innovation, and hence on “competitiveness", a term that we interpret as the ability to export. Similar to the conclusions of some contributions to a recent literature on competition and growth, the “common sense ” is that product market regulation should be detrimental to competitiveness. Testing through a two-step estimation {{the impact of}} <b>upstream</b> <b>pressures</b> of product market regulation on productivity and the effect of the latter on the propensity to export, this paper shows that <b>upstream</b> regulatory <b>pressures</b> have a significantly positive impact on productivity and thereby on the capability of an industry to attract resources and to sell its production in international markets...|$|R

50|$|Choked flow is a fluid dynamic {{condition}} {{associated with the}} Venturi effect. When a flowing fluid at a given pressure and temperature passes through a restriction (such as the throat of a convergent-divergent nozzle or a valve in a pipe) into a lower pressure environment the fluid velocity increases. At initially subsonic upstream conditions, the conservation of mass principle requires the fluid velocity to increase as it flows through the smaller cross-sectional area of the restriction. At the same time, the Venturi effect causes the static pressure, and therefore the density, to decrease downstream beyond the restriction. Choked flow is a limiting condition where the mass flow will not increase with a further decrease in the downstream pressure environment while <b>upstream</b> <b>pressure</b> is fixed. Note that the limited parameter is velocity, and thus mass flow can be increased with increased <b>upstream</b> <b>pressure</b> (increased fluid density).|$|E
40|$|The {{cavitation}} phenomenon inside micro- and minichannel configurations was numerically investigated. The simulations {{for each}} channel were performed at different <b>upstream</b> <b>pressures</b> varying from 1 to 15 MPa. Two microchannel configurations with inner diameters of 152 and 254 mu m and two minichannel configurations with inner diameters of 504 and 762 mu m were simulated. To validate the numerical approach, micro-jet impingement from a microchannel with an inner diameter of 152 mu m was first simulated at different Reynolds numbers. Then, the mixture model was used to model the multiphase flow inside the channels. The {{results of this study}} present major differences in the cavitating flows between the micro- and miniscale channels and show that the pressure profile and vapor phase distribution exhibit different features. The static pressure drops to negative values (tensile stress) in microchannels, while the minimum static pressure in minichannels is found to be equal to vapor saturation pressure, and higher velocity magnitudes especially at the outlet are visible in the microchannels. It is shown that for higher <b>upstream</b> <b>pressures,</b> the cavitating flow extends over the length of the micro/minichannel, thereby increasing the possibility of collapse at the outlet. The effect of energy associated with turbulence was investigated at high Reynolds numbers for both micro/minichannels and its impact was analyzed using wall shear stress, turbulence kinetic energy and mean velocity at various locations of the micro/minichannels...|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} system of active {{addition}} of make-up gas in semi-closed rebreathers is {{by use of}} a constant mass flow injector, also known as choked flow. This is easily achieved by using a sonic orifice, as provided the pressure drop over the orifice is sufficient to ensure sonic flow, the mass flow for a specific gas will be independent of the downstream pressure. The mass flow through a sonic orifice {{is a function of}} the <b>upstream</b> <b>pressure</b> and the gas mixture, so the <b>upstream</b> <b>pressure</b> must remain constant for the working depth range of the rebreather to provide a reliably predictable mixture in the breathing circuit, and a modified regulator is used which is not affected by changes in ambient pressure. Gas addition is independent of oxygen use, and the gas fraction in the loop is strongly dependent on exertion of the diver - it is possible to dangerously deplete the oxygen by excessive physical exertion.|$|E
50|$|The <b>upstream</b> <b>{{pressure}}</b> {{tries to}} push the piston open but it is opposed by that same pressure because the pressure is routed around to the dome above the piston. The area of the piston on which fluid force is acting is larger in the dome than {{it is on the}} upstream side; the result is a larger force on the dome side than the upstream side. This produces a net sealing force.|$|E
50|$|Constant {{mass flow}} is {{achieved}} by sonic flow through an orifice. The flow of a compressible fluid through an orifice {{is limited to the}} flow at sonic velocity in the orifice. This can be controlled by the <b>upstream</b> <b>pressure</b> and the orifice size and shape, but once the flow reached the speed of sound in the orifice, any further reduction of downstream pressure has no influence on the flow rate. This requires a gas source at a fixed pressure, and it only works at depths which have a low enough ambient pressure to provide sonic flow in the orifice.|$|E

50|$|Although many {{2-way valves}} {{are made in}} which the flow can go in either {{direction}} between the two ports, when a valve is placed into a certain application, flow is often expected to go from one certain port on the upstream side of the valve, to the other port on the downstream side. Pressure regulators are variations of valves in which flow is controlled to produce a certain downstream pressure, if possible. They are often used to control flow of gas from a gas cylinder. A back-pressure regulator is a variation of a valve in which flow is controlled to maintain a certain <b>upstream</b> <b>pressure,</b> if possible.|$|E
50|$|Most {{piston engines}} have a hot exhaust that still {{contains}} considerable undeveloped energy {{that could be}} used for propulsion if extracted. A turbine is often used to extract energy from such a stream of gases. A conventional gas turbine is fed high-pressure, high-velocity air, extracts energy from it, and leaves as a lower-pressure, slower-moving stream. This action has the side-effect of increasing the <b>upstream</b> <b>pressure,</b> which makes it undesirable for use with a piston engine as it has the side-effect of increasing the back-pressure in the engine, which decreases scavenging of the exhaust gas from the cylinders and thereby lowers the efficiency of the piston portion of a compound engine.|$|E
50|$|The {{limiting}} {{case of the}} Venturi effect is when a fluid reaches the state of choked flow, where the fluid velocity approaches the local speed of sound. When a fluid system {{is in a state}} of choked flow, a further decrease in the downstream pressure environment will not lead to an increase in the mass flow rate. However, mass flow rate for a compressible fluid can increase with increased <b>upstream</b> <b>pressure,</b> which will increase the density of the fluid through the constriction (though the velocity will remain constant). This is the principle of operation of a de Laval nozzle. Increasing source temperature will also increase the local sonic velocity, thus allowing for increased mass flow rate but only if the nozzle area is also increased to compensate for the resulting decrease in density.|$|E
