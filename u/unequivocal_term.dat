We propose a more objective and biologically meaningful way to de. ne the length range of recruits for species that have clear bathymetric segregation during the early stages of their life cycle. The bathymetric distribution of juvenile European hake was studied by fitting a thin plate spline to data from the national autumn trawl survey. Hake showed a stable pattern of depth preference in the 6 -year dataset examined. Small hake had the greatest preference for depths of 170 - 220 m and appeared to move slightly deeper when they reached 10 -cm total length. Larger hake persisted on the continental shelf with a preference for water 70 - 100 m deep, especially when they reached 18 - 20 cm long. The length at migration was defined as the length at which the minimum depth preference was shown, and it ranged between 13. 2 and 15. 8 cm depending on the year. There was a relationship between length at and depth of migration, and we provide a full description of the depth preference of juvenile hake, and test the effectiveness of the analytical approach used...|$|E

According to the viewpoints of both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China, this agreement was given legal force by the Instrument of Surrender of Japan in 1945.

The PRC rejects arguments involving the lack of a specific treaty (San Francisco Peace Treaty) transferring Taiwan's sovereignty to China by noting that neither the PRC nor the ROC was a signatory to any such treaty, making the treaties irrelevant with regard to Chinese claims. The ROC argues that the Treaty of Taipei implicitly transferred sovereignty of Taiwan to it, however the US State Department disagreed with such an interpretation in its 1971 Starr Memorandum.

This advice stated Goldsmith's {{preferred}} view in more <b>unequivocal</b> <b>terms</b> than his earlier memo, without reference to the doubts expressed therein.

Shortly after the leak Goldsmith released a statement in response to such allegations, saying that the two documents were consistent, pointing to the difference in the nature of the two documents and to the firm assurances he claims to have had received between 7 and 17 March that Iraq was indeed in breach of its obligations under Security Council resolutions. The controversy was heightened by the resignation of Elizabeth Wilmshurst, deputy legal adviser at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, on 20 March 2003. A full version of her letter of resignation became public in March 2005. In this, Wilmshurst stated that the reason for her resignation was that she did not agree with the official opinion that {{the use of force in}} Iraq was legal.

I will then outline the limitations and future directions in using Dictyostelium to study disease, and finally conclude that given the evolutionary conservation of genes between Dictyostelium and humans and the organisms' genetic tractability, that this system provides a fertile environment for discovering normal gene function related to neurodegeneration and will permit translational studies in higher systems. </p...|$|R
40|$|Article 39 of the Treaty on European Union sets {{among other}} things the norm of free {{movement}} of workers in Member States. This norm is directly connected with the rule of equal treatment {{of people in the}} context of the European Union and the prohibition of discrimination. However, the same article sets in <b>unequivocal</b> <b>terms</b> in paragraph 4 an exclusion principle concerning the employment in civil service: namely, the access of non-nationals to the national civil service agencies is excluded from the general rule of free movement of workers. Consequently, it has been established mainly through a number of cases which the European Court of Justice had dealt with and through the texts that the European Commission had published, that the exception of article 39 paragraph 4, namely the exclusion principle, ought to be interpreted in a narrow sense. As a result, all public posts should be open to nationals of other Member States of the EU. Restrictions on access should only apply to positions involving the exercise of public authority and the responsibility for safeguarding the general interests of the State or other public bodies. As far as Greece is concerned, recent legislation (an Act of Parliament and a number of Presidential Decrees) provides for EU citizens the opportunity of general access to the public sector agencies and institutions. Taking account of the above, the question of the status of non-nationals in the national civil service in various Member States can be raised. The fact that those positions, to which EU citizens are admitted, cannot in any case be directly or indirectly related to the exercise of power and safeguard of the State’s general interests makes it doubtful whether these positions which are open for admission to nationals or non-nationals do fall within the contours of the constitutional guarantee of tenure. Accordingly, public service jobs, which are not reserved for nationals, need not as a general rule be covered by the constitutional guarantee of permanence. Respectively, a less strict or severe status of employment might be more suitable for them. The above hypothesis has been explored and analyzed in a systematic manner in the course of the thesis, taking into account the available evidence (bibliography, legislation, jurisprudence) in various administrative systems and cultures in the Member States, as well as the relevant academic discourse. ...|$|R
