40|$|Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune–mediated {{disease of}} skin and mucous membran leading to {{progressive}} blistering and chronic erosions. It often begins with blister formations which easily rupture. The characteristic feature is positive nikolsky sign which may or not be presented simultaneously. Establishment of early definite diagnosis is critical and requires correlation of clinical and histopathological findings. Because of this conditon is a potentially life-threatening, <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> complications and mortality rate increases if initial management is non comprehensive and inadequate. Treatment is directed at supression of autoimmune process, typically administration of corticosteroids. This article report a case in a 51 years old woman who had painful chronic oral ulcer and poor general health condition. Prior to the visit to Oral Medicine clinic, patient was treated by her general practitioners for several months, without either established diagnosis nor comprehensive and adequate management, so {{that she had no}} clinical improvement. Clinical examination at the first visit in Oral Medicine clinic Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, revealed bula in the skin, conjunctivitis, easily bleed oral mucosae, widespread erosions and <b>ulcerations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lips,</b> gingiva, tongue, and buccal mucosae. Biopsy of one of skin erosions demonstarting suprabasal intraepithelial acantholysis. Multi divisions in Hospital, such as Oral Medicine, Dermatology, Internal Medicine, Ophtalmology, ENT, were involved in treating this case. Patient received high dose methylprednisolone sistemically and prednisone topically for <b>the</b> <b>lips.</b> General remission achieved in several days. Thus, establishment of early definite diagnosis and adequate management are important in management of Pemphigus vulgaris. DOI:  10. 14693 /jdi. v 16 i 1. 20 </p...|$|R
40|$|A case of {{pemphigus}} vulgaris (PV), putatively {{induced by}} topical application of polymyxin B ear drops, is described. A 3 -year-old, female Tosa Inu, presented with acute onset swelling, blistering and <b>ulceration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pinnae, nostrils, <b>lips</b> and oral mucous membranes. The dog was depressed, febrile and anorexic. For 7 {{days prior to}} <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acute ulcerative disease, polymyxin B ear drops had been applied to both ears to treat an ear infection. Skin and mucosal biopsies showed suprabasilar cleft formation and acantholysis, indicative <b>of</b> PV. <b>The</b> polymyxin B ear drops were discontinued and the dog was treated with intravenous fluids, systemic and topical antibacterial therapy, and immunosuppressive therapy comprising prednisone and azathioprine. Complete remission was noted after 2 weeks, and the immunosuppressive therapy was discontinued one month later. No clinical signs of PV recurred over a 1 year follow-up period. As PV does not usually resolve spontaneously, or enter long-term remission, it was considered that the condition was most likely drug induced due to <b>the</b> aural application <b>of</b> polymyxin B.

40|$|O trabalho foi desenvolvido em duas fases. A primeira constou de aplicação de resina acrílica autopolimerizável sobre dentes de cães experimentais, sem condicionamento ácido do esmalte dental; a gengiva foi analisada histologicamente nos períodos de um, três, sete, 14, 21 e 30 dias. A segunda fase foi conduzida em 20 cães e 10 gatos com fraturas do sistema estomatognático, atendidos no Ambulatório Central da FMVZ/USP. Nessa segunda fase, clínica, foi aplicado condicionamento ácido do esmalte. A resina era usada nas fraturas rostrais às raízes distais do primeiro molar {{inferior}} e do quarto pré-molar superior, bem como na separação da sínfise mentoniana. Os resultados da primeira fase mostraram que mesmo sem o condicionamento ácido houve aderência da resina acrílica sobre os dentes, embora houvesse necessidade de maior volume do material, o que provocou ulcerações dos tecidos moles da boca. Essa fase também evidenciou, à sondagem, que o epitélio de aderência sulcular permaneceu aderido, além de gengivite, ulceração da gengiva, língua e mucosa alveolar. A análise histológica revelou predominantemente ulceração dos tecidos em contato com a resina. Na segunda fase, todos os animais evidenciaram consolidação óssea das fraturas, além de gengivite e ulceração. Lesões periodontais foram encontradas em dois animais dos quais a resina foi removida tardiamente, com quatro e 12 meses após a aplicação, respectivamente. Em ambas as fases, os animais adaptaram-se bem à resina sobre os dentes. This {{paper was}} performed in two phases. In the first one, <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acrylic resin over <b>the</b> teeth <b>of</b> dogs, without enamel acid conditioning, the clinical and histological reaction on the gingiva were analyzed in periods of 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 30 days. The second phase was conducted in 20 dogs and 10 cats, with acid etching technique. The resin {{was used in the}} rostral fractures to <b>the</b> distal roots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower first molar and upper fourth premolar, as well as in <b>the</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> symphisis. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first phase indicated that even without the acid etching technique, the acrylic resin remained fixed over the teeth, although a higher volume of resin was needed, thus inducing more areas <b>of</b> <b>ulceration</b> on <b>the</b> <b>lips,</b> gingiva and tongue. This phase also demonstrated that the sulcular gingival adhesion epithelium remained attached to the teeth. Gingivitis, ulceration on the gingiva, tongue and alveolar mucosa were also observed. The histologic analyses mainly showed <b>ulceration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gingival epithelium. In the second phase all animals featured clinical bone healing in <b>the</b> site <b>of</b> fracture, as well as gingivitis and ulceration. Periodontitis was found in two animals whose resin was not removed up to four and twelve months after application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acrylic resin.

40|$|Most {{theoretical}} descriptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brass instrument lip-reed {{consider the}} acoustical condition at <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> to be a closed, rigid termination, corresponding to a unitary reflectance. This assumption is carried through to many computational models as well. In reality, <b>the</b> protrusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> player's <b>lips</b> into <b>the</b> mouthpiece causes a periodic shortening/extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acoustical tube downstream, an effect sometimes {{but not always}} incorporated into such models. Of interest here is <b>the</b> absorption properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> termination, <b>the</b> so-called 'soft source impedance'. This provides a further modification to the boundary condition at <b>the</b> <b>lips,</b> since <b>the</b> soft, deformable nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> are likely to cause some extra damping <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acoustic standing wave. Measurements are presented to demonstrate this damping effect using an artificial mouth.

40|$|BackgroundThe {{incidence}} of vascular anomalies {{in the head}} and neck is higher than in the extremities. It is especially common for vascular anomalies to involve <b>the</b> <b>lip.</b> <b>The</b> <b>lips</b> are a functionally and aesthetically important component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head and neck area. A retrospective analysis of data from our vascular anomaly center was performed in order to understand the characteristics and treatment requirements of vascular anomalies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> and to establish which treatments are likely to lead to the best outcomes. MethodsA retrospective review was performed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medical records <b>of</b> patients diagnosed with vascular anomalies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper or lower lip from January 2001 to September 2013. Using clinical photographs, radiologic findings, and patient records, <b>the</b> diagnosis <b>of</b> each case and <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vascular anomaly were recorded, along with information about treatment and follow-up. ResultsA total of 1, 606 patients were diagnosed with vascular anomalies over this time period, of whom 127 (7. 9 %) were found to have vascular anomalies in <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> only. Surgical treatment with or without embolization, sclerotherapy, laser therapy, medication only, and observation were the treatment strategies adopted in these cases.
