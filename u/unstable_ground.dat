500|$|Firefighters created [...] of {{fireline}} by {{hand and}} [...] with mechanized equipment such as bulldozers. Most of the bulldozer work was done on the North Fork fire. Some other fires were too remote or in too steep terrain for the safe operation of heavy equipment, and bulldozers were prohibited from many areas because of the impact they have on surface features. Additionally, the thin, <b>unstable</b> <b>ground</b> near the park's geothermal features could not be trusted to support the weight of heavy equipment. Bulldozers are rarely used on fires in U.S. National Parks.|$|E
500|$|The most {{challenging}} {{part of the}} construction was the [...] railway tunnel from Etterstad, just east of Oslo S, to Lillestrøm.

500|$|Two {{people were}} killed in an {{accident}} on 27 November 2013, which destroyed part of the east building. A crane fell while carrying a part of the roof, destroying eight columns of the LED screen and part of an internal slab.

Odebrecht refuted the conclusions, and showed a study by private company Geocompany as proof. Another report on the incident provided by IPT/University of São Paulo blamed the accident on the counterweights being heavier than what was specified on the rigging plan. Crane operations in the stadium were suspended at the time; all cranes on the site were inspected and approved to continue work 16 days later. The families of the deceased workers received R$2.9million in compensation.|$|E

40|$|Outlet glaciers {{grounded}} on a {{bed that}} deepens inland and extends below sea level are potentially vulnerable to ‘marine ice sheet instability’. This instability, which may lead to runaway ice loss, has been simulated in models, but its consequences have not been directly observed in geological records. Here we provide new surface-exposure ages from an outlet of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet that reveal rapid glacier thinning occurred approximately 7, 000 years ago, {{in the absence of}} large environmental changes. Glacier thinning persisted for more than two and a half centuries, resulting in hundreds of metres of ice loss. Numerical simulations indicate that ice surface drawdown accelerated when the otherwise steadily retreating glacier encountered a bedrock trough. Together, the geological reconstruction and numerical simulations suggest that centennial-scale glacier thinning arose from <b>unstable</b> <b>grounding</b> line retreat. Capturing these instability processes in ice sheet models is important for predicting Antarctica’s future contribution to sea level change...|$|R
40|$|Two European Space Agency (ESA) -funded {{projects}} {{have recently been}} completed which investigated the Earth Observation market development potentials for Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) in relation to operational mining and pipeline applications. This paper {{provides an overview of}} selected InSAR test studies and findings from both ESA-supported projects. Operational limitations for mining and pipeline companies – as they relate to the use of InSAR technologies in developing countries, in particular – are also discussed. InSAR can play an important future role in the management, analysis, monitoring and remediation of <b>unstable</b> <b>grounds</b> associated with mining and pipeline operations. InSAR results, when used in conjunction with current geotechnical techniques and practices, can provide engineers with reliable information that can assist with risk management and operational decision-making.

2500|$|The Schramm T-130 was {{directed}} to bore toward the workshop, a space that was accessible by the miners. The T-130 became operational on 5 September and worked in three stages. First, it needed to enlarge the 5.5inches (14cm) hole to a 12inches (30cm) hole. It then needed to drill the 12inches (30cm) hole into a 28inches (71cm) diameter hole. [...] "If we tried to drill from a 5.5 inches (14 cm) hole to a 28 inches (71 cm) hole, the torque would be too high and it would ... put the drill bits under too much pressure," [...] said Schramm, Inc. Latin American Regional Manager, Claudio Soto. However by reusing the same hole, there was still added pressure on the drill. Delays occurred because of issues with {{the neck of the}} drills caused by the angle of the drilling. Rescuers couldn't drill vertically since that would require placing the heavy rig on the <b>unstable</b> <b>ground</b> where the cave in had happened. And the rescuers also had to avoid drilling into the production tunnels that wind above the shelter. Soto added, during the rescue, [...] "It's a difficult hole. It's curved and deep.

2500|$|The Birmingham Canal Navigations {{carried out}} a number of {{improvements}} in the 1850s. The Netherton Tunnel, running parallel to the Dudley Tunnel but further to the east, was begun on 31 December 1855, and completed on 20 August 1858. It was the last canal tunnel to be built in England, and compared to the Dudley Tunnel it was huge, being around [...] from side to side at water level, with a towpath on both sides. It was found necessary to build an invert through the tunnel, because of <b>unstable</b> <b>ground</b> caused by mining below its line, and large retaining walls were required at each end. As a result, the cost rose from £238,000 to £302,000, and a tunnel toll was charged to help recoup the cost. Gas lights provided illumination, which were later replaced by electric lighting. The short Two Locks Line was built to reduce the distance travelled by boats passing through the Lapal Tunnel and heading for the Stourbridge Canal. Brewins Tunnel, which had been built on the Lodge Farm Cut in 1838 was made into a cutting, and the Delph Flight of nine locks were rebuilt, the middle seven being replaced by six new locks. A loop to the south of the Netherton Tunnel at Bumble Hole was eliminated by making a new cut.|$|E

40|$|Different {{approaches}} to circumscribe staminodial {{structures in the}} angiosperms are reviewed. The need for a morphological distinction between "true staminodes" (derived from stamens or homologous to stamens) and "pseudostaminodes" (nonhomologous to stamens) is emphasized. In phylogenetic studies the term "staminode" is often used uncritically, without knowledge of the true homology of these structures. Staminodes are either whole organs (outer tiers or whorls, namely petals, intermediate tiers, or organs within a tier), or partial organs. This article aims to discuss the shortcomings {{of the past and}} current approach of staminodes and proposes definitions of staminode types for use as characters in phylogenetic analyses. Staminodial structures should be classified according to their position and function in the flower. Both aspects are intricately linked and make the identification of staminodes sometimes problematic. Shifts in time (heterochrony) and space (heterotopy or homeosis) make that a regressing organ either aborts completely or becomes remodeled into something new. Petals are included in the definition of staminodes as they combine function and heterotopy. A hierarchical ordering of staminodial types is given and discussed. Three interdependent but possibly complementary functions are attached to the occurrence of staminodes: an attractive, nutritional, and structural function. The importance of staminodes for the evolution of the androecium and flower is demonstrated. The difficulty in unmasking pseudostaminodes, comprising receptacular disks, is demonstrated. The value and shortcomings of molecular-based interpretations of staminodes are discussed. It is shown that the decision to recognize a staminode from receptacular emergences often relies on <b>unstable</b> <b>grounds</b> and remains largely dependent on the acceptance of a given phylogenetic background. status: publishe...|$|R
