40|$|The <b>unanimous</b> <b>shareholder</b> <b>agreement</b> is {{a feature}} of most Canadian {{corporate}} statutes that allows the shareholders to, by creating an agreement meeting the necessary criteria, restrict {{the powers of the}} directors to manage the business and affairs of the corporation. One possible justification for this is the "nexus of contracts" theory that all corporations are notionally reducible to voluntary agreements. Three key areas of ambiguity surrounding unanimous shareholder agreements are examined in this dissertation, with specific reference to existing judgments. The requirements for their formation are reviewed, including the exact meaning and strictness of the unanimity criterion and the necessity and validity of possible restrictions upon the directors. Four competing approaches to their enforcement are identified and contrasted: the corporate constitutional approach that truly removes the board's powers, the contractual approach that treats unanimous shareholder agreements as contracts existing alongside the corporate power structure, and the directors' duties and oppression approaches that apply existing corporate law remedies to deal with violations. The transfer of duties and liabilities that accompanies unanimous shareholder agreements is considered in the context of unusual power structures and stakeholder theory, revealing unaddressed and possibly unsolvable problems in the legislation. It is concluded that, although the <b>unanimous</b> <b>shareholder</b> <b>agreement</b> may suggest a move toward a more contractual view of the corporation, it can also be understood as a specific tool within the statutory framework...|$|E
50|$|On 1 May 2015, Yukon {{modified}} its Business Corporations Act, in {{an effort}} to attract more benefits and participants to its economy. One amendment to the BCA lets a proxy be given for voting purposes. Another change will allow directors to pursue business opportunities declined by the corporation, a practice off-limits in most other jurisdictions due to the inherent potential for conflicts of interest. One of the changes will allow a corporation to serve as a director of a subsidiary registered in Yukon. The legislation also allows companies to add provisions in their articles of incorporation giving directors blanket approval to sell of all of the company’s assets without requiring a shareholder vote. If provided for by a <b>unanimous</b> <b>shareholders</b> <b>agreement,</b> a corporation is not required to have directors at all. There is increased flexibility regarding the location of corporate records offices, including the ability to maintain a records office outside of the Yukon so long as it is accessible by electronic means.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The <b>shareholders</b> <b>{{agreement}}</b> is {{an agreement}} {{drawn up by}} the shareholders when the company is founded, or after its foundation, to rule one or more aspects of the relationships held by the <b>shareholders.</b> The <b>shareholders</b> <b>agreement</b> phenomenon is particularly relevant in the Italian context, where {{it is possible to}} observe a lot of companies with fragmentized ownership in which it is not often possible to find an economic subject that holds so many shares to manage the company. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate the typologies and the diffusion of the <b>shareholders</b> <b>agreements</b> of the Italian listed companies, with the aim to analyze their influence on the corporate governance policies. The paper wants to answer to the following question: do some enterprise characteristics exist that makes more probable that a company adopt a <b>shareholder</b> <b>agreement</b> respects to another one? The empirical analysis is developed on the Italian listed companies at the date of 30, April 2010, belonging to all the sectors classified by Milan Stock Exchange...|$|R
40|$|<b>Shareholder</b> <b>agreements</b> {{reflect a}} reassertion of contractualism in {{corporate}} law {{at a time}} when statutory regulation is more extensive than ever. Though not displacing the s 140 statutory contract between members, <b>shareholder</b> <b>agreements</b> {{have a role to play}} both in direct contract between parties but also in setting reasonable expectations that may play a role in oppression actions or winding up on the just and equitable basis. As contracts they are prima facie enforceable but also subject to statutory overlays in the form of the laws of misleading and deceptive conduct and unconscionable conduct. Finally they are subject to some limitation in that the common law suggests that a company cannot in a <b>shareholder</b> <b>agreement</b> deprive itself of its power to alter its own constitution. There is also some doubt about the extent to which directors’ duties can be attenuated by <b>shareholder</b> <b>agreement</b> and whether <b>shareholder</b> disputes can be made the subject exclusively of commercial arbitration and kept out of the courts...|$|R

40|$|In listed companies, some {{shareholders}} can be signatories to {{agreements that}} govern their relations. Such agreements are {{often viewed as}} means of insulating the firm from the market for corporate control. Specific provisions (namely concerted action, pre-emptive buying rights and repartitioning of board seats) are indeed likely to influence the outcome of takeovers. Using a sample of French deals, this paper investigates the impact of <b>shareholder</b> <b>agreements</b> on takeover premiums. A <b>shareholder</b> <b>agreement</b> is in force in 27. 1 % of target companies. A positive relationship between shareholder pacts and takeover premiums is observed. This result is robust {{to the use of}} an econometrical specification which treats as endogenous the existence of a <b>shareholder</b> <b>agreement.</b> This finding suggests that shareholder pacts dramatically increase the negotiating power of target shareholders.

The results indicate a negative effect of the shareholders’ agreement on firm value. This effect is higher in the presence of generic clauses and lower in the presence of specific clauses, even after controlling for the endogeneity of the shareholders’ decision to adopt <b>shareholder</b> <b>agreements.</b> The results allow us to conclude that controlling shareholders use the <b>shareholder</b> <b>agreements</b> as a mechanism to enhance control at the expense of firm value (entrenchment effect).
