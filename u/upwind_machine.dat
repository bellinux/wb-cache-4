40|$|The SWT- 3 wind turbine, a {{microprocessor}} controlled three bladed variable speed <b>upwind</b> <b>machine</b> with a 3 MW rating that is presently operational and undergoing system testing, is discussed. The tower, a rigid triangular truss configuration, is rotated about its vertical axis {{to position the}} wind turbine into the prevailing wind. The blades rotate at variable speed {{in order to maintain}} an optimum 6 to 1 tip speed ratio between cut in and fated wind velocity, thereby maximizing power extraction from the wind. Rotor variable speed is implemented by the use of a hydrostatic transmission consisting of fourteen fixed displacement pumps operating in conjunction with eighteen variable displacement motors. Full blade pitch with on-off hydraulic actuation is used to maintain 3 MW of output power...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} and discusses {{the results of}} detailed strain gauge measurements taken {{from the surface of}} a composite blade on a small horizontal-axis wind turbine. We believe that these are the first such measurements to be taken on a small wind turbine. The two-bladed <b>upwind</b> <b>machine</b> is located adjacent to Fort Scratchley, a historic seaside landmark in Newcastle, and has a nominal rated output of 5 kW at a wind and rotor speed of 10 m/s and 400 RPM respectively. A series of field experiments were undertaken where the aeroelastic response of the blade was measured with 26 surface mounted strain gauges, along with the wind speed and direction, turbine speed and direction and turbine power output. The results show a periodic fluctuation in both the blade flapping and lead-lag directions with a once per revolution period...|$|E
40|$|Six {{types of}} aerosol {{samplers}} were evaluated experimentally {{in a test}} chamber with polydisperse fly ash. The Andersen sampler overestimates the mass of small particles due to particle bounce between stages and therefore provides a conservative estimate of respirable particulate mass and thoracic particulate mass. The TSP sampler provides an unbiased estimate of total particulate mass. TSP/CCM provides no information below ESD 2 ????m and therefore underestimates respirable particulate mass. The PM 10 sampler provides a reasonable estimate of the thoracic particulate fraction. The RespiCon sampler provides an unbiased estimate of respirable, thoracic, and inhalable fractions. DustTrak and SidePak monitors provide relative particle concentrations instead of absolute concentrations because {{it could not be}} calibrated for absolute particle concentrations with varying particle shape, composition, and density. Six sampler technologies were used to evaluate airborne dust concentrations released from oilfield pipe rattling operations. The task sampled was the removal of scale deposited on the inner wall of the pipe before it was removed from service in a producing well. The measured mass concentrations of the aerosol samplers show that a Gaussian plume model is applicable to the data of pipe rattling operations for finding an attainment area. It is estimated that workers who remain within 1 m of the machine centerline and directly downwind have an 8 -hour TWA exposure opportunity of (13. 3 ???? 9. 7) mg/m 3 for the Mud Lake pipe scale and (11. 4 ???? 9. 7) mg/m 3 for the Lake Sand pipe scale at 95 % confidence. At distances more than 4 m downwind from the machine centerline, dust concentrations are below the TWA-TLV of 10 mg/m 3 for the worker in both scales. At positions crosswind or <b>upwind</b> from the <b>machine</b> centerline there is no measurable exposure. Available data suggest that the attainment area for the public starts at about 9 m downwind from the machine centerline in both scales, as 24 hour average concentrations at these distances are smaller than the 0. 15 mg/m 3, the NAAQS for unrestricted public access. The PSD of the suspended plume is dominated by particles smaller than ESD 50 ????m...|$|R
