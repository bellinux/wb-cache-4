5|$|The AH-64E Apache has {{the ability}} to control {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (<b>UAVs),</b> used by the U.S. Army to perform aerial scouting missions previously performed by the OH-58 Kiowa. Apaches can request to take control of an RQ-7 Shadow or MQ-1C Grey Eagle from ground control stations to safely scout via datalink communications. There are four levels of UAV interoperability (LOI): LOI 1 indirectly receives payload data; LOI 2 receives payload data through direct communication; LOI 3 deploys the UAV's armaments; and LOI 4 takes over flight control. <b>UAVs</b> can search for enemies and, if equipped with a laser designator, target them for the Apache or other friendly aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Some {{loitering}} munitions {{may return}} and be recovered {{by the operator}} if they are unused in an attack and have enough fuel; in particular this is characteristic of <b>UAVs</b> with a secondary suicide mission. Other systems, such as Delilah or IAI Harop, don't have a recovery option and are self-destructed in mission aborts.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s these battleships {{made use}} of the RQ-2 Pioneer, an {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle employed in spotting for the guns. Launched from the fantail using a rocket-assist booster that was discarded shortly after takeoff, the Pioneer carried a video camera in a pod under {{the belly of the}} aircraft which transmitted live video to the ship so operators could observe enemy actions or fall of shot during naval gunnery. To land the UAV a large net was deployed {{at the back of the}} ship; the aircraft was flown into it. Missouri and Wisconsin both used the Pioneer <b>UAVs</b> successfully during Operation Desert Storm, and in one particularly memorable incident, a Pioneer UAV operated by Wisconsin received the surrender of Iraqi troops during combat operations. This particular Pioneer was later donated to the Smithsonian Institution, and is now on public display. During Operation Desert Storm these Pioneers were operated by detachments of VC-6. In addition to the Pioneer <b>UAVs,</b> the recommissioned Iowas could support six types of helicopters: the Sikorsky HO3S-1, UH-1 Iroquois, SH-2 Seasprites, CH-46 Sea Knight, CH-53 Sea Stallion and the LAMPS III SH-60B Seahawk.|$|E

5|$|Formerly {{known as}} AH-64D Block III, in 2012, it was redesignated as AH-64E Guardian to {{represent}} its increased capabilities. The AH-64E features improved digital connectivity, the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System, more powerful T700-GE-701D engines with upgraded face gear transmission to accommodate more power, capability to control {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (<b>UAVs),</b> full IFR capability, and improved landing gear. New composite rotor blades, which successfully completed testing in 2004, increase cruise speed, climb rate, and payload capacity. Deliveries began in November 2011. Full-rate production was approved on 24 October 2012, with 634 AH-64Ds to be upgraded to AH-64E standard and production of 56 new-build AH-64Es to start in 2019/20. Changes in production lots 4 through 6 shall include a cognitive decision aiding system and new self-diagnostic abilities. The updated Longbow radar has an oversea capacity, potentially enabling naval strikes; an AESA radar is under consideration. The E model is to be fit for maritime operations. The Army has {{expressed a desire to}} add extended-range fuel tanks to the AH-64E to further increase range and endurance. AH-64Es are to have the L-3 Communications MUM-TX datalink installed in place of two previous counterparts, communicating on C, D, L, and Ku frequency bands to transmit and receive data and video with all Army <b>UAVs.</b> Lots 5 and 6 will be equipped with Link 16 data-links.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{loitering}} munitions {{were not}} {{referred to as}} such but rather as suicide <b>UAVs</b> or loitering missiles. Different sources point at different projects as originating the weapon category. The early 1980s initial Israeli Delilah variants or the failed US AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow program are mentioned by some sources. Alternatively, the late 1980s IAI Harpy which was widely exported is considered by some as the first loitering munition system.|$|E
5|$|Predator {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (<b>UAVs)</b> {{flew over}} Lal Masjid and Jamia Hafsa on 8 and 9 July, capturing {{images of the}} deployment of people inside. Security forces had the images taken to study the claims of Ghazi Abdul Rashid regarding casualties and damage caused to Lal Masjid and Jamia Hafsa.

Senior government officials and the Security Forces personnel examined the pictures and relayed the information directly to the command post on the ground. The UAV was given to Pakistan by the United States for use in the War on Terror. Strategic planning for the assault on the mosque was conducted based on information gathered by the drone. Pakistan deployed several security units to execute the attack on the mosque. These include the Army's 78th Paratrooper Brigade and 111th Infantry Brigade; its elite strike force, the Special Service Group (SSG) Division; the Ninth Wing Company of the Pakistan Army, the Rangers paramilitary force; and the Elite Police squad of the Punjab Police.|$|E
5000|$|Based on the {{experienced}} gained {{in developing the}} quadcopter and fixed-wing <b>UAV,</b> FJUT fielded its third <b>UAV,</b> dubbed as surveillance <b>UAV,</b> because it was originally developed to perform aerial surveillance missions.

5|$|The {{response}} to {{the first generation of}} fixed installation surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) such as SA-2 and SA-3 was the development of the anti-radiation missile such as AGM-45 Shrike and other means to attack fixed SAM installations, as well as developing SEAD doctrines. The Soviet counter-response was the use of mobile SAMs such as SA-6 with intermittent use of radar. Thus, the SAM battery was only visible for a small period of time, during which it was also a significant threat to high-value Wild Weasel fighters. In 1982 Operation Mole Cricket 19 various means including <b>UAVs</b> and air-launched Samson decoys were used over suspected SAM areas to saturate enemy SAMs and to bait them to activate their radar systems, which were then attacked by anti-radiation missiles.|$|E

5|$|On 23 February 2004, the U.S. Army {{announced}} that {{they had decided to}} terminate all work on the Comanche program. At the time, it was stated that the Army had determined that a number of upgrades would be necessary in order for the RAH-66 to be capable of surviving on the battlefield in the face of current anti-aircraft threats; however, the Army had instead decided to re-direct the bulk of its funding for rotary development toward the renovation of its existing helicopter fleet of attack, utility, and reconnaissance aircraft. Specifically, the Army also had plans to reuse the funds allocated to the Comanche program to speed up development of unmanned aerial vehicles (<b>UAVs),</b> which could also perform the scouting role intended for the vehicle. At the time of its termination, the Comanche program had reportedly spent US$6.9billion. The contract termination fees involved were estimated to total US$450–680million for the main program partners Sikorsky and Boeing.|$|E
5|$|Though {{several new}} fixed wing {{aircraft}} and helicopters were inducted into the navy in the early 2000s, they {{were assigned to the}} existing squadrons with no new squadrons being commissioned until 2006. In January of that year, INAS 342, the first squadron to be equipped with <b>UAVs,</b> was commissioned. Later that year, the Sea Harrier training assigned to INAS 551 were detached and commissioned separately as INAS 552. However, the Sea Harriers were phased out in May 2016, and presently the operational status of the squadron is unknown. On 24 March 2009, for the first time, two squadrons—INAS 311 and INAS 350—were commissioned on the same day. INAS 311 is intended for maritime patrol and operates Do-228s, whereas INAS 350, a multirole helicopter squadron, operates Sikorsky SH-3s. In 2011–2012, another two UAV squadrons—INAS 343 and INAS 344—were commissioned.
