50|$|Any {{owner of}} a genuine {{heirloom}} could dispose of it during his lifetime, {{but he could not}} <b>bequeath</b> it <b>by</b> <b>will</b> away from the estate. If he died intestate it went to his heir-at-law, and if he devised the estate it went to the devisee. The word subsequently acquired a secondary meaning, applied to furniture, pictures, etc., vested in trustees to hold on trust for the person for the time being entitled to the possession of a settled house. Such things were more properly called settled chattels. As of 1 January 1997, no further settled land can be created and the remaining pre-existing settlements have a declining importance in English law.|$|R

The library commenced operation in 1925 and in 1926 it was merged with the older Public Library, which operated in Argostoli since 1887. The 1953 Ionian earthquake totally destroyed the library building, however the books were salvaged.

50|$|The Bithynians were a Thracian {{people living}} in {{northwest}} Anatolia. After Alexander's conquests the region of Bithynia came {{under the rule of}} the native king Bas, who defeated Calas, a general of Alexander the Great, and maintained the independence of Bithynia. His son, Zipoetes I of Bithynia maintained this autonomy against Lysimachus and Seleucus I, and assumed the title of king (basileus) in 297 BC. His son and successor, Nicomedes I, founded Nicomedia, which soon rose to great prosperity, and during his long reign (c. 278 - c. 255 BC), {{as well as those of}} his successors, the kingdom of Bithynia held a considerable place among the minor monarchies of Anatolia. Nicomedes also invited the Celtic Galatians into Anatolia as mercenaries, and they later turned on his son Prusias I, who defeated them in battle. Their last king, Nicomedes IV, was unable to maintain himself against Mithridates VI of Pontus, and, after being restored to his throne by the Roman Senate, he <b>bequeathed</b> his kingdom <b>by</b> <b>will</b> to the Roman republic (74 BC).|$|R
