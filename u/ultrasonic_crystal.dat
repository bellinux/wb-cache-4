Waveguides for acoustic waves are further created by removing a line defect, on which stubs can be added by removing rods from the side-walls of the waveguide. Full transmission is observed for a one-period-wide straight waveguide within the full-band-gap of the perfect phononic crystal, i. e. for a waveguide aperture smaller than one acoustic wavelength. Waveguiding over a wide frequency range is also obtained for a one-period-wide waveguide with two sharp 90 bends.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an acoustic method for inducing rotating vortex flows in microchannels. An <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>crystal</b> {{is used to}} create an acoustic standing wave field in the channel and thus induce a Rayleigh flow transverse to the laminar flow in the channel. Mixing in microchannels is strictly diffusion-limited because of the laminar flow, a transverse flow will greatly enhance mixing of the reactants. This is especially evident in chemical microsystems in which the chemical reaction is performed on a solid phase and only one reactant is actually diffusing. The method has been evaluated on two different systems, a mixing channel with two parallel flows and a porous silicon micro enzyme reactor for protein digestion. In both systems a significant increase of the mixing ratio is detected in a narrow band of frequency for the actuating ultrasound...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} the effects of late reperfusion on myocardial infarct shape and to quantitate associated changes in left ventricular volume. Reperfusion was delayed until there was no salvage of ischemic myocardium. Dogs underwent 6. 5 h of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion (n = 5) or 5. 5 h of occlusion and 1 h of reperfusion (n = 5). Infarct shape was measured with pairs of ultrasonic crystals implanted circumferentially in the mid myocardium. Infarct stiffness was determined from end-diastolic pressure-segment length curves produced by aortic clamping. Left ventricular volume was measured with three pairs of endocardial ultrasonic crystals and the effect of infarct shape change on left ventricular volume was determined. Infarct size, expressed as a percent of the area at risk, was similar in reperfused (97 ± 1 %) and nonreperfused (98 ± 1 %) hearts. After coronary artery occlusion, infarct segments became akinetic and functional dilation, measured as end-diastolic <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>crystal</b> separation, increased to a similar extent in reperfosed (24 ± 7 %) and nonreperfused (19 ± 3 %) hearts. In 13 additional dogs that underwent reperfusion and instrumentation with endocardial ultrasonic crystals for volume measurement, left ventricular volume increased 42 ± 6 % over the preocclusion level (p < 0. 001). Within minutes of reperfusion, the infarct stiffened, infarct dilation decreased to 1 ± 4 % over the baseline preocclusion level (p < 0. 05 vs. prereperfusion) and left ventricular volume decreased to 16 ± 11 % over the baseline level (p < 0. 01 vs. postocclusion). Thus, coronary artery reperfusion reverses initial infarct dilation. Changes in infarct dilation occur immediately after reperfusion and are accompanied by infarct stiffening and a decrease in left ventricular volume.

A pair of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>crystals,</b> an electromagnetic flow probe and a cuff occluder {{were placed on}} the left circumflex coronary artery in 12 mongrel dogs under sterile conditions. Reactive hyperemia after 20 s of coronary occlusion dilated the epicardial coronary artery by 120 ± 14 μm (3. 8 ± 0. 6 %, p < 0. 01) from 3. 167 ± 0. 345 mm. This reactive dilation was abolished by flow-limiting coronary stenosis. However, vasodilation after nitroglycerin was 168 ± 26 μm (5. 1 ± 0. 5 %) and 162 ± 27 μm (4. 9 ± 0. 6 %), respectively, before and after flow limitation. After removal of the endothelium by a balloon catheter, dilation of the epicardial coronary artery after reactive hyperemia was markedly attenuated to 7 ± 4 μm (p < 0. 01 versus before denudation), despite the presence of a similar degree of reactive hyperemia. The extent of coronary dilation after nitroglycerin was unchanged before and after de-endothelialization.

In anesthetized open-chest dogs, six episodes of five-minute coronary occlusion followed by a fifteen-minute reperfusion were performed.

However, in the adenosine-treated animals, regional wall motion fifteen minutes after the sixth reperfusion did not differ from baseline.

Although cardiac output and left ventricular stroke work were maintained through chamber enlargement until total myocardial blood flow deficit was about 10 %, ejection indexes of left ventricular function decreased progressively with increasing ischemia and correlated inversely with total myocardial blood flow deficit (r = − 0. 55 to − 0. 73). Ejection indexes of left ventricular global function correlated directly with regional function in the ischemic zone (r = 0. 67 to 0. 83), although global function decreased at a far slower rate than regional contraction during progressive coronary stenosis with an ischemic region comprising about 25 % of total left ventricular weight.

40|$|Background—Quantification of {{regional}} myocardial function {{is a major}} unresolved issue in cardiology. We evaluated the accuracy of pulsed Doppler tissue imaging (DTI), a new echocardiographic technique, to quantify regional myocardial dysfunction induced by acute ischemia and reperfusion. Methods and Results—In nine open-chest anesthetized pigs, various degrees {{of regional}} wall motion abnormalities were induced by graded reduction of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) blood flow. Pulsed Doppler tissue imaging was performed from an epicardial apical four-chamber view with the sample placed within the middle part of the septal wall. Peak septal velocities were calculated during systole, isovolumic relaxation, and early and late diastole. Regional myocardial blood flow and systolic and diastolic dysfunctions were assessed by radioactive microspheres and <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>crystals,</b> respectively. Ischemia resulted in a significant rapid reduction of systolic velocities and an early decrease in the ratio of early to late diastolic velocities. Both changes were detected by pulsed DTI within 5 seconds of coronary artery occlusion. The decrease in systolic velocity significantly correlated with both systolic shortening (r 5. 90, P,. 0001) and regional myocardial blood flow (r 5. 96, P,. 0001) during reduction of LAD blood flow.

Twenty 2 min total occlusions were provoked in the left anterior descending coronary artery, with 3 min recovery intervals (reperfusion) between occlusions. The shortening fraction decreased progressively with each occlusion, reaching a value 18 - 9 % lower than the basal after the last ischaemic episode (P< 005); 32 - 3 % after 4 h of reperfusion (P< 001), and 28 - 6 % after 24 h (¥< 001).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Congenital {{origin of}} the left {{coronary}} artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA-syndrome) can result in chronic left ventricular dysfunction due to hypoxic hypoperfusion of the myocardium supplied by the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). Portions of this dysfunctional tissue might recover after revascularization and thus, might represent hibernating myocardium. In the present experimental study we tried to establish an artificial ALCAPA syndrome in anaesthetized pigs {{as a model for}} chronic hibernating myocardium. METHODS AN RESULTS: A segment of the carotid artery was interposed between the pulmonary artery and the LAD as a bypass graft. Coronary blood flow in the LAD was reduced by sequential inflations of a cuff occluder. Simultaniously, incremental increases of antegrade blood flow through the artificial bypass graft resulted in reduction of regional wallmotion, as assessed by reduced segment shortening measured by <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>crystals.</b> Histologic analysis of the hypoperfused, hypoxic myocardial territory showed severe cellular degeneration, myolysis, and alteration of the chromatin structure comparable to ischemic cell death after one hour of LAD occlusion.

To determine whether lipids accumulate with a brief ischemic insult, myocardial lipid content was evaluated by 1 H NMR spectroscopy of ex-vivo samples from seven dogs in a model of postischemic dysfunction created by 15 min of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion followed by 3 h of reperfusion. Regional myocardial function was assessed by measuring segment length shortening with use {{of a pair of}} <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>crystals</b> placed in the ischemic zone and in the control zone. During the occlusion, all dogs had significant ischemia of the occlusion zone as measured by radiolabeled microspheres (0. 08 ± 0. 08 versus 0. 88 ± 0. 09 ml/g per min for the control zone), and all dogs developed systolic stretching of the ischemic zone segment. Myocardial lipid content was significantly elevated in the samples from the coronary occlusion zone (p < 0. 02). The increase in lipid signal may result from the ischemia-induced decrease in beta oxidation and resultant accumulation of fatty acyl esters (for example, fatty acids, triglycerides and acylcarnitines).

For matched end systolic pressure and heart rate, the increase in inotropic state produced by noradrenaline infusion significantly shifted the pressure-diameter relation to the left. Similarly, end systolic pressure and diameter were significantly lowered by sodium nitroprusside infusion, with a reflex increase of heart rate; and a decrease in inotropic state produced by verapamil infusion was demonstrated by a significantly larger end systolic diameter for matched end systolic pressure and heart rate. The pressure-diameter relation was not modified by volume loading, which increased end diastolic diameter by 9. 6 (1. 1) % with no evidence of a Bainbridge reflex.

The usefulness of this approach, however, in eliciting regional dysfunction {{in the presence of}} mild to moderate single-vessel coronary disease quantitated on the basis of coronary flow reserve measurements has not been previously defined. Open-chest, anesthetized dogs were instrumented with an electromagnetic flow probe, high-fidelity micromanometers, and subendocardial <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>crystals.</b> A rigid, screw occluder was used to produce five subcritical coronary stenoses in each dog associated with varying impairment of postocclusion reactive hyperemia at rest but no impairment of resting coronary blood flow. Regional function at rest and in response to the isoproterenol challenge (0. 25 [mu]g/kg/min) in nonstenotic and stenotic conditions was assessed. Relative regional function was maintained during the infusion until nearly total loss of coronary flow reserve. With this near-critical stenosis, function was lower than in the nonstenotic state but remained greater than resting control values. Moderate impairments of coronary flow reserve were not associated with isoproterenol-induced deterloration of regional function. In conclusion, detection of impaired coronary flow reserve at rest is a more sensitive index of the severity of a coronary stenosis than is detection of regional dysfunction during isoproterenol challenge. Fallure to maintain the expected isoproterenol-induced increase in regional function is manifested only when stenoses are associated with nearly total loss of resting coronary flow reserve. This suggests that the clinical use of isoproterenol challenge is not effective in eliciting regional dysfunction when mild coronary disease is present...|$|R
40|$|The {{usefulness}} of end-systolic measures of ventricular function was {{compared with that}} of standard contractility indexes in conscious dogs. End-systolic relations between left ventricular pressure and volume and between pressure and wall thickness were analyzed in dogs previously instrumented with <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>crystals.</b> Progressive angiotensin infusions were used to generate computer-averaged pressure-volume and pressure-wall thickness loops. Both relations were linear in every study and highly reproducible. With low and high dose dobutamine, the end-systolic pressure-volume relations were significantly displaced, with increased slope and inconsistent changes in intercept. This relation was more useful than the ejection fraction for detecting contractility increases at different afterloads, but it showed no advantage over maximal left ventricular dP/dt at all ranges of preload and after-load. The end-systolic pressure-volume relations were insensitive for detecting mild decreases in inotropic state produced by propranolol, and maximal dP/dt was superior for detecting such mild acutely reduced contractility. The end-systolic pressure-wall thickness relations showed displacement with dobutamine, although slope and intercept changes were not significant; these relations did not detect mild decreases in contractility produced by propranolol. It is concluded that the end-systolic pressure-volume relation and a simplified end-systolic measure using pressure and wall thickness provide sensitive, load-independent and reproducible approaches for defining acute increases in left ventricular contractility in conscious animals. Maximal dP/dt was equally effective for defining these increases in contractility and more sensitive for detecting slight acute decreases in contractility...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} prenalterol, a {{selective}} beta 1 -adrenoceptor agonist with potent cardiac positive inotropic properties {{have been investigated}} on regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) (microspheres) and contractile function (<b>ultrasonic</b> <b>crystals)</b> during partial circumflex coronary artery stenosis in 8 open-chest anaesthetized dogs. Prenalterol was investigated at two intravenous doses: 5 micrograms kg- 1, which increased myocardial contractility (dP/dt max: + 29 %) more than heart rate (+ 12 %, up to 150 beats min- 1) and 20 micrograms kg- 1 which induced almost similar increases in contractility (+ 35 %) and heart rate (+ 31 % up to 175 beats min- 1). The induced modifications of regional flow and function were then compared to those produced in another series of 6 dogs by atrial pacing at 150 and 175 beats min- 1 respectively. Prenalterol significantly increased RMBF and segment length (SL) -shortening in a dose-dependent manner in the nonischaemic zone. In the ischaemic zone, RMBF was maintained and SL-shortening increased with prenalterol, 5 micrograms kg- 1 whereas both RMBF and contractile function were severely decreased with prenalterol, 20 micrograms kg- 1. Atrial pacing had almost no effect on RMBF and SL-shortening in the nonischaemic zone. In the ischaemic zone, atrial pacing rate-dependently decreased both RMBF and SL-shortening. Thus, {{a significant increase in}} contractility, associated with little tachycardia (prenalterol, 5 micrograms kg- 1), induces beneficial effects on RMBF and function in both the nonischaemic and ischaemic myocardium.

40|$|SUMMARY This study {{examined}} the relationships between left ventricular (LV) regional function, regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF), and myocellular necrosis after sudden proximal occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) in 36 awake, unsedated dogs. Net wall thickening during systole (NET) {{was used to assess}} regional LV function, was expressed as percent control, and was measured with chronically implanted <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>crystals.</b> RMBF was measured with 8 - to 10 -jun radioactive microspheres. In regions with a moderate degree of functional loss, NET fell to 35. 3 ± 2. 2 % of control at 5 minutes when RMBF fell from 1. 19 ± 0. 08 to 0. 86 ± 0. 09 ml/g per min (P < 0. 05). No significant change occurred in midwall or epicardial RMBF. The relationship between endocardial flow and NET was non-linear (r- 0. 89, P < 0. 0001). In these segments, subsequent changes in RMBF were unrelated to corresponding functional alterations through 24 hours. In segments with paradoxic systolic wall thinning RMBF fell in endocardial, midwall, and epicardial layers; endocardial ischemia was most severe (0. 30 ± 0. 0 S ml/g per min). Segmental myocellular necrosis was most severe in the endocardial layer and correlated significantly with both RMBF and segmental function. Myocellular necrosis increased in severity as flow was reduced below 70 - 76 % of normal. Thus, in this model of LV ischemia, (1) regional LV functional loss is most sensitive to reductions in endocardial RMBF; (2...|$|R

40|$|Background. We used implantable {{miniature}} ultra-sonic transducers {{to measure}} longitudinal distance, circumference, and wall thickness dynamically in vivo in canine jejunum. We hoped to differentiate circular from longitudinal smooth muscle contractions and to correlate physical measurements {{of change in}} dis-tance within the jejunal wall with intraluminal manometry. Materials and methods. In acute experiments {{at the time of}} celiotomy, longitudinal distances, circumfer-ences, and wall thickness were measured directly and by ultrasonic transducers sewn to serosa and mucosa. Measurements were obtained with the intestine empty and after distention with air, water, or semisolid slurry. In chronic in vivo experiments in conscious dogs with indwelling ultrasonic transducers and in-traluminal manometers, sonometric dimensions were correlated with manometric recordings. In acute ex-periments, sonometric measurements were similar to direct measurements. In chronic experiments in vivo, smallest ultrasonometric measurements of circumfer-ences of the jejunum correlated in a phase-locked tem-poral manner with both highest intraluminal pres-sures and greatest wall thickness. Results. Longitudinal distances increased during de-creases in circumference. Distances orad to the site maximal intraluminal pressure peaked at 0. 58 0. 04 s (x SEM) before, and those aborad to this point 0. 42 0. 04 s after attaining minimum circumferences. Conclusions. <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>crystals</b> can monitor geo-metric changes in the bowel wall with certain limita-tions, especially when obtained in vivo.

40|$|AbstractEmploying the {{new concept}} of {{systolic}} myocardial stiffness, this study addresses {{the questions of}} linearity of the end-systolic stress-strain relations in left ventricular hypertrophy and the preload dependence of fiber shortening rate. Pressure overload hypertrophy was induced in six puppies by banding the ascending aorta. <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>crystals</b> were implanted for measurement of short axis and wall thickness in the six dogs with hypertrophy and in five control dogs. A pressure catheter was inserted through the apex for left ventricular pressure measurement. Load was altered by graded infusions of phenylephrine {{in the setting of}} betaadrenergic blockade. Linearity of the end-systolic stress-strain relations was observed in all cases, and preload-corrected shortening rate-afterload relations were derived from these stress-strain relations. Without preload correction, mid wall and endocardial shortening rate were depressed (p < 0. 05 and p < 0. 005, respectively) in the hypertrophy group. However, with preload correction at 35 g/cm 2, {{there was no significant difference}} in shortening rate between the control and hypertrophy groups at afterloads of 150, 200 and 250 g/cm 2. Endocardial shortening rate at a preload of 25 versus 35 g/cm 2 demonstrated a preload dependence in both the control (p < 0. 04) and the hypertrophy group (p < 0. 01). Mid wall shortening rate displayed a preload dependence only in the hypertrophy group (p < 0. 05). It is concluded that end-systolic stress-strain relations are linear in control conditions and in hypertrophy, fiber shortening rate is preload-dependent and, thus, shortening rate-afterload relations currently used to assess myocardial contractility need to be modified to account for these preload effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{mechanical}} circulatory support on left ventricular (LV) function was evaluated during prolonged myocardial ischaemia. Regional wall thickening {{of a normal}} and an ischaemic LV region were determined in eight calves (mean body weight 76 kg) using pairs of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>crystals.</b> LV end-diastolic (mmHg) and peak systolic (mmHg) pressure as well as maximum dP/dt (mmHg s- 1) were calculated from LV high-fidelity pressure tracings. The left circumflex coronary artery was ligated proximally for 6 h and reperfused for 18 h. Circulatory support by the assist device was performed {{from the beginning of}} ischaemia {{to the end of the}} experiment. After a mean time of 4 h all animals showed ventricular fibrillation, which was converted successfully in six animals after a mean time interval of 5 h. Five animals survived after 24 h. The non-surviving animals had larger infarcts, greater creatine kinase release and a larger drop in cardiac output during ischaemia. Haemodynamic measurements were carried out after turning off the assist device. Inotropic stimulation with 0. 68 mg. min- 1 dopamine i. v. was performed at the end of the study. LV regional function showed systolic bulging during myocardial ischaemia. After 18 h of reperfusion, the ischaemic wall recovered and showed normal systolic wall thickening in the presence of an increased LV preload. LV relaxation was prolonged after reperfusion, suggesting diastolic dysfunction. It is concluded that mechanical circulatory support is effective in protecting myocardial function during prolonged ischaemia in approximately two-thirds of the animals, despite severe ischaemic ventricular dysfunction and intermittent ventricular fibrillation...|$|R
30|$|Two {{pairs of}} <b>ultrasonic</b> {{dimension}} <b>crystals</b> {{were placed on}} the endocardial and epicardial surfaces of the left ventricle in order to record regional wall thickness and function. One pair was placed in the zone of the myocardium perfused by LCx that would eventually become the ischemia-reperfusion zone (IRZ), and the other pair was placed in the zone perfused by the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) that served as the normal zone (NZ). The pinger of each pair of crystals was located on the epicardial surface, and the receiver was located on the endocardial surface. The crystals were connected to a 4 channel sonomicrometer (Model 120, Triton Technology, San Diego, CA, USA).|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesIn {{minimally}} invasive and robotic mitral valve surgery, a blade retractor {{is used to}} elevate the left atrial roof, which often distorts tissue and impairs visualization. We tested the hemodynamic and histologic changes of intra-atrial suction, using a new suction retractor that may improve stabilization and visualization. MethodsSwine were divided into 3 equal (n = 4) groups: blade retractor, suction retractor, and arrested heart control. Left atrial <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>crystals</b> were used to record ejection fractions. After cardioplegic arrest, the atrium was opened and sampled for preretractor histology. Retractors remained in place for 1 hour, followed by postretractor histologic sampling. Controls were crossclamped for an equivalent time and postarrest histologic data obtained. Animals were weaned from bypass, data were collected for 4 hours, and postsacrifice atrial histologic samples were obtained. ResultsThe main effect due to treatment {{was not statistically significant}} (P =. 52) between the 3 groups, with the 4 -hour average ejection fraction for blade retractor, suction retractor, and control being statistically equivalent at 33. 3 % ± 8. 3, 35. 3 % ± 12. 1, and 40. 8 % ± 9. 9 (mean ± standard deviation), respectively. Histology showed equivalent amounts of myocyte fragmentation, interstitial edema, eosinophilia, and wavy fibers between blade retraction and suction retraction, while the latter showed slightly increased amounts of hemorrhage. ConclusionsAtrial endocardial suction retraction appears to be safe with no acute changes in the left atrial ejection fraction or significant acute histologic differences, compared to blade retraction. Furthermore, intra-atrial suction may be applicable to procedures other than {{minimally invasive}} and robotic mitral valve repair for providing improved stabilization...|$|R
