5|$|If {{dropping}} {{the requirement for}} the <b>uniqueness</b> of the solution, 41-clue minimal pseudo-puzzles are known to exist, {{but they can be}} completed to more than one solution grid. Removal of any clue increases the number of the completions and from this perspective none of the 41 clues is redundant. With slightly more than half the grid filled with givens (41 of 81 cells), the <b>uniqueness</b> of the solution constraint still dominates over the minimality constraint.|$|E

5|$|Two {{important}} {{consequences of}} the group axioms are the <b>uniqueness</b> of the identity element and the <b>uniqueness</b> of inverse elements. There can be only one identity element in a group, and each element in a group has exactly one inverse element. Thus, it is customary {{to speak of the}} identity, and the inverse of an element.|$|E

5|$|The {{result of}} this power is {{a high level of}} {{organizational}} and policy standardization among the different local jurisdictions allowing them to preserve the <b>uniqueness</b> of their prefecture, city, or town. Some of the more collectivist jurisdictions, such as Tokyo and Kyoto, have experimented with policies in such areas as social welfare that later were adopted by the national government.|$|E
25|$|<b>Uniqueness</b> versus {{universality}} – This question {{discusses the}} extent of each human's individuality (<b>uniqueness)</b> or similarity in nature (universality). Gordon Allport, Abraham Maslow, and Carl Rogers were all advocates of the <b>uniqueness</b> of individuals.

25|$|One {{possible}} issue facing bite mark {{analysis is}} a lack of bite mark <b>uniqueness</b> in any given population. Bite mark analysis is based on the assumptions that the dental characteristics of anterior teeth involved in biting are unique amongst individuals, and this asserted <b>uniqueness</b> is transferred and recorded in the injury. However, there is very little reliable research to support these assumptions. A study performed by MacFarlane et al. supported the notion of dental <b>uniqueness,</b> but the study revolved around the visual assessment of a cast as opposed to the bite mark that could have been produced by the cast. In another study conducted by Sognnaes et al., the group tried to find <b>uniqueness</b> between the dental profiles of identical twins in an attempt to prove dental <b>uniqueness</b> in the general population. However, this study suffered from a small sample size (n=5), with the intent to extrapolate the data to the general population. They also used plaster of paris as the substrate to simulate skin, yet the two materials have very different properties. In a review conducted by Strom, he references a study conducted by Berg and Schaidt which suggested that at least four to five teeth need to be present in the mark to ensure its <b>uniqueness</b> and make a positive identification. However, this study was done long before many of the current evaluation methods, and this sheds doubt on how applicable these conclusions are today.|$|E
25|$|During the Meiji {{restoration}} the Nihonjinron philosophy took prevalence. It {{emphasizes the}} <b>uniqueness</b> of the Japanese. This <b>uniqueness</b> has {{been attributed to}} many different factors. Suzuki attributed it to Zen. In his view, Zen embodies the ultimate essence of all philosophy and religion. He pictured Zen as a unique expression of Asian spirituality, which was considered to be superior to the western ways of thinking.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} and <b>uniqueness</b> (up to scaling) of a left Haar measure was first proven in full generality by André Weil. Weil's proof used the {{axiom of choice}} and Henri Cartan furnished a proof which avoided its use. Cartan's proof also establishes the {{existence and}} the <b>uniqueness</b> simultaneously. A simplified and complete account of Cartan's argument was given by Alfsen in 1963. The special case of invariant measure for second countable locally compact groups had been shown by Haar in 1933.|$|E
