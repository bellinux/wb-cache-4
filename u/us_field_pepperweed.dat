40|$|<b>Field</b> <b>pepperweed</b> (Lepidium campestre L.) is a cruciferous winter annual wild edible plant. It has {{potential}} medicinal properties as {{it contains a}} considerable level of glucoraphanin, which is the precursor for sulforaphane, a phase 2 protein inducer. Phase 2 proteins {{either directly or indirectly}} promote the scavenging of strong oxidants, and thus decrease the risk of many complex disorders such as atherosclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease. However, <b>field</b> <b>pepperweed</b> plants also contain glucosinalbin, an antinutritional compound. For <b>field</b> <b>pepperweed</b> to become a green vegetable crop or source of functional food, it is desirable to reduce or eliminate glucosinalbin. The biosynthesis of glucosinalbin may be down-regulated through biotechnology. To that end, in the present studies, experimental protocols for plant regeneration and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation have been developed for <b>field</b> <b>pepperweed.</b> Establishment of such methods represents a vital first step in the process of engineering <b>field</b> <b>pepperweed</b> for enhanced nutritional value. The effect of explant type and various combinations of growth regulators on regeneration were evaluated in three accessions of <b>field</b> <b>pepperweed</b> (Ames 13179, 13180 and 15718). Among the three genotypes, accession Ames 13179 had the highest regeneration frequency under several conditions. Regeneration from hypocotyl explants was more rapid and prolific than regeneration from either mature leaf or cotyledonary explants. Segments from the acropetal end of the hypocotyls were more regenerable than those from the basipetal end. Evaluation of different hormonal combinations and concentrations identified an optimal growth regulator combination (3 mg L- 1 thidiazuron / 0. 1 mg L- 1 naphthalene acetic acid) for shoot induction. The plant regeneration system established was adopted for <b>field</b> <b>pepperweed</b> transformation using the acropetal segments of hypocotyls as explants. Two plant expression constructs were tested for down-regulating by RNA interference with the expression of a <b>field</b> <b>pepperweed</b> cytochrome P 450 gene named LcCYP 79 B 2. This gene may be involved in biosynthesis of glucosinalbin. Conditions for transformation such as pre-culture, co-cultivation time, and antibiotic concentration were evaluated. Transgenic plants were obtained and confirmed by histochemical staining of the reporter â-glucuranidase activity and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) analysis of the NPTII gene. The current study has established efficient plant regeneration and transformation protocols for <b>field</b> <b>pepperweed.</b> They should be useful for future molecular biology studies and biotechnological applications in this species...|$|R

50|$|Lepidium campestre (field pepperwort or <b>field</b> <b>pepperweed)</b> is {{an annual}} {{plant in the}} Brassicaceae or mustard family, native to Europe, but {{commonly}} found in North America as an invasive weed.

50|$|The stem of <b>field</b> <b>pepperweed</b> {{comes out}} of a basal rosette of toothed leaves. The stem is covered in leaves, which are sessile, {{alternate}} and arrow-shaped. The entire plant is generally between 20 and 60 cm tall and covered in small hairs.|$|R

40|$|Cold vapor {{generation}} {{arising from}} reduction of both Hg 2 + and CH 3 Hg+ occurs using ultrasonic (<b>US)</b> <b>fields</b> of sufficient density to achieve both localized heating {{as well as}} radical-based attack in solutions of formic and acetic acids and tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH). A batch sonoreactor utilizing an ultrasonic probe as an energy source and a flow through system based on a US bath were optimized for this purpose. Reduction of CH 3 Hg+ to Hg 0 occurs only at relatively high <b>US</b> <b>field</b> density (> 10 W cm 2 ̆ 2123 of sample solution) and is thus not observed when a conventional US bath is used for cold vapor generation. Speciation of mercury is thus possible by altering the power density during the measurement process. Thermal reduction of Hg 2 + is efficient in formic acid and TMAH at 70 0 C and occurs {{in the absence of}} the <b>US</b> <b>field.</b> Room temperature studies with the batch sonoreactor reveal a slow reduction process, producing temporally broad signals having an efficiency of approximately 68...|$|R
