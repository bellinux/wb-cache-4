25|$|At the party, Bender is overheard {{saying that}} all the robots are doomed, causing panic. Farnsworth arrives with Fry and Leela and {{delivers}} {{a solution to the}} robots; every last one needs to blast their exhaust vents at the same time, straight <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> in order to push the Earth farther from the Sun, thus cooling the Earth and causing the EMP cannon to miss its target. During the panic Bender and the turtle are knocked onto their backs and cannot get up, leaving not enough exhaust to move the Earth. As Bender is lamenting his fate, the turtle rocks from side to side and rolls to its feet. Shocked and inspired, but not to be shown up, Bender does the same, allowing him to release his massive exhaust, just barely saving the robots from the EMP. Farnsworth receives a medal of pollution for his work, and the extra week caused by the new orbit of the Earth is declared Robot Party Week.|$|E

25|$|In Greek mythology, {{the myths}} {{associated}} with Scorpio almost invariably also contain {{a reference to}} Orion. According {{to one of these}} myths it is written that Orion boasted to goddess Artemis and her mother, Leto, that he would kill every animal on the Earth. Although Artemis was known to be a hunter herself she offered protection to all creatures. Artemis and her mother Leto sent a scorpion to deal with Orion. The pair battled and the scorpion killed Orion. However, the contest was apparently a lively one that caught the attention of the king of the gods Zeus, who later raised the scorpion to heaven and afterwards, at the request of Artemis, did the same for Orion to serve as a reminder for mortals to curb their excessive pride. There is also a version that Orion was better than the goddess Artemis but said that Artemis was better than he and so Artemis took a liking to Orion. The god Apollo, Artemis's twin brother, grew angry and sent a scorpion to attack Orion. After Orion was killed, Artemis asked Zeus to put Orion <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> So every winter Orion hunts in the sky, but every summer he flees as the constellation of the scorpion comes.|$|E
500|$|Docter {{revealed}} that the filmmakers' first story outline had Carl [...] "just want to join his wife <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> It was almost a kind of strange suicide mission or something. And obviously that's [...] Once he gets airborne, then what? So {{we had to have}} some goal for him to achieve that he had not yet gotten." [...] As a result, they added the plot of going to South America. The location was chosen due to both Docter's love of tropical locations, but also in wanting a location that Carl could be stuck with a kid due to the inability to leave him with an authority such as a police officer or social worker. They implemented a child character as a way to help Carl stop being [...] "stuck in his ways".|$|E
500|$|The song {{has gained}} {{attention}} {{due to its}} explicit lyrics. The song begins with the lyrics [...] "I got a body full of liquor and a cocaine kicker", during the song [...] "a slew of f-bombs" [...] can be heard, and varied graphic descriptions such as: [...] "You got your legs <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> with the devil in your eyes / Let me hear {{you say you want}} it all" [...] and the chorus [...] "You and me, baby, making love like gorillas!". Overall, the lyrics portray the subject of having a [...] "romantic evening" [...] of making love like wild animals (gorillas), despite being high from cocaine and drunk from liquor. On September 11, 2013, The Daily Telegraph reported that Dannielle Miller, co-founder of Enlighten Education, decided to appeal to mainstream radio in order to ban [...] "Gorilla", due to its sexual and violent lyrics towards women.|$|E

500|$|Quesada {{confirmed}} in April 2014 that the Netflix series {{would be set}} within the MCU. Loeb explained that [...] "Within the Marvel universe {{there are thousands of}} heroes of all shapes and sizes, but the Avengers are here to save the universe and Daredevil is here to save the neighborhood ... It does take place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's all connected. But that doesn't necessarily mean that we would look <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> and see [...] It's just a different part of New York that we have not yet seen in the Marvel movies." [...] In January 2015, Netflix COO Ted Sarandos said Netflix planned to release a Marvel series approximately a year apart from each other after Daredevils April 2015 release. A year later, Sarandos noted that the release schedules of the Marvel Netflix series are dependent on the [...] "long production times and long post times. In some cases, when we have characters crossover, it makes it more difficult to manage production. It's not the goal to put out {{more than one or two}} [...] year ... The complex one is really The Defenders. The Defenders production schedule will determine a lot of the season 2 and 3 output of those shows." [...] He also noted on potential spin-offs that [...] "all the characters in the universe could also spin out" [...] into their own series at some point, with Netflix ordering Marvel's The Punisher, a spin-off from Daredevil, that April. Sarandos later stated that Netflix was trying to close the gap between releases of Marvel seasons, but would always prioritize the quality of the series over higher numbers of releases per year. He also said that Netflix was open to exploring the MCU beyond the Defenders series, including potential crossovers with ABC's Marvel series.|$|E

[...] "It felt like an atomic bomb with four F-16s coming one way and another four from the {{opposite}} direction, weaving between the houses. At this point, we realized we were not surviving. We said our last prayers, and that was it. Because we know that when the Israelis lose one of their soldiers they become lunatics. We just knew they had suffered something, we could sense it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2002, St. Martin of Tours was {{the site}} of the funeral of Los Angeles Lakers {{announcer}} Chick Hearn. [...] The funeral mass was given by Cardinal Roger M.

Gray Davis, Vin Scully, John Wooden, and Jack Nicholson. [...] In addition to 400 present at St. Martin, the funeral was simulcast to 19,000 fans at Staples Center and broadcast on Los Angeles television stations.

Despite going down after being struck, the stallion is able to get back as the horse bites on and tears the carpet apart. All four of them start to plunge.|$|R

2500|$|The {{decision}} to have Ibrahim {{burned at the stake}} was affirmed by the temple priests and the king of Babylon, Nimrod. The news spread like fire in the kingdom and people were coming from all places to watch the execution. A huge pit was dug up and a large quantity of wood was piled up. Then the biggest fire people ever witnessed was lit. The flames were so high <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> that even the birds could not fly over it for fear of being burnt themselves. Ibrahim's hands and feet were chained, and he was put in a catapult, ready to be thrown in. During this time, Angel Jibril came to him and said: [...] "O Ibrahim! Is there anything you wish for?" [...] Ibrahim could have asked to be saved from the fire or to be taken away, but Ibrahim replied, [...] "Allah is sufficient for me, He is the best disposer of my affairs." [...] The catapult was released and Ibrahim was thrown into the fire. Allah then gave an order to the fire, [...] "O fire! Be coolness and safety for Ibrahim." [...] A miracle occurred, the fire obeyed and burned only his chains. Ibrahim came out from it as if he was coming out from a garden, peaceful, his face illuminated and not a trace of smoke on his clothes. People watched in shock and exclaimed: [...] "Amazing! Ibrahim's God has saved him from the fire!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Daredevil is {{the first}} of the ordered Netflix series, and is {{followed}} by Marvel's Jessica Jones, Marvel's Luke Cage, and Marvel's Iron Fist, which lead to the miniseries, Marvel's The Defenders. In November 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that, if the characters prove popular on Netflix, [...] "It's quite possible that they could become feature films," [...] which Sarandos echoed in July 2015. In August 2014, D'Onofrio stated that after the [...] "series stuff with Netflix", Marvel has [...] "a bigger plan to branch out". In December 2014, Loeb explained that [...] "Within the Marvel universe there are thousands of heroes of all shapes and sizes, but the Avengers are here to save the universe and Daredevil is here to save the neighborhood ... It does take place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's all connected. But that doesn't necessarily mean that we would look <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> and see [...] It's just a different part of New York that we have not yet seen in the Marvel movies." [...] Dawson later elaborated that [...] "When you've got that level of superpowers, the fighting is different, the stakes are different, and it has a grander feel. In that world, they exist in it, so they know it and it's normal to them. But in reality when people are fighting and doing really bad, elicit [...] crimes on the ground and there are guns and drugs—bones are going to break. People aren't hitting each other and nothing's going to happen because they're indestructible. These are people. They're vulnerable and you get to experience that." ...|$|E
