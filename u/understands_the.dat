Its humor was also highlighted by many critics.|$|E

Tara, {{described}} as lustrous like the moon, is praised by Vali as one who <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> language of all creatures and is astute to clarify her statement. Tara warns him about Sugriva's alliance with Rama and the plotting of Vali's death {{at the hands of}} Sugriva and his advisers. Vali not only disregards Tara's advice, but also suspects Tara of cheating on him with Sugriva. Vali leaves, speaking harshly to Tara.|$|E

5|$|The next day, Peter {{gets the}} Lizard photos {{published}} in the Bugle and gets the money he needs. However, when Gwen, Eddie, and the Connors find out, they are outraged that he ran off simply to take pictures and say he has lost their trust. Although Martha <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> difficult choices that Peter had, she fires him. He secretly grabs another vial of gene cleanser and returns home, frustrated about his reputation. Blaming the events that gave him his powers, {{he is about to}} take the vial when he sees a photo of himself with Ben. Realizing that he had saved Curt either way, he decides that Spider-Man is needed and hides the vial under his desk.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Aquinas, while proposing five proofs of God's {{existence}} in his Summa Theologica, objected to Anselm's argument. He suggested that people cannot know {{the nature of}} God and, therefore, cannot conceive of God in the way Anselm proposed. The ontological argument would be meaningful only to someone who <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> essence of God completely. Aquinas reasoned that, as only God can completely know His essence, only He could use the argument. His rejection of the ontological argument caused other Catholic theologians to also reject the argument.|$|E
50|$|Engineering is {{traditionally}} decompositional. To <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> whole, it is first broken into its parts. One then masters the parts {{and puts them}} back together, becoming {{the master of the}} whole.Industrial and systems engineering's (ISE) approach is the opposite; any one part cannot be <b>understood</b> without <b>the</b> context of the whole. Changes in one part affect the whole, and the role of a part is a projection into the whole. In traditional engineering, people <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> parts first, then they can <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> whole. In ISE, they <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> whole first, and then they can <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> role of each part.|$|R

5|$|After {{a fierce}} battle, Ozai slams Aang into a rock, hitting the {{scar on his}} back from Azula's {{lightning}} in the previous season and inadvertently releasing his locked seventh chakra, allowing Aang to enter the Avatar State. With the combined power of his past lives, Aang quickly overwhelms Ozai but refuses to kill him. After subduing Ozai, Aang finally <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> lion-turtle's meaning and uses energybending to strip Ozai of his Firebending powers, removing his ability to wage war while Sozin's Comet vanishes beyond the horizon. During his coronation, Zuko promises to aid {{the world in the}} postwar reconstruction. A final scene depicts the main cast gathered in Iroh's new tea shop, while Aang and Katara begin a romantic relationship.|$|E
5|$|When Ra.One {{undergoes}} final tests, Akashi notices unusual glitches but {{chooses to}} ignore them. When {{the game is}} officially launched, it receives a standing ovation from the audience; an enamored Prateek insists on playing it immediately. He logs in under the ID Lucifer and proceeds to the second level, but is interrupted by Akashi. Ra.One, unable to end his turn with Lucifer and angry that a player has proceeded so far, becomes determined that Lucifer will die. He uses a wireless technology (which Jenny had introduced in a conference) to enter the real world, a process which causes the mainframe to malfunction. Akashi informs Shekhar, who partially <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> situation and rushes home, fearing for his son's life. Meanwhile, Ra.One murders Akashi and assumes his appearance; he goes to find Lucifer, and meets Shekhar in the process. In an attempt to save his son, Shekhar claims that he is Lucifer, but his lie is exposed when Ra.One scans his identity card. Consequently, Ra.One kills Shekhar and makes {{it look like a}} car accident.|$|E

25|$|Heidegger <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> {{commencement}} {{of the history}} of Western philosophy as a brief period of authentic openness to being, {{during the time of the}} pre-Socratics, especially Anaximander, Heraclitus, and Parmenides.
