40|$|Metrology for Chemical Pollutants in Air (MACPoll) {{is a joint}} {{research}} project of the European Metrology Research Programme of EURAMET that among other activities deals with low-cost gas sensors for air quality monitoring. Gas sensors are identified as emerging measuring devices for “indicative measurements” regulated in the Air Quality Directive. Compared to reference measurements, gas sensors would allow air pollution monitoring at a lower cost. The Directive allows using indicative measurements without restriction in the zones where the <b>upper</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>threshold</b> (UAT) is not exceeded while they permit a reduction of 50 % of the minimum reference measurements where the UAT is exceeded. The Directive does not specify any indicative method but it requires to demonstrate that they can meet a data quality objective (DQO) that is about twice less stringent than the one of reference methods. The DQO {{is defined as a}} relative expanded uncertainty. Since the Directive does not give any guidance for this demonstration, within MACPoll it has been decided to draft a protocol for the evaluation of gas sensors. JRC. H. 2 -Air and Climat...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Assessment and {{intervention}} thresholds are developed and proposed in men aged over 50 years and postmenopausal {{women for the}} UK based on fracture probability from the WHO fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX). INTRODUCTION: The FRAX tool has recently become available to compute the 10 -year probability of fractures in {{men and women from}} clinical risk factors (CRFs) with or without the measurement of femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD). The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a case-finding strategy for men and women from the UK at high risk of osteoporotic fracture by delineating the fracture probabilities at which BMD testing or intervention should be recommended. METHODS: Fracture probabilities were computed using the FRAX tool calibrated to the epidemiology of fracture and death in the UK. The relationship between cost effectiveness and fracture probability used the source data from a prior publication that examined the cost effectiveness of generic alendronate in the UK. An intervention threshold was set by age in men and women, based on the fracture probability equivalent to that of women with a history of a prior osteoporosis related fracture. In addition, assessment thresholds for the use of BMD testing were explored. Assessment thresholds for the measurement of BMD followed current practice guidelines where individuals were considered to be eligible for assessment in the presence of one or more CRF. An <b>upper</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>threshold</b> (i. e. a fracture probability above which patients could be treated without recourse to BMD) was based on optimisation of the positive predictive value of the assessment tool. The consequences of assessment {{and intervention}} thresholds on the requirement for BMD test and interventions were assessed using the distribution of clinical risk factors and femoral neck BMD for women in the source cohorts used for the development of the FRAX models RESULTS: Treatment was cost effective at all ages when the 10 -year probability of a major fracture exceeded 7 %. The intervention threshold at the age of 50 years corresponded to a 10 -year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture of 7. 5 %. This rose progressively with age to 30 % at the age of 80 years, so that intervention was cost effective at all ages. Assessment thresholds for testing with BMD (6 - 9 % at the age of 50 years) also rose with age (18 - 36 % at the age of 80 years). The use of these thresholds in a case-finding strategy would identify 6 - 20 % of women as eligible for BMD testing and 23 - 46 % as eligible for treatment, depending on age. The same threshold can be used in men. CONCLUSION: The study provides a method of developing management algorithms for osteoporosis from the estimation of fracture probabilities, rather than those based on BMD alone or BMD with single or multiple CRF...|$|E
40|$|In general, {{air quality}} is {{determined}} from {{the concentrations of}} pollutants in ambient air.

40|$|Summary: Many current {{guidelines}} {{for the assessment of}} osteoporosis, including those in Kuwait, initiate fracture risk assessment in men and women using BMD T-score thresholds. We compared the Kuwaiti guidelines with FRAX-based age-dependent intervention thresholds equivalent to that in women with a prior fragility fracture. FRAX-based intervention thresholds identified women at higher fracture probability than fixed T-score thresholds, particularly in the elderly. Purpose: A FRAX® model been recently calibrated for Kuwait, but guidance is needed on how to utilise fracture probabilities in the assessment and treatment of patients. Methods: We compared age-specific fracture probabilities, equivalent to women with no clinical risk factors and a prior fragility fracture (without BMD), with the age-specific fracture probabilities associated with femoral neck T-scores of − 2. 5 and − 1. 5 SD, in line with current guidelines in Kuwait. <b>Upper</b> and lower <b>assessment</b> <b>thresholds</b> for BMD testing were additionally explored using FRAX. Results: When a BMD T-score of − 2. 5 SD was used as an intervention threshold, FRAX probabilities of a major osteoporotic fracture in women aged 50 years were approximately twofold higher than those in women of the same age but with an average BMD. The increase in risk associated with the BMD threshold decreased progressively with age such that, at the age of 83 years or more, a T-score of − 2. 5 SD was associated with a lower probability of fracture than that of the age-matched general population with no clinical risk factors. The same phenomenon was observed from the age of 66 years at a T-score of − 1. 5 SD. A FRAX-based intervention threshold, defined as the 10 -year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture in a woman of average BMI with a previous fracture, rose with age from 4. 3 % at the age of 50 years to 23 %, at the age of 90 years, and identified women at increased risk at all ages. Qualitatively comparable findings were observed in the case of hip fracture probability and in men. Conclusion: Intervention thresholds based on BMD alone do not optimally target women at higher fracture risk than those on age-matched individuals without clinical risk factors, particularly in the elderly. In contrast, intervention thresholds based on fracture probabilities equivalent to a ‘fracture threshold’ consistently target women at higher fracture risk, irrespective of age...|$|R

The collected PM 10 24 -h samples were analyzed for nine toxic metals and metalloids (Pb, As, Cd, Ni, Cr, Mn, V, CLI, Hg). Concerning the five elements regulated by the European Union, annual average concentrations of Ph were found below the limit values at all sites, Cd and Ni concentrations were lower than the prospective <b>assessment</b> <b>thresholds</b> at all sites, concentrations of As exceeded the <b>assessment</b> <b>threshold</b> at two sites, while concentrations of Hg were found below detection limits in all samples. Concentration levels of Mn and V were {{in compliance with the}} values proposed by the World Health Organization. The seasonal and spatial variability of metal concentrations was examined and site-specific correlation analysis was conducted for the identification of metals with similar origin. The association between trace metals and NO, concentrations was explored to account for the impact of automotive sources, at two traffic-impacted sites. Cu was the metal most closely linked with the road transport sector. The relation of concentration levels with the prevalence of winds from different sectors was studied in an effort to investigate the transport of metal particles from various zones of the city. Finally, factor analysis was carried out to extract the main components responsible for the variance of the dataset and to attribute them to specific source categories, with vehicle-related sources being important in all cases.

40|$|The {{concentrations}} {{of the heavy}} metals arsenic, cadmium, nickel and mercury in ambient air in the Netherlands are so low that only one sampling point is required to meet the European directive. For benzo(a) pyrene at least three sampling points are needed. This is the conclusion of RIVM in this report, in which observed values are compared with thresholds from the European directive. Based on this analysis, the Ministry of Housing, Spatial planning and the Environment decides how many sampling points {{will be used to}} meet the European requirements. Arsenic, cadmium, nickel and benzo(a) pyrene are carcinogenic and mercury is poisonous. Therefore, the European Union has formulated target values and obligations for monitoring for these substances. Monitoring must start in 2007. The Dutch Air Quality Monitoring Network (LML) of RIVM has monitored the substances between 2000 and 2005. The observations indicate that the {{concentrations of}} heavy metals are so low that they are below the lower <b>assessment</b> <b>thresholds.</b> This implies that a minimal number of sampling points is needed. For the Netherlands one point is sufficient. RIVM suggests the location Kollumerwaard since it fits in with the European monitoring programme EMEP/Osparcom. For benzo(a) pyrene concentrations are below the target value but not everywhere below the lower <b>assessment</b> <b>threshold.</b> The threshold is exceeded along busy roads, as observed at Rotterdam Bentinckplein, and around the terrain of Corus in IJmuiden.

Quantitative sensory testing is a variant of conventional sensory testing wherein the goal is the quantification {{of the level of}} stimulation needed to produce a particular sensation.

The right side was significantly more sensitive in the lateral part of the leg (p = 0. 011) and the left side in the medial part of the arm (p = 0. 022). There were also significant differences between sites (p < 0. 001), whereby distal parts of the body were more sensitive.

40|$|Abstract—Recently, tuning {{the clear}} channel <b>assessment</b> (CCA) <b>threshold</b> in {{conjunction}} with power control has been considered for improving the performance of WLANs. However, we show that, CCA tuning can be exploited by selfish nodes to obtain an unfair share of the available bandwidth. Specifically, a selfish entity can manipulate the CCA threshold to ignore ongoing transmissions; this increases the probability of accessing the medium and provides the entity a higher, unfair share of the bandwidth. We experiment on our 802. 11 testbed to characterize the effects of CCA tuning on both isolated links and in 802. 11 WLAN configurations. We focus on AP-client(s) configurations, proposing a novel approach to detect this misbehavior. A misbehaving client is unlikely to recognize low power receptions as legitimate packets; by intelligently sending low power probe messages, an AP can efficiently detect a misbehaving node. Our key contributions are: 1) We {{are the first to}} quantify the impact of selfish CCA tuning via extensive experimentation on various 802. 11 configurations. 2) We propose a lightweight scheme for detecting selfish nodes that inappropriately increase their CCAs. 3) We extensively evaluate our system on our testbed; its accuracy is 95 percent while the false positive rate is less than 5 percent.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of {{programmability}} in radios, it is be-coming easier for wireless network nodes to cheat to obtain an unfair share of the bandwidth. In this work we study the widely used 802. 11 protocol and present a solution to detect selfish carrier-sensing behavior where a node raises the CCA (clear channel <b>assessment)</b> <b>threshold</b> for carrier-sensing, or simply does not sense carrier (possibly ran-domly to avoid detection). Our approach is based on de-tecting any asymmetry in carrier-sense behavior between node pairs and finding multiple such witnesses to raise con-fidence. The approach is completely passive. It requires deploying multiple sniffers across the network to capture wireless traffic traces. These traces are then analyzed by using a machine learning approach to infer carrier-sense relationships between network nodes. Evaluations using a real testbed as well as ns 2 simulation studies demonstrate excellent detection ability.

40|$|Summary: Under current guidelines, {{based on}} prior {{fracture}} probability thresholds, inequalities in access to therapy arise especially at older ages (≥ 70 years) {{depending on the}} presence or absence of a prior fracture. An alternative threshold (a fixed threshold from the age of 70 years) reduces this disparity, increases treatment access and decreases the need for bone densitometry. Introduction: Several international guidelines set age-specific intervention thresholds at the 10 -year probability of fracture equivalent to a woman of average BMI with a prior fracture. At older ages (≥ 70 years), women with prior fracture selected for treatment are at lower average absolute risk than those selected for treatment in the absence of prior fracture, prompting consideration of alternative thresholds in this age group.
