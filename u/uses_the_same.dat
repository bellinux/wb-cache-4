5|$|Test Track soft-opened to {{the public}} December 19, 1998 after a long delay due to {{problems}} revealed during testing and changes to the ride design which prevented the ride from opening on its original date, May 1997. Instead, the attraction officially opened on March 17, 1999. Test Track replaced World of Motion, though it <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> ride building.|$|E

5|$|A 3D Classics {{remake of}} Kid Icarus was {{published}} for the Nintendo 3DS handheld console. The remake features stereoscopic 3D along with updated graphics including backgrounds, which the original lacked. It also <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> save system as the Family Computer Disk System version does, {{as opposed to}} the Password system from the NES version. The 3D Classics version also utilizes the Family Computer Disk System's music and sound effects (utilizing the extra sound channel not available in the NES version).|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Nintendo {{released}} Luigi's Mansion Arcade, an arcade game {{based on}} Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon developed by Capcom {{and published by}} Sega. The game <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> plot as Dark Moon, but goes for a first-person, on-rails gameplay style, and utilizes a special vacuum-based controller. The game is mostly exclusive to Japanese arcades, although some cabinets have been localized and released at some specific Dave and Buster's locations in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In France, the Blue Picardy was {{recognised}} as {{a separate}} breed in 1938, and there are about 1000 puppies born in France each year. The first person to import the Blue Picardy Spaniel into Canada was Ronald Meunier of Saint-Julien, Quebec, around 1987, and the breed was then recognised by the Canadian Kennel Club effective 1 June 1995. The breed is recognised by the American Rare Breed Association, which <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> standard as the Fédération Cynologique Internationale.|$|E

Related design and functionality allows 767 pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate the 757 and share the same seniority roster with pilots of either aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Islamic philosopher Carl Ernst {{has argued}} that {{religious}} language is often political, especially in the public sphere, and that its purpose is to persuade people and establish authority, as well as convey information. He explains that the modern criticisms of the West made by some sections of Islam are an ideological reaction to colonialism, which intentionally <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> language as colonialists. Ernst argues that when it is used rhetorically, religious language cannot be taken at face value because of its political implications.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{intended}} to be a spin-off featuring a different protagonist, Resident Evil 3 was designed to have more action-oriented gameplay than previous Resident Evil games. It features a larger number of enemies for the player to defeat and introduces the eponymous Nemesis creature, which periodically pursues the player from one area to the next {{until the end of the}} game. The game <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> engine as its predecessors and features 3D models over pre-rendered backgrounds with fixed camera angles.|$|E

5|$|Shadowrun was {{released}} in North America and Japan by Data East. In PAL regions, it was self-published by Beam Software as Laser Beam Entertainment.

5|$|The SS195LF is {{a commercially}} {{available}} cartridge {{that features a}} lead-free primer and produces ballistics similar to the SS192 round, which it replaced in late 2004. It <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> 1.8-g (28grain) copper-jacketed aluminum core bullet as the SS192, {{and it can be}} identified by the unmarked, hollow void at the tip and the silver-colored primer.

The projectile has a blue-colored polymer tip instead of the red color used in the SS196 projectile tip. The SS197 has been manufactured by Fiocchi, under contract for FN Herstal, since 2006 and it is distributed in the United States by Federal Cartridge Company.|$|E

The Empress <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> flag, except the shape {{is that of a}} swallow tail. The crown prince and the crown princess use the same flags, except with a smaller chrysanthemum and a white border {{in the middle of the}} flags. The chrysanthemum has been associated with the Imperial throne since the rule of Emperor Go-Toba in the 12th century, but it did not become the exclusive symbol of the Imperial throne until 1868.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} written by Chris Stamper, and {{graphics}} were designed by Tim Stamper. Alien 8 <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> image masking technique as Knight Lore, which allows the developers to create composite structures out of stacked images without visual overlay. The technique was copyrighted by Ultimate as the Filmation game engine. As with its spiritual predecessor, the game is rendered isometric projection. The game was critically acclaimed upon release. Reviewers praised the game's graphics and innovation, however minor criticism was directed at its similarities to Knight Lore.|$|E
5|$|Broken Sword spawned four sequels. The first, , was {{released}} in 1997. It <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> engine as the first Broken Sword game. Six years later, Revolution released Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon, which features 3D graphics and a direct-control mechanism. It uses the RenderWare engine. In 2006 the company released Broken Sword: The Angel of Death (Secrets of the Ark: A Broken Sword Game in North America), which returns to the point-and-click system used {{in the first two}} games. It is the only game in the series not released for a console, and it uses Sumo Digital's engine. The fifth installment, , was announced through a Kickstarter project in August 2012. The game features 2D graphics, and it {{was released}} in September 2013.|$|E
5|$|Discovering that Talbot {{has already}} confiscated the painting, Coulson agrees {{to meet with}} him after {{debriefing}} his team. Meanwhile, May follows Talbot, who is actually Hydra agent Sunil Bakshi using advanced technology to take on Talbot's voice and appearance. May is attacked by Agent 33, a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent brainwashed into Hydra's service, who knocks May unconscious and <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> device to take on her voice and appearance. Agent 33 goes to the Bus, a S.H.I.E.L.D. plane being used as a mobile command center, where she secretly plants a computer virus before meeting with Coulson. Further discussing his contingency plan, in which May would kill Coulson and replace him as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Coulson deduces that Agent 33 is not May and turns on her; this draws the attention of Bakshi, who was ready to torture May to gain S.H.I.E.L.D. secrets.|$|E
