40|$|Currently, the United Kingdom has no {{facility}} for {{the disposal of}} any waste above the low level category, indicating that all intermediate and high level waste, apart from spent fuel, has to be stored {{on the site of}} origin. To meet this storage requirement, nuclear sites are resorting to converting existing buildings or contemplating the construction of dedicated facilities, resulting in considerable cost implications. These financing aspects not only concern the construction strategy but also impinge on the ultimate decommissioning costs associated with each particular nuclear site. This paper reports on an investigation to apply the commercially available interlocking hollow block system to the design of a store for drums of radioactive waste. This block system can be quickly, and cost effectively, erected and filled with a choice of dense material. Later, the store can be dismantled with a minimum of disposable radioactive waste and the complete facility re - erected at another location if required, considerably reducing both capital construction and decommissioning costs. The investigation also encompassed a detailed review of the equipment required to place the drums of waste into the store, resulting in a scheme for a remotely operated vehicle that did not rely on <b>umbilical</b> <b>control</b> cables. The drum handler design included for 100 % redundancy of all functions, meaning that whichever component failed, the handler was always recoverable to effect the necessary repair. The ultimate aim of the waste drum store review was to produce a facility that was as safe as a conventionally constructed unit, but at a lower overall building and decommissioning cost...|$|E

40|$|Angiogenesis is a {{critical}} component of the proliferative endometrial phase of the menstrual cycle. Thus, we hypothesized that a stem cell-like population exist and can be isolated from menstrual blood. Mononuclear cells collected from the menstrual blood contained a subpopulation of adherent cells which could be maintained in tissue culture for > 68 doublings and retained expression of the markers CD 9, CD 29, CD 41 a, CD 44, CD 59, CD 73, CD 90 and CD 105, without karyotypic abnormalities.

These cells, which we termed "Endometrial Regenerative Cells" (ERC) were capable of differentiating into 9 lineages: cardiomyocytic, respiratory epithelial, neurocytic, myocytic, endothelial, pancreatic, hepatic, adipocytic, and osteogenic. Additionally, ERC produced MMP 3, MMP 10, GM-CSF, angiopoietin- 2 and PDGF-BB at 10 – 100, 000 fold higher levels than two control cord blood derived mesenchymal stem cell lines.

40|$|Abstract - The {{interaction}} {{in the upper}} ionosphere between the ambient medium and the space station or other orbiting vehicles in the 1990 s will require measurements from essentially nonintrusive instrumentation {{and the ability to}} repeat those measurements at will in an extended region about a space vehicle. A diagnostic package on a communications and <b>control</b> <b>umbilical,</b> a 'spin-cast' diagnostic package (SCDP), can complement free flyers and attached instrumentation in the region from 10 m to 1 km which is prohibited to free flyers. The basic concept for the SCDP is to cast off on an umbilical line in some chosen direction a small, battery powered, instrumentation package and then to reel it back in while taking measurements. A typical package might include pressure monitors, various plasma probes, magnetometers, plasma wave, and optical sensors which could include video imaging. This paper proposes a method for rapid deployment and retrieval of the constrained plasma package. The package follows a 'quasi' free orbit for most of the time while the umbilical is used to impart the required Delta Vs to the package. The paper also proposes a complementary method for collecting data beyond the restricted zone whereby a free-flying plasma package is injected into a moon orbit around the space station...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Somatic cell nuclear {{transfer}} (scNT) -derived piglets have {{high rates of}} mortality, including stillbirth and postnatal death. Here, we examined severe malformed umbilical cords (MUC), {{as well as other}} organs, from nine scNT-derived term piglets. Results Microscopic analysis revealed complete occlusive thrombi and the absence of columnar epithelial layers in MUC (scNT-MUC) derived from scNT piglets. scNT-MUC had significantly lower expression levels of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule- 1 (PECAM- 1) and angiogenesis-related genes than umbilical cords of normal scNT piglets (scNT-N) that survived into adulthood. Endothelial cells derived from scNT-MUC migrated and formed tubules more slowly than endothelial cells from <b>control</b> <b>umbilical</b> cords or scNT-N. Proteomic analysis of scNT-MUC revealed significant down-regulation of proteins involved in the prevention of oxidative stress and the regulation of glycolysis and cell motility, while molecules involved in apoptosis were significantly up-regulated. Histomorphometric analysis revealed severe calcification in the kidneys and placenta, peliosis in the liver sinusoidal space, abnormal stromal cell proliferation in the lungs, and tubular degeneration in the kidneys in scNT piglets with MUC. Increased levels of apoptosis were also detected in organs derived from all scNT piglets with MUC. Conclusion These results suggest that MUC contribute to fetal malformations, preterm birth and low birth weight due to underlying molecular defects that result in hypoplastic umbilical arteries and/or placental insufficiency. The results of the current study demonstrate the effects of MUC on fetal growth and organ development in scNT-derived pigs, and provide important insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying angiogenesis during umbilical cord development. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hyperbilirubinemia is {{a common}} problem in {{neonates}} that affects approximately 60 % of term neonates and 80 % of pre-term neonates {{in the first week}} of life. Newborns, due to prematurity of the liver and digestive tract, could not eliminate bilirubin quickly. This phenomenon leads to hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice during the first days of the birth. Because indirect bilirubin is toxic for central nervous system and is not soluble in water, elimination of it is difficult. Severe hyperbilirubinemia causes kernicterus, mental retardation, hearing loss, cerebral palsy, behavioral disorders and death. The most common method of treatment is phototherapy and in severe cases, is exchange transfusion. In Lorestan province, it is believed that putting barely flour on skin of icteric neonates decreases and sometimes treats icterus state. The observed effect is due to cold nature of barely. The aim of this study is to introduce barely flour therapy to medical society, as one of the traditional methods if it is effective, and to inform Lorestan people and warn them about complications of severe jaundice if it is not effective. Materials and methods: A controlled clinical trial in neonatal ward of Madani pediatric hospital of Korramabad affiliated to Lorestan university of medical sciences was done during a period of one year. During this period, all full-term neonates with indirect bilirubin > 16 mg/dl were studied. Neonates divided into two groups of cases and controls. In the study group, in addition to phototherapy, filtered and fine barely flour was put on whole skin of neonates, except their face and <b>umbilical</b> area. <b>Control</b> group, only treated with phototherapy. Data were collected by questionnaire and laboratory tests. Findings: Ninety neonates including 45 neonates in case and 45 neonates in control groups were studied. Of these, 62 (68. 9 %) were boys and 28 (31. 1 %) were girls. The duration of hospitalization in 44. 4 % of study group was 48 hrs and in 33. 3 % of control group was 96 hrs (4 days). The average of hospitalization period in study group was 2. 7 days. (Minimum 1 day and maximum 4 days with SD= 1. 09) and in control group was 3. 7 days (minimum 2 days and maximum 7 days with SD= 1. 2). Duration of hospitalization of two groups was statistically significant (P= 0. 001). Conclusions: Our study indicated that phototherapy in conjuction with barely flour therapy is more effective than phototherapy alone. But, people must be informed that affected neonates have to be underwent medical therapy, and barely flour therapy alone is not a reliable treatment...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} utility of Doppler {{velocimetry}} and computerized cardiotocography {{in the management of}} intrauterine growth restriction and prediction of neonatal outcome. Patients and methods: Seventy-two pregnant women with fetuses showing growth restriction and delivered within 48 h of their last Doppler velocimetry evaluation. The last computerized cardiotocographic trace from these fetuses was used for statistical analysis, and the last trace from the healthy fetuses of 93 consecutive women undergoing cesarean section was used as <b>control.</b> <b>Umbilical</b> artery pulsatility index (UA PI), middle cerebral artery pulsatility index (MCA PI), UA PI / MCA PI ratio, and uterine artery resistance index (Ut RI) were assessed. Results: Among women with growth-restricted fetuses, all parameters were significantly higher in those who had hypertension; and in those who had diabetes, only the UA PI / MCA ratio was significantly higher. Umbilical artery PI values and the UA PI / MCA ratio were higher in those who had a nonreassuring result to computerized nonstress test immediately before delivery. A multiple logistic analysis showed that the UA PI / MCA ratio was the only Doppler velocimetry parameter predicting cardiotocographic nonreactivity; furthermore, the predictivity of extended newborn hospitalization (longer than 15 days) was verified, with a sensitivity of 56 % and a specificity of 92 % when the ratio was higher than 1. 26. Conclusion: The MCA PI of fetuses with growth restriction should be assessed. The UA PI / MCA ratio is predictive of a nonreactive computerized cardiotocography trace and of prolonged neonatal hospitalization. © 2005 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

MÉTODOS: estudo tipo caso-controle composto por 188 recém-nascidos, sendo que 47 compuseram o grupo casos (pH de artéria {{umbilical}} OBJECTIVES: {{to assess}} maternal risk {{factors associated with}} fetal acidosis. METHODS: a case-control type study was conducted of 188 neonates, of whom 47 comprised the case group (umbilical arterial pH < 7. 0) and 141 the <b>control</b> (<b>umbilical</b> arterial pH E 7. 1 < 7. 3). The study included only single-gestation neonates without congenital malformations. Both maternal and fetal variables were taken into consideration. Statistical analysis involved the calculation of the raw and adjusted Odds Ratio, Student's t-test, the chi-squared test and multivariate analysis using Enter-method non-conditional logistic regression. The level of statistical significance was set at p< 0. 05. RESULTS: in the case group higher percentages of caesarian sections and pre-term births were observed, involving almost {{five times as much}} intensive care and twenty-five times more likelihood of Apgar in the 5 th minute < 7. No association was observed between the groups and fetal presentation, mother's age, history of miscarriage, years of schooling of mother or attendance at prenatal sessions. After multivariate analysis, the only risk factors that remained significant were complications relating to the placenta or the umbilical cord. Deliveries involving complications relating to the placenta or the umbilical cord were {{three times more likely to}} involve fetal acidemia. CONCLUSIONS: acidemia among neonates was associated with a higher percentage of caesarians, premature births, a need for intensive care and treatment and an Apgar index of < 7 in the 5 th minute. After multivariate analysis, complications relating to premature displacement of the placenta and the umbilical cord were the only remaining risk factors associated with fetal acidemia...|$|R

In a randomized double-blind clinical trial, 200 wemen undergoing vaginal delivery without any risk factor for postpartum hemorrhage recruited. 100 assigned to receive 10 international units (IU) oxytocin diluted in 9 cc ringer by IUV injection and 10 cc ringer by peripheral vein injection and 100 assigned to receive 10 cc ringer by IUV injection and 10 international units (IU) oxytocin diluted in 9 cc ringer by peripheral vein injection. Active management of labor (prophylactic injection of 20 IU oxytocin after clamping of <b>umbilical</b> cord and <b>controlled</b> cord traction) was used in both groups. Pre delivery and post delivery hemoglobin level was assessed. The primary outcome was change in hemoglobin levels and duration of the third stage of labor. The third stage of labor was significantly shorter in IUV injection group (4. 2 ± 4. 1 minutes compared with 5. 5 ± 4. 5 minutes, respectively; p= 0. 03). An additional uterotonic agent in case group was needed less than the controlled group (P= 0. 03).

The management of heavy <b>umbilicals</b> connecting the <b>control</b> systems with the remote tools is therefore a key issue. Multiplexing signals can relieve the cable-handling difficulties. In this respect, the intrinsic wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) capabilities of fiber-optic technology make it a very promising candidate for integration in ITER instrumentation links. However, the radiation hardness of a complete WDM optical link still needs to be assessed. In this paper, as a first step toward the development of a rad-hard WDM optical link, we report on irradiations of different parts of a typical WDM optical link. We present our irradiation results on COTS fiber-optic devices, including WDM single-mode couplers, which remain operational up to MGy dose levels while the channel drift observed in narrow-band couplers compromises their use in WDM multiplexers. The intrinsic wavelength encoding of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors makes them ideal candidates for WDM fiber-optic sensor networks. Therefore, we also investigated the γ-radiation response of FBGs written in germanosilicate fibers. We irradiated such sensors up to MGy dose levels. At a total dose of 0. 1 MGy, saturation of the radiation-induced Bragg peak shift has been observed, evidencing the potential radiation hardness of FBG-based devices in highly radioactive environments. To illustrate wavelength multiplexing in sensing, we discuss our preliminary results on a new multicomponent force sensor design based on eight multiplexed FBG sensors intended for use at the end effector wrist of remote-controlled robots. Finally, we present the in-reactor irradiation results of standard Corning Ge-doped fiber up to GGy dose levels. © 2001, IEEE. All rights reserved. SCOPUS: no. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The world's first extravehicular {{activity}} (EVA) {{was performed by}} A. A. Leonov on March 18, 1965 during the Russian Voskhod- 2 mission. The first US EVA was executed by Gemini IV astronaut Ed White on June 3, 1965, with an umbilical tether that included communications and an oxygen supply. A hand-held maneuvering unit (HHMU) also {{was used to test}} maneuverability during the brief EVA; however the somewhat stiff <b>umbilical</b> limited <b>controlled</b> movement. That constraint, plus difficulty returning through the vehicle hatch, highlighted the need for increased thermal control and improved EVA ergonomics. Clearly, requirements for a useful EVA were interrelated with the vehicle design. The early Gemini EVAs generated requirements for suits providing micro-meteor protection, adequate visual field and eye protection from solar visual and infrared radiation, gloves optimized for dexterity while pressurized, and thermal systems capable of protecting the astronaut while rejecting metabolic heat during high workloads. Subsequent Gemini EVAs built upon this early experience and included development of a portable environmental control and life support systems (ECLSS) and an astronaut maneuvering unit. The ECLSS provided a pressure vessel and controller with functional control over suit pressure, oxygen flow, carbon dioxide removal, humidity, and temperature control. Gemini EVA experience also identified the usefulness of underwater neutral buoyancy and altitude chamber task training, and the importance of developing reliable task timelines. Improved thermal management and carbon dioxide control also were required for high workload tasks. With the Apollo project, EVA activity was primarily on the lunar surface; and suit durability, integrated liquid cooling garments, and low suit operating pressures (3. 75 pounds per square inch absolute [psia] or 25. 8 kilopascal [kPa],) were required to facilitate longer EVAs with ambulation and significant physical workloads with average metabolic rates of 1000 BTU/hr and peaks of up to 2200 BTU/hr. Mobility was further augmented with the Lunar Roving Vehicle. The Apollo extravehicular mobility unit (EMU) was made up of over 15 components, ranging from a biomedical belt for capturing and transmitting biomedical data, urine and fecal containment systems, a liquid cooling garment, communications cap, a modular portable life support system (PLSS), a boot system, thermal overgloves, and a bubble helmet with eye protection. Apollo lunar astronauts performed successful EVAs on the lunar surface from a 5 psia (34. 4 kPa) 100 % oxygen environment in the Lunar Lander. A maximum of three EVAs were performed on any mission. For Skylab a modified A 7 LB suit, used for Apollo 15, was selected. The Skylab astronaut life support assembly (ALSA) provided umbilical support through the life support umbilical (LSU) and used open loop oxygen flow, rather than closed-loop as in Apollo missions. Thermal control was provided by liquid water circulated by spacecraft pumps and electrical power also was provided from the spacecraft via the umbilical. The cabin atmosphere of 5 psia (34. 4 kPa), 70 % oxygen, provided a normoxic atmosphere and because of the very low nitrogen partial pressures, no special protocols were required to protect against decompression sickness (DCS) {{as was the case with}} the Apollo spacecraft with a 5 psi, 100 % oxygen environment...|$|R
40|$|Blowout preventers are {{designed}} to shut in a well under pressure so that formation fluids that have moved into the wellbore can be contained and circulated out while continuous control of the well is maintained. Control Systems for the BOPs are of necessity highly efficient hydraulic systems. The objective is to operate functions, such as closing rams, on the BOP stack in as short a time as possible. Supplying enough volume of pressured hydraulic fluid to operate those emergency functions is essential. To have the necessary quantity of control fluid under pressure requires storing this fluid in accumulators. These accumulators operate by the expansion and compression of nitrogen gas that is separated from hydraulic fluid by either rubber bladders or pistons. Accumulators are used both {{on the surface and}} at the seafloor. As long as you use accumulators on the surface or in relatively shallow waters, you may not {{have a problem with the}} volume of hydraulic fluid capacity of gas charged accumulators. The problem may arise when the wellhead is at water depth of more than 3500 ft. In deep water drilling, the accumulators should be placed on the subsea blowout preventer stack to reduce hydraulic response times and provide a hydraulic power supply in case of interruption of surface communication. Accumulators are also used in subsea production control systems to provide local storage that allows smaller line sizes in <b>control</b> <b>umbilicals.</b> Hydraulic fluid capacity of an accumulator drops to 15 % of its capacity on the surface and even less, depending on the water depth. A large number of accumulators are needed to perform BOP functions that could have been done by just a few of them on the surface or at relatively shallow water depth. Gas inside gas charged accumulators does not behave like an ideal gas as we go to very deep water, due to high hydrostatic pressure at that water depth. The higher the ambient pressure, the more the gas behaves like a real gas rather than an ideal gas and the lower the fluid capacity of the accumulators. Compressed gas has energy in it, and can release this energy at the time desired, that??s why it is used in accumulators. Now, we have to look for something that is able to store energy, but unlike the nitrogen, its functionality must not be affected by the increasing hydrostatic pressure of water as a function of water depth. Springs and heavy weights will be discussed as two options to replace nitrogen in accumulators. Efficient deep water accumulators would reduce the number of accumulators required in deepwater and cut the cost of the project. With the advent of such efficient accumulators, we can hope that one of the numerous problems of deepwater drilling has been solved and we can think of drilling in even deeper waters...|$|R
