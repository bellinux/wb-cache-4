50|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} a priest whose hands were {{deformed}} should not lift <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> {{to say the}} priestly blessing, and Rabbi Judah said that a priest whose hands were discolored should not lift <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> because it would cause the congregation {{to look at him}} during this blessing when they should not. A Baraita stated that deformities on the face, hands, or feet were disqualifying for saying the priestly blessing. Rabbi Joshua ben Levi said that a Kohen with spotted hands should not say the blessing. A Baraita taught that one whose hands were curved inwards or bent sideways should not say the blessing. And Rav Huna said that a man whose eyes ran should not say the blessing. But the Gemara noted that such a Kohen in Rav Huna's neighborhood used to say the priestly blessing and apparently even Rav Huna did not object, because the townspeople had become accustomed to the Kohen. And the Gemara cited a Baraita that taught that a man whose eyes ran should not lift <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> but he was permitted to do so if the townspeople were accustomed to him. Rabbi Johanan said that a man blind in one eye should not lift <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b> But the Gemara noted that there was one in Rabbi Johanan's neighborhood who used to lift <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> as the townspeople were accustomed to him. And the Gemara cited a Baraita that taught that a man blind in one eye should not lift <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> but if the townspeople were accustomed to him, he was permitted. Rabbi Judah said that a man whose hands were discolored should not lift <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> but the Gemara cited a Baraita that taught that if most of the men of the town follow the same hand-discoloring occupation, it was permitted.|$|R

2500|$|The Talmud {{states that}} Pharaoh's {{daughter}} {{played a role}} in why Jeroboam was found worthy of becoming ruler of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. At Sanhedrin 101b it says [...] "Why did Jeroboam merit sovereignty? Because he reproved Solomon. And why was he punished? Because he reproved him publicly. As it is written, And this was the cause that he lifted <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father. He said thus to him: Thy father David made breaches in the wall, that Israel might come up [...] on the Festivals; whilst thou hast closed them, in order to exact toll for the benefit of Pharaoh's daughter. What is meant by And this was the cause that he lifted <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> against the king? [...] — R. Nahman said: He took off his phylacteries in front of him." ...|$|E

"And Jeroboam {{the son of}} Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, {{a servant}} of Solomon, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> against the king. And this was the cause that he lifted <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> against the king: Solomon built Millo, and {{repaired}} the breach {{of the city of}} David his father. And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge over all the labour of the house of Joseph. And it came to pass at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field. And Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces. And he said to Jeroboam: 'Take thee ten pieces; for thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee—but he shall have one tribe, for My servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel—because that they have forsaken Me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon; and they have not walked in My ways, to do that which is right in Mine eyes, and to keep My statutes and Mine ordinances, as did David his father." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cornell’s first {{heat was}} versus the Leander Club crew of London, England, coached by Rudolph C. Lehmann. The {{members of the}} Leander Club were {{composed}} almost entirely of former Oxford and Cambridge oarsman. They had won the Cup seven times and were the four-time defending champion. Leander was considered the best crew in England, and was the favorite to win the Cup in 1895. The race was a contrast of rowing styles. Cornell rowed the Courtney stroke, which was short and choppy compared to the Leander’s long and sweeping stroke. The heat was marred by controversy right from the start. Cornell and Leander crew took up their positions at the starting point. When the umpire asked if the crews were ready, F. D. Colson, the Cornell coxswain, answered [...] "yes". The Leander crew insisted two members shouted [...] "No" [...] and C. W. Kent, the crew’s stroke, held <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> [...] The umpire insisted that someone from the English crew answered that they were ready and then gave the command to start the race. Both crews shot out from the starting line. Cornell rowed with strong even strokes, but {{only half of the}} Leander club was rowing. At that point, Leander stopped rowing, and C. F. Beggs and C. W. Kent, the Leander coxswain and stroke respectively, protested to the umpire. When the umpire did not tell Cornell to stop or return to the start, Cornell continued rowing at a leisurely pace, followed by the referee’s boat. Cornell finished the course of one mile (1.6km) and [...] in 8 minutes and 11 seconds. This was more than a minute over the time they were rowing in practice. When they crossed the finish line, they were declared the winner of the heat by the umpire. The Leander crew protested the Cornell victory, stating that they notified the umpire before he gave the notice to start the race. They appealed it to the [...] "steward", who met {{at the end of the}} day but they ruled in favor of Cornell victory. They adopted the following resolution: [...] "Resolved, That the committee, while deeply regretting the most unfortunate misunderstand, feel that they must abide by the laws of boat racing and cannot review the decision of the umpire or starter." ...|$|E
