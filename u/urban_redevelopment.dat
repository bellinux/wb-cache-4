5|$|The Lines International {{conditions}} were applied {{by a different}} High Court judge {{in the case of}} Borissik Svetlana v. <b>Urban</b> <b>Redevelopment</b> Authority (2009). The plaintiff argued that the <b>Urban</b> <b>Redevelopment</b> Authority ("URA") had not been transparent while processing her application for permission to redevelop her house, or had not given her case genuine consideration. The Court held that the URA had considered the planning approval application, and had explained to the plaintiff the implications of her proposal and had extended several invitations to discuss the proposal but the plaintiff had declined to amend her redevelopment plans. On these facts, the Court held that the URA had thoroughly considered the plaintiff's application and had not fettered its discretion.|$|E

At the time the museum lacked premises, and Merrifield assisted its keeper, Norman Cook, in establishing an exhibit at the Royal Exchange in 1954. During these post-war years the city's archaeological community was largely preoccupied with salvaging Roman and medieval structures damaged in the Blitz, and by subsequent <b>urban</b> <b>redevelopment.</b>|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, a {{proposal}} to establish a station at Valby, where the Carlsberg Group is planning an <b>urban</b> <b>redevelopment,</b> was scrapped. The proposal would have increased construction costs by DKK900million and was deemed not economical. The increased cost was, in part, due to an extra TBM being needed to complete the project on time. The City Circle Line was passed by parliament on 1 June 2007, with only the Red–Green Alliance voting in disfavor.|$|E

5|$|The Nydalen district, {{formerly}} {{an industrial}} area, has since undergone <b>urban</b> <b>redevelopment.</b> The immediate {{vicinity of the}} station includes several large workplaces. In 2005, BI, with 8000 students and faculty, {{moved into a new}} campus across the street from Nydalen Station. Nydalen is the only underground station on the Ring Line. The escalators leading down to the platform features The Tunnel of Light, an artistic presentation of sound and colour around the passengers as they ascend from or to descend to the station. The artwork contains 1800 lights and 44 speakers. Nydalen also serves as a bus hub.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} <b>urban</b> waterfront <b>redevelopment</b> in Greek cities, regarding {{them as a}} {{group of}} cities rather than focusing on each case independently. It attempts to set up a theoretical framework for the redesign of space based on three considerations: (a) the development prospects of Greek cities, and especially smaller Greek cities, within the European urban system, (b) the potential of urban design as a means of economic development of cities and the ways such a ‘use’ of urban design may be adopted by Greek cities in <b>urban</b> waterfront <b>redevelopment</b> and (c) the main morphological and spatial characteristics exhibited in common by Greek cities and their waterfronts. The paper argues that in the competitive European urban system, <b>urban</b> waterfront <b>redevelopment</b> is a challenge for Greek cities – a pilot spatial terrain where ‘change’, ‘improvement’ and ‘development’ may operate: (i) ‘change’ of the established urban design practices from episodic and soft interventions towards large scaled interventions and avant-garde design of space, (ii) ‘improvement’ of the quality of space in the core of Greek cities, and (iii) ‘development’ of urban tourism by placing Greek cities on the urban map of Europe as a distinct group of cities with characteristic waterfront...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWhen we {{talk about}} urban sustainability, also {{mobility}} and transportation systems acquire a leading part to guarantee high levels of efficiency and livability of urban and metropolitan systems. Nowadays, railway transport networks represent essential frames to assure accessibility and reduction of traffic pollution and congestion, {{as well as they}} provide opportunities for urban regeneration. Recently, in Europe, railway stations have assumed a strategic role in <b>urban</b> <b>redevelopments</b> to provide efficient and livable urban and metropolitan systems but it's also necessary to have effective tools to achieve transport and urban goals at the same time. This paper illustrates an analytical and evaluation method to assess the renewal redevelopment potential of great rail stations and the spatial and urban regeneration opportunities that follow. The methodology has been implemented by its application to two Italian rail station redevelopments...|$|R

5|$|A {{statutory}} {{board is}} an autonomous {{agency of the}} Government that is established by an Act of Parliament and overseen by a government ministry. The Act sets out the purposes, powers and rights of the agency. Unlike ministries and government departments that are subdivisions of ministries, statutory boards may not be staffed by civil servants and have greater independence and flexibility in their operations. They are managed by boards of directors whose members usually include businessmen, professionals, senior civil servants and officials of trade unions. The Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), the Central Provident Fund Board (CPF), the Housing and Development Board (HDB), the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS), the Land Transport Authority (LTA), the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the National Heritage Board (NHB), and the <b>Urban</b> <b>Redevelopment</b> Authority (URA) are all statutory boards.|$|E
5|$|In Borissik Svetlana v. <b>Urban</b> <b>Redevelopment</b> Authority (2009), the {{applicant}} {{and her husband}} owned a semi-detached house which they wished to redevelop. In 2002, the <b>Urban</b> <b>Redevelopment</b> Authority (URA) had issued a circular imposing certain restrictions on the redevelopment of semi-detached houses. The URA rejected {{the applicant}}'s redevelopment application {{on the basis of}} the circular. Counsel for the applicant argued before the High Court that the applicant had a legitimate expectation that the proposal to redevelop the house would be approved. The Court held that the URA had not acted in a way that could have led the applicant to have such a legitimate expectation. It adopted four conditions set out in De Smith's Judicial Review (6th ed., 2007) to determine whether a legitimate expectation has been created: the public body's representation must be clear, unambiguous and devoid of any relevant qualification; induced by the conduct of the decision-maker; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority; and applicable to the applicant, who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation is reasonably expected to apply. The only legitimate expectation that could have arisen after the 2002 circular had been issued was that the URA would act in accordance with those guidelines unless the circumstances were such that an exception has to be made. The applicant in Borissik argued that she had a legitimate expectation to a substantive right, but since the Court decided that the URA had made no clear representation to her, it did not make any pronouncements on the approach that should be taken towards substantive legitimate expectations in Singapore.|$|E

It then {{underwent}} restoration between 2006 and March 2008 by CPG Consultants under the supervision of architect Maureen Soh. As the original hand-crafted timber arches and railings on the first-storey verandah had been damaged by termites, replacements moulded from the originals made with an aluminium-cast alloy were used. Details on railings, doors and windows were restored, and several pintu pagar (traditional wooden half-doors) and wooden flooring reinstated. The former servants' quarters at the rear of the building were turned into a heritage gallery.

A similar redevelopment project at Fornebu in Bærum involves plans for building the Fornebu Line as an extension of the Lilleaker Line from Furulund via Lysaker Station to Fornebu. The line was previously planned as a people mover, but the solution was unsuccessful, and planning now focuses on building a tramway instead. An extension of the Sinsen Line to Tonsenhagen is planned.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{sought help}} from the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic (GDR), and P. R. China for funding for several projects and military advice. The failure of several GDR-led projects including the New Zanzibar Project, a 1968 <b>urban</b> <b>redevelopment</b> scheme to provide new apartments for all Zanzibaris, led to Zanzibar focussing on Chinese aid. The post-revolution Zanzibar government was accused of draconian controls on personal freedoms and travel and exercised nepotism in appointments to political and industrial offices, the new Tanzanian government being powerless to intervene. Dissatisfaction with the government {{came to a head}} with the assassination of Karume on 7 April 1972, which was followed by weeks of fighting between pro and anti-government forces. A multi-party system was eventually established in 1992, but Zanzibar remains dogged by allegations of corruption and vote-rigging, though the 2010 general election was seen to be a considerable improvement.|$|E
5|$|Originally, a {{redevelopment}} of Nadderud was proposed, but in 1999 Stabæk players {{launched the}} idea of building a new stadium at Fornebu, which became subject to an <b>urban</b> <b>redevelopment</b> project after the 1998 closing of Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The initial proposal was named Blue Dream Arena, would have seating for 25,000 spectators, blue artificial turf and a retractable roof. Other proposed amenities were movable seating which would also allow the stadium to both host athletics and be configured as an intimate football stadium. The idea called for Bruce Springsteen to hold a concert before the first match, which would be played against Barcelona. Several of the initial concepts of the stadium were never materialized. International rules disallowed blue artificial turf; instead, the flooring in the boxes were made in a blue, artificial turf-inspired material. Also {{the idea of}} having a retractable roof was discarded, both because of technical difficulties and cost issues.|$|E

40|$|AbstractUrban land {{redevelopment}} {{which is}} a reconstruction on a previously developed area with existing transportation facilities {{is an important component}} of city evolution. While improving land use efficiency, it can bring negative impact to transportation system, such as causing traffic congestion. Especially in China, there are many examples about redevelopment projects causing traffic congestion. For a better guidance of land redevelopment of China, it is necessary to find the reason caused traffic congestion after <b>urban</b> land <b>redevelopment</b> and provide some corresponding countermeasures. The objective of this study is not only to attract attention to the transportation during <b>urban</b> land <b>redevelopment</b> planning and management, but also to provide a way to reduce traffic congestion. In this paper, we first analyzed why traffic congestion happened after <b>urban</b> land <b>redevelopment</b> through some classical examples. We didn’t stop at the apparent reason, but do deep analysis. As a result, we uncovered the traffic congestion after redevelopment is due to inappropriate land use and transportation facilities under redevelopment, but the real cause is originated from urban and transportation planning and management. Consequently, we offered some corresponding countermeasures from three aspects: (1) before development, ingrate urban land and transportation and do a rational planning to avoid inappropriate redevelopment planning; (2) during development, improve and strengthen management and control to ensure that the redevelopment project are proper; (3) after redevelopment, implement traffic congestion management of both traffic supply and demand to relief traffic congestion...|$|R
