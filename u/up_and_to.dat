According to some historians, the agitation against the Assyrians was also encouraged by Rashid Ali al-Gaylani's Arab nationalist government, which {{saw it as a}} distraction to the continuous Shiite revolt {{in the southern part of}} the country.|$|E
5|$|The first {{ionization}} energy is the energy {{it takes to}} remove one electron from an atom, the second {{ionization energy}} is the energy it takes to remove a second electron from the atom, and so on. For a given atom, successive ionization energies increase with the degree of ionization. For magnesium as an example, the first ionization energy is 738kJ/mol {{and the second is}} 1450kJ/mol. Electrons in the closer orbitals experience greater forces of electrostatic attraction; thus, their removal requires increasingly more energy. Ionization energy becomes greater <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> the right of the periodic table.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} contour {{integration}} comprises {{a major part}} of complex analysis. In this context the direction of travel around a closed curve is important– reversing the direction in which the curve is traversed multiplies the value of the integral by 1. By convention the positive direction is counterclockwise. For example, the unit circle is traversed in the positive direction when we start at the point z = 1, then travel <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> the left through the point z = i, then down and to the left through 1, then down and to the right through i, and finally <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> the right to z = 1, where we started.|$|E

25|$|Act Two {{begins with}} fitness queen, Brooke Wyndham, and her fitness team's workout video, {{which is being}} viewed by Elle, Callahan, Emmett, Vivienne, Warner, and Enid ("Whipped Into Shape"). Callahan tells the legal team that Brooke is accused of murdering her billionaire husband. At the jail, the legal team are unable to get Brooke to tell them her alibi and refuses to plead guilty. Upon {{learning}} that they were both Delta Nu sisters, Brooke then privately tells Elle her alibi that she was getting liposuction, but makes Elle promise not to tell anyone ("Delta Nu Nu Nu"). Because of Elle's loyalty to her client and refusal to state the alibi, Elle and Emmett are shunned by the group. To cheer Emmett <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> increase his chances of impressing Callahan, Elle gives him a makeover ("Take It Like A Man").|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{provisions}} of the Defence Act 1903 which precluded sending conscripts overseas to fight, following the outbreak of World War I it was decided to raise an all volunteer force, outside of the already existing militia organisation, known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). Many members of the militia joined <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> a large extent, where possible, the AIF battalions were formed on a territorial basis, which meant that many of the AIF units were able to maintain the identity of their associated militia units. The 3rd Battalion, AIF, was raised soon after the declaration of war, and began concentrating at Randwick, drawing its recruits from the Werriwa area of New South Wales. The militia unit that was operating in the area at that time was the 43rd (Werriwa) Infantry Regiment, a regiment that could trace its lineage back to 1869.|$|E

During Young's first season as manager, Glentoran's financial difficulties escalated, until HMRC issued Glentoran a winding up order, and gave the club {{until the beginning of}} January 2011 to clear all outstanding debts which totalled over £300,000. A fund raising organisation, Spirit of '41(which was named after the year when The Oval was bombed by Germans and the massive effort to rebuild it) was set <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> this day has raised over £25,000. On 12 January 2011, a special EGM was held which set out the proposals that would save Glentoran from oblivion and change radically how the club is run. The vote was passed unanimously with the condition that 3 new board members were added, including a new chairman, and the current chairman stepped down to vice chairman.|$|E

25|$|Homer {{relates the}} events of Polypites birth and the attack of the centaurs, when the ritual {{procession}} to gift a girdle in the sanctuary of Artemis is interrupted. While nearing the sanctuary, the procession is set upon by a gang of centaurs, precipitating a brawl, much as had happened at the wedding feast. The first slab of the Centauromachy, BM 526, focuses {{on a pair of}} Greeks clad in mantles and fighting barehanded. Although they face in opposite directions, their poses are nearly identical, differing only in that one, BM 526:2, folds his lower left leg under the thigh as he kneels {{on the back of his}} adversary. On the next slab, BM 524, the goal of the procession, the ritual sanctuary of Artemis, is indicated by a tree hung with a lion or panther skin in thanksgiving for a successful hunt. The Greek (BM 524:1) who defends the two women against the centaur has no attributes save for the weapon that was held in his right hand. The roughly cut form that extends from the bottom of the fist seems to be the stump of a club. Into the top of the fist is fitted a metal club, requiring a stronger anchor than did the bronze swords attached to fists elsewhere. The hole for the club is therefore twice as wide and deep as those used for swords. This club identifies the hero as Theseus. The two victims of the centaur flank a small statue of Artemis. The axis of the statue is slightly off vertical, for it is not fixed to a base but carried by the priestess, BM 524:3. No base is actually seen, and the poses of the two women preclude there being one behind them. The left leg of the woman who gestures with extended arms, BM 524:4, reaches backward below the statue, where the base would be. The woman who holds the statue, BM 524:3, wraps her peplos around part of its back. As the centaur pulls the garment off her proper left shoulder, it passes behind her neck but does not appear between her nude torso and the statue. It reappears in the priestess’s left hand, being drawn from the left, <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> the right. As a result, it must be understood as partially encompassing the lower parts of the statue.|$|E

Though the book primarily consists of a loose narrative monologue by Lois, it is also interspersed with sections from other characters such as Peter Griffin.

500|$|Francesco Algarotti's Essay on the Opera (1755) {{was a major}} {{influence}} {{in the development of}} Gluck's reformist ideology. Algarotti proposed a heavily simplified model of opera seria, with the drama pre-eminent, instead of the music or ballet or staging. The drama itself should [...] "delight the eyes and ears, to rouse <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> affect the hearts of an audience, without the risk of sinning against reason or common sense". Algarotti's ideas influenced both Gluck and his librettist, Calzabigi. Calzabigi was himself a prominent advocate of reform, and he stated: [...] "If Mr Gluck was the creator of dramatic music, he did not create it from nothing. I provided him with the material or the chaos, if you like. We therefore share the honour of that creation." ...|$|E

[...] As a result, some elements of the expedition spent two days lost in swamps before the majority finally reached the falls on the upper Chaudière on October 31. [...] Along the way, Captain Henry Dearborn's dog was eaten, an event recorded in his diary: [...] " [...] every part of him, not excepting his entrails; and after finishing their meal, they collected the bones and carried them to be pounded <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> make broth for another meal." ...|$|E

Andy still has a crush on April, who previously liked Andy until she learned Ann had kissed him.

A discouraged Andy seeks advice from Leslie, who encourages him not to give <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> [...] "go big or go home". Inspired by her own advice, Leslie proposes restoring the parks department with a Harvest Festival, which was once a Pawnee tradition until eliminated by budget cuts. Leslie and the other parks employees agree that if it is not a success, the parks department will shut down. Impressed by their enthusiasm, Chris and Ben agree to the idea.|$|E
