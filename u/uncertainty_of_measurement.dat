As such it is more usual to perform reciprocity calibration in an acoustical coupler, and then apply a correction if the microphone is to be used in free-field conditions; such corrections are standardised for laboratory standard microphones (IEC/TS 61094-7) and are generally available from the manufacturers of most of the common microphone types.|$|E

They must be calculated {{making use of}} algorithms basing on the results <b>of</b> direct <b>measurements.</b> Any measurement is always an inaccurate operation. A measure of the inaccuracy <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> is the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> this <b>measurement</b> defined as a parameter characterizing the scatter of values of the measured quantity. The paper deals with some selected problems connected with the determination <b>of</b> the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> and calculated values in compliance with DIN and ISO standard. The calculations <b>of</b> the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> the specific enthalpy, difference of enthalpy, the fluid flux and the energy efficiency of the steam boiler determination have been presented, as well as exemplary results of calculation <b>of</b> the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> the thermal efficiency of a steam boiler fired with pulverized coal.

40|$|When {{calibrating}} {{a machine}} tool, multiple measurement tasks will be performed, {{each of which}} has an associated <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> International Standards and best-practice guides are available to aid with estimating <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> for individual tasks, but there is little consideration for the temporal influence on the uncertainty when considering interrelated measurements. Additionally, there is an absence of any intelligent method capable of optimising (reducing) the estimated uncertainty of the calibration plan as a whole. In this work, the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> reduction problem is described and modelled in a suitable language to allow state-of-the-art artificial intelligence planning tools to produce optimal calibration plans. The paper describes how the continuous, non-linear temperature aspects are discretized and modelled to make them easier for the planner to solve. In addition, detail is provided as how the complex uncertainty equations are modelled in a restrictive language where its syntax heavily influences the encoding. An example is shown for a three-axis machine, where the produced plan exhibits intelligent behaviour in terms of scheduling measurements against temperature deviation and the propagation of error uncertainties. In this example, a reduction of 58 % in the estimated <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> due to intelligently scheduling a calibration plan is observed.

Any measurement has an error associated with it. The parameter that quantifies {{the boundaries of the}} error of that measurement is known as the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> Without determining the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement,</b> any measurement lacks merit. An assessment of <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> is carried out for the standard test method for penetration of bituminous materials as prescribed by ASTM D 5. The assessment of <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> is performed using the principles stated in the IS 0 Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (IS 0 GUM). A model was formulated for the purposes of determining the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement,</b> incorporating the equipment (based in the advanced testing laboratories at the CSIR), environment and test procedure. Sources of measurement variation were identified and isolated within the model. Furthermore, these sources were classified as either random or systematic, as well as whether they were subject to type A or type B analyses. Experimental processes quantified the various sources of uncertainty and an overall <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> was calculated for the test method. This paper illustrates how IS 0 GUM may be applied to determine the accuracy of the penetration test method. The results can be used to refine the penetration test procedure and tighten up on equipment specifications {{in order to reduce the}} level of test uncertainty. In addition, this paper may serve as an example of how to extend IS 0 GUM to other laboratory test methods. This paper was transferred from the original CD ROM created for this conference.

There are no {{intelligent}} tools aiding {{the production of}} optimal measurement plans. In previous work, a method of intelligently constructing measurement plans demonstrated that it is feasible to optimise the plans either to reduce machine tool downtime or the estimated <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> due to the plan schedule. However, production scheduling and a continuously changing environment can impose conflicting constraints on downtime and the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> In this paper, {{the use of the}} produced measurement model to minimise machine tool downtime, the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> and the arithmetic mean of both is investigated and discussed through the use of twelve different error mapping instances. The multi-objective search plans on average have a 3 % reduction in the time metric when compared to the downtime of the uncertainty optimised plan and a 23 % improvement in estimated <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> metric when compared to the uncertainty of the temporally optimised plan. Further experiments on a High Performance Computing (HPC) architecture demonstrated that there is on average a 3 % improvement in optimality when compared with the experiments performed on the PC architecture.
