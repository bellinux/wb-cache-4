50|$|Homunculus patagonicus is an {{extinct species}} of New World monkey {{that lived in}} Argentina (Santa Cruz Formation) during the Miocene. It is likely the ancestral species for the {{subfamily}} Pitheciinae, whose living members include the sakis, bearded sakis, and the <b>uakaris.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pithecids {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} monkeys, ranging from 23 cm in head-body length {{for the smaller}} titis, to 44-49 cm for the <b>uakaris.</b> They have medium to long fur, {{in a wide range}} of colors, often with contrasting patches, especially on the face.|$|E

50|$|Sakis are frugivores. Their diet {{consists}} of over 90% fruit and is supplemented {{by a small}} proportion of leaves, flowers, and insects. Sakis, as well as <b>uakaris,</b> engage in a specialized form of frugivory in which they focus specifically on unripe fruits and seeds.|$|E
50|$|The white-eared titi {{belongs to}} the New World monkey family Pitheciidae, which {{contains}} the titis (Callicebus), saki monkeys (Pithecia), bearded sakis (Chiropotes), and <b>uakaris</b> (Cacajao). It {{is a member of}} the subfamily Callicebinae, of which the only extant genus is Callicebus, containing all of the titi monkeys.|$|E
50|$|This monkey {{is named}} after Brazilian {{biologist}} José Márcio Ayres, formerly a senior zoologist for the Wildlife Conservation Society. José Márcio Ayres, who died in 2003, pioneered studies in <b>uakaris</b> and played {{a fundamental role in}} the creation of the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve, which is of great importance for the bald uakari.|$|E
50|$|The Pitheciidae {{are one of}} {{the five}} {{families}} of New World monkeys now recognised. Formerly, they were included in the family Atelidae. The family includes the titis, saki monkeys and <b>uakaris.</b> Most species are native to the Amazon region of Brazil, with some being found from Colombia in the north to Bolivia in the south.|$|E
50|$|These <b>uakaris</b> mainly feed on {{seeds and}} fruits, {{but will also}} eat leaves, pith and insects. They have large canines {{that allow them to}} feed on seeds from fruits with hard shells and incisors that are able to shatter the husk for access to the inner seeds. They are also known to consume fruits from many {{different}} species of trees. Overall, there is little competition with other primates for food, as most living in the same habitat do not devour hard fruits, however some competition with birds exist. Leaves are also consumed, especially when fruits are low during the dry season. Another dietary form observed is insectivory, peaking when fruit availability is low, through the consumption of fruit infested with insects or through the deliberate hunting of insects for protein. <b>Uakaris</b> have been seen raiding wasp nests for larvae and even eating the eggs of river turtles.|$|E
50|$|Females {{give birth}} to a single young after a {{gestation}} period of between four and six months, depending on species. The <b>uakaris</b> and bearded sakis are polygamous, living in groups of 8-30 individuals. Each group has multiple males, which establish a dominance hierarchy amongst themselves. The titis and Pithecia sakis, by contrast, are monogamous and live in much smaller family groups.|$|E
50|$|The <b>uakaris</b> are unusual among New World monkeys in {{that the}} tail length (15-18 cm) is {{substantially}} less than their head and body length (40-45 cm). Their bodies are covered with long, loose hair but their heads are bald. They have almost no subcutaneous fat, so their bald faces appear almost skull like. Like their closest relatives the saki monkeys, they have projecting lower incisors.|$|E
5000|$|They are diurnal and {{arboreal}} animals, {{found in}} tropical forests from low-lying swamp to mountain slopes. They are predominantly herbivorous, eating mostly fruit and seeds, although some species will also eat {{a small number}} of insects. Sakis and <b>uakaris</b> have a diastema between the canine and premolar teeth, but the titis, which have unusually small canines for New World monkeys, do not. All species have the dental formula: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Uakaris</b> are {{typically}} lethargic and silent in zoo conditions, {{but in the}} wild they are agile and active, capable of leaps of over 6 meters. They have been observed both in small groups and in larger troops of up to 100. When traveling through the forest they move in the lower branches of the trees, though when foraging they also {{go up to the}} canopy. They eat fruit, nuts, buds and leaves.|$|E
50|$|Very {{little is}} known about the Aracá uakari, but based on present {{knowledge}} it has the smallest distribution of all species of <b>uakaris</b> (possibly as small as 5000 - 6000 km2) and is the only one not found in any protected area. Although few people live within its very remote distribution, it is hunted; at least seasonally. It has been suggested it should be considered endangered, but it is currently listed as vulnerable by the IUCN.|$|E
50|$|The ornate titi (Callicebus ornatus) is {{a species}} of titi {{belonging}} to the p. moloch group, and is the smallest member of the Pitheciidae family, which also includes <b>uakaris</b> and saki monkeys. As it {{is a member of}} this family, it is classified as a type of New World monkey. It is endemic to eastern Colombia, and {{the only member of the}} p. moloch group to occur north of the Rios Amazonas/Solimes/Napo axis, living at least 350 km away from the closest other member, the white tailed-titi (Callicebus discolor), which lives in the south of Colombia. It was once classified as the same species as the white-tailed titi, but is now officially recognized as its own species. The ornate titi is also terrestrial.|$|E
50|$|Forest {{loss and}} hunting {{are the two}} most {{prominent}} threats to the bald uakari. Between 1980 and 1990 it was found that an average of 15.4 million hectares of tropical forests were destroyed each year and the Neotropics are facing forest loss in areas such as the southern and eastern parts of the Amazonia. In 1997, the Amazon Basin experienced the highest rate of forest destruction of the remaining tropical rainforests worldwide. Logging of hardwoods is a major contributor to overall destruction as large-scale logging disrupts the continuity of forest canopies. Canopy disruption and forest loss directly affect <b>uakaris</b> because of their arboreal lifestyle and adaptations for seed food consumption. Additionally, Cacajao calvus populations are located so close to the Amazon River that there is a higher risk of human hunting from canoes and such to use the primates as a food source or bait.|$|E
40|$|The {{author of}} the last {{published}} systematic review of Cacajao recognized 2 subspecies of black-headed <b>uakaris</b> (black <b>uakaris)</b> : Cacajao melanocephalus melanocephalus and C. m. ouakary. As {{a result of a}} series of black uakari surveys and collecting expeditions to several tributaries of the Rio Negro and of morphological and molecular analyses of museum specimens and specimens we collected during field expeditions, we reassess their taxonomy. We describe a newly discovered species of black uakari from the Rio Aracá, a left bank tributary of the Rio Negro, Amazonas, Brazil. We also show that ouakary is a junior synonym of melanocephalus and provide a new name and a new description for Cacajao melanocephalus melanocephalus in the Pico da Neblina region of Brazil and Venezuela. Based on genetic, morphological, and ecological evidence, we propose that there are 3 species of black <b>uakaris.</b> We named the Rio Aracá species Cacajao ayresi sp. nov. (Ayres uakari) in honor of the late José Márcio Ayres, a pioneer in uakari research and conservation. We named the Neblina black uakari Cacajao hosomi, after the Yanomami word for <b>uakaris.</b> The new taxonomic arrangement provided here implies that the conservation status of black <b>uakaris</b> needs to be reassessed...|$|E
40|$|Parallels of Zipf's law of brevity, the {{tendency}} of more frequent words to be shorter, {{have been found in}} bottlenose dolphins and Formosan macaques. Although these findings suggest that behavioral repertoires are shaped by a general principle of compression, common marmosets and golden-backed <b>uakaris</b> do not exhibit the law. However, we argue that the law may be impossible or difficult to detect statistically in a given species if the repertoire is too small, a problem that could be affecting golden backed <b>uakaris,</b> and show that the law is present in a subset of the repertoire of common marmosets. We suggest that the visibility of the law will depend on the subset of the repertoire under consideration or the repertoire size. Comment: Little improvements in the statistical argument...|$|E
40|$|White-faced sakis (Pithecia pithecia) {{are well}} known for their {{specialized}} feeding strategy and dependence on seed-eating, but we know less about so-cial dynamics and reproduction. I summarize data from 1990 to 2001 on sakis inhabiting a small island in Lago Guri, Venezuela that includes changes in group composition, aggressive behavior, and female reproductive histories. Though the characteristic group size and typical mating system are still un-certain for wild, free-ranging Pithecia spp., size of the study group ranged from 2 – 3 adult females and 1 – 4 adult males. My group and I collected fecal samples from adult females, which we dried and assayed for estrogen (E 1 C) and progesterone (PdG) conjugates to document reproductive cycles and fe-male development. During the study, as many as 3 females were either cycling or pregnant at the same time. Ten infants were born during the study, 4 of which survived to adulthood. Five interbirth intervals after weaning an infant ranged from 12 to 36 mo. Though researchers often assume Pithecia spp. are monogamous, multiple breeding females can coexist in groups without evi-dence of reproductive suppression. Within the pitheciine clade, Pithecia spp. exhibit a mosaic of behavioral and morphological traits intermediate between bearded sakis and <b>uakaris</b> {{on the one hand}} and their sister-group, the pair-bonded titis, on the other.

40|$|Even {{primates}} considered dietary specialists tend to eat {{a combination}} of fruit pulp, seeds, other plant parts, or animals. Specialist seed predators could either feed on seeds preferentially, or to avoid competition when ripe pulps are scarce. Pitheciin monkeys have specialized dentition {{that allows them to}} feed on seeds protected by hard shells, and the upper limit on the hardness of these {{is likely to be a}} function of jaw size. We recorded the diet of Peruvian red <b>uakaris</b> (Cacajao calvus ucayalii) on the Yavari River, Peru, to test the prediction that this seed predator would feed on the seeds of hard-shelled fruits preferentially over softer ones in relation to their availability in the forest. We also tested predictions that adult male, adult female, and juvenile diets would differ, with larger individuals eating more hard fruits. <b>Uakaris</b> ate 55. 4 % seeds, 38. 9 % pulps and arils, and 5. 6 % other items, but proportions varied through the year. More pulps, especially from the palm Mauritia flexuosa, were eaten when fruit availability was low, and more hard fruits were positively selected for than softer ones. Juveniles did not open the hardest fruit species opened by adults, and adult males ate harder fruits than females. These results provide evidence that seed eating in some primates has evolved beyond a means of avoiding competition for the ripe pulps typically preferred by many primates. Specialist seeding-eating primates therefore occupy divergent niches that require separate consideration from those of similar-sized primates...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{has been}} made {{available}} by the generous support of the estate of the late José Márcio Corrêa Ayres. Uakari monkeys from the Amazon River basin are the most specialized primates in the Neotropical region. Their short tails, peculiar dentition and external morphology are strikingly divergent from most other platyrrhines. Furthermore, their geographical range is small and restricted to the forests in the floodplains of Amazonian Rivers. It is the only frugivorous primate able to live within the young varzeas (white-water river floodplain) of the Amazon. A 20 -month study of {{the ecology of the}} white <b>uakaris</b> (Cacajao calvus calvus) was carried out in the floodplain located between the Japurá and Amazon Rivers in Brazilian Amazonia. The vegetation is unique in the way that it is able to cope with a 12 -metre annual change in water level. This annual variation in water level is probably the most important overall ecological mechanism in varzea, influencing the temporal and spatial patterns of distribution of fruits. Several aspects of the ecology and ranging behaviour of the <b>uakaris</b> are associated with the temporal and spatial patterns of distribution of potential food sources: the seeds of immature fruits. Subdividing fruits into separate morphological classes is of fundamental importance for understanding this variation, which is largely influenced by the changes in water level. Foods of high quality, high energetic value and low in secondary compounds, are extremely important at most times of the year due to the Uakari's gut structure, metabolic requirements, use of space and, especially the topography of their habitat. Comparisons are made with another pithecine of similar morphology and diet, but which lives in the dry terra firrne forests. Based on their present distribution and ecological preferences, an attempt is made to trace the evolutionary history of these two largest pithecines. Furthermore, the role of riverine habitats in the zoogeographic and speciation patterns of primates within Amazonia is discussed...|$|E
40|$|New World monkeys (NWM) {{represent}} a monophy-letic group of higher primates (infraorder Platyrrhini). The currently over 120 recognized species {{are assigned to}} at least 16 genera. Today these species are commonly clas-sified in 3 families, the Cebidae, Atelidae and Pitheciidae [Opazo et al., 2006; Wildman et al., 2009; Perelman et al., 2011; Matsui and Hasegawa, 2012 for recent review]. Owl monkeys (genus Aotus) are usually included in the fam-ily Cebidae, while Groves [2001] classified Aotus as a fourth family.

40|$|The Author(s) 2012.

40|$|Iron {{overload}} {{is common}} in lemurs and some New World nonhuman primates raised in captivity, {{but there is no}} such documentation in the red bald-headed uakari (Cacajao calvus rubicundus). This study describes postmortem documentation of severe iron storage disease in one red bald-headed uakari and the use of iron chelation with oral deferasirox in the three surviving members of the colony. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify pretreatment iron burden and to follow the response to therapy in two females, 22 and 28 yr of age, and one male 33 yr of age. Baseline liver iron concentrations ranged from 16 to 23 mg/g dry weight. In humans, a liver iron concentration greater than 15 mg/g is considered severe and associated with endocrine and cardiac toxicity. The <b>uakaris</b> were otherwise asymptomatic, generally healthy, nonpregnant, and on a stable, low-iron diet. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging indicated that dosage escalations up to 100 mg/kg were needed to produce meaningful reductions in iron stores. After 5 yr of therapy, two animals continue at a dosage of 100 mg/kg per day, and the third was transitioned to twice-weekly maintenance dosing because of successful de-ironing. The animals tolerated iron chelation therapy well, having stable hematologic, renal, and hepatic function profiles before, during, and after treatment. Deferasirox monotherapy may represent a therapeutic option in primates with iron storage disease when dietary measures are ineffective and phlebotomy is logistically challenging...|$|E
