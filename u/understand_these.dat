5|$|Conservation {{efforts for}} stipitate hydnoid fungi are {{hampered}} by {{a dearth of}} information about their basic ecology, and so molecular genetic techniques are increasingly employed in attempts to better <b>understand</b> <b>these</b> fungi. In the case of Phellodon tomentosus, for example, there is little correlation between fruitbody appearance and below-ground mycelium, {{making it hard to}} determine the distribution and rarity of the fungus with standard surveying techniques. Phellodon melaleucus and P.niger were included in a Scottish study to develop species-specific PCR primers {{that can be used to}} detect the mycelia of stipitate hydnoids in soil. DNA testing of collections labelled as P.melaleucus and P.niger from the United Kingdom revealed additional cryptic species. PCR analysis can be used to determine the presence of a Phellodon species up to four years after the appearance of fruitbodies, allowing a more accurate determination of their possible decline and threat of extinction.|$|E

5|$|The Han Chinese {{believed}} that three realms of Heaven, Earth, and Mankind were inextricably linked {{and subject to}} natural cycles; if man could <b>understand</b> <b>these</b> cycles, they could understand the hidden secrets of the three realms. One cycle was yin and yang, which corresponded to yielding and hard, shade and sunlight, feminine and masculine, and the Moon and Sun, respectively, while it was thought to govern the three realms and changing of seasons. The five phases was another important cycle where the elements of wood (mu 木), fire (huo 火), earth (tu 土), metal (jin 金), and water (shui 水) succeeded each other in rotation and each corresponded with certain traits of the three realms. For example, the five phases corresponded with other sets of five like the five organs (i.e. liver, heart, spleen, lungs and kidneys) and five tastes (i.e. sour, bitter, sweet, spicy, and salty), or even things like feelings, musical notes, colors, planets, calendars and time periods.|$|E
5|$|Theorists {{have worked}} to <b>understand</b> <b>these</b> {{response}} patterns by constructing mathematical models of neurons and neural networks, which can be simulated using computers. Some useful models are abstract, focusing on the conceptual structure of neural algorithms rather than {{the details of how}} they are implemented in the brain; other models attempt to incorporate data about the biophysical properties of real neurons. No model on any level is yet considered to be a fully valid description of brain function, though. The essential difficulty is that sophisticated computation by neural networks requires distributed processing in which hundreds or thousands of neurons work cooperatively—current methods of brain activity recording are only capable of isolating action potentials from a few dozen neurons at a time.|$|E

While most Texans <b>understand</b> <b>these</b> terms, there are no officially recognized boundaries and any two individuals are likely to describe the boundaries of these regions differently. Walter Prescott Webb, the American historian and geographer, suggested that the 98th meridian separates East and West Texas; Texas writer A.C.

25|$|Child-directed speech also {{catches the}} child's attention, and in {{situations}} where words for new objects are being expressed to the child, this form of speech may help the child recognize the speech cues and the new information provided. Data shows that children raised in highly verbal families had higher language scores than those children raised in low verbal families. Continuously hearing complicated sentences throughout language development increases the child's ability to <b>understand</b> <b>these</b> sentences and then to use complicated sentences as they develop. Studies have shown that students enrolled in high language classrooms have two times the growth in complex sentences usage than students in classrooms where teachers do not frequently use complex sentences.|$|E
25|$|Adherents of the Latter Day Saint {{movement}} give varied {{responses to}} these criticisms. Some point to what they claim is evidence {{for the presence of}} these items and locations. Others invoke the limited geography model, regarding the events of the Book of Mormon as taking place in such a geographically limited area that no evidence should be expected. Some counter that the words used in the Book of Mormon refer not to the animals, plants and technologies that presently exist but to other similar items that did exist at the time. These views are not directly supported by the LDS Church, but they do motivate archaeological efforts to further <b>understand</b> <b>these</b> situations, including research being performed by Brigham Young University (BYU) professors.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, {{interpretation}} of the microneurographic readings can be difficult because axonal membrane potential {{can not be determined}} from this method. A supplemental method used to better <b>understand</b> <b>these</b> readings involves examining recordings of post-spike excitability and shifts in latency; these features are associated with changes in membrane potential of unmyelinated axons like C fibers. Moalem-Taylor et al. experimentally used chemical modulators with known effects on membrane potential to study the post-spike super-excitability of C fibers. The researchers found three resulting events. Chemical medulators can produce a combination of loss of super-excitability along with increased axonal excitability, indicating membrane depolarization. Secondly, membrane hyperpolarization can result from a blockade of axonal hyperpolarization-activated current. Lastly, a non-specific increase in surface charge and a change in the voltage-dependent activation of sodium channels results from the application of calcium.|$|E

25|$|Each {{star system}} has {{a space station}} where the Traveller can trade resources, multitools, and ships, and {{interact}} {{with one or more}} aliens from three different races that populate the galaxy. The player may also find active or abandoned alien bases on planets that offer similar functions. Each alien race has their own language, presented as a word-for-word substitution which initially will be nonsense to the player. By frequent communications with that race, as well as finding monoliths scattered on planets that act as Rosetta stones, the player can better <b>understand</b> <b>these</b> languages and perform proper actions when interacting with the alien non-player characters, gaining favour from the alien and its race for future trading and combat. Consequentially, improper responses to aliens may cause them to dislike the Traveller, and their space-bound fleets may attack the Traveller on sight. The game includes a free market galactic store accessible at space stations or alien bases, where some resources and goods have higher values in some systems compared to others, enabling the player to profit on resource gathering and subsequent trade.|$|E
25|$|Although V. acadica {{workers are}} unable to mate, {{they are able to}} lay haploid eggs, which are destined to become males. This issue of male {{production}} often leads to conflict between workers and the queen. Because the effective paternity is >2, workers are more related to brothers (the queen’s sons) than to nephews (other workers’ sons) so the production of offspring by males are creating sons less related to the other workers than those produced by the queen. This leads to worker policing, an act carried out by workers to ensure there is little male production by workers. Various experiments of Vespula wasps have shown that absence of worker reproduction can most likely be attributed to worker policing. However, V. acadica {{is one of the few}} exceptions to the Vespula level generalization regarding worker policing. Worker ovary activation, worker laying, and overt queen-worker aggressions have been cited in members of the species as well as in other species within the Vespula rufa group. While these findings may indicate variation within Vespula species regarding conflict resolution and paternity, more research must be carried out in order to fully <b>understand</b> <b>these</b> implications.|$|E
