5|$|NASCAR, {{and stock}} car racing in general, {{has its roots}} in bootlegging during Prohibition. Junior Johnson was one of many bootleggers {{who took part in the}} sport during the 1950s, equally well known for his arrest in 1955 for {{operating}} his father's moonshine still as he is for his racing success. He ended <b>up</b> <b>spending</b> a year in an Ohio prison, but soon returned to the sport before retiring as a driver in 1966.|$|E
5|$|In Mumbai and Goa, Kaira (Alia Bhatt) is a {{promising}} cinematographer {{who wishes to}} direct her own films. Blunt and cynical, she is most comfortable when with her three best friends, Fatima (Ira Dubey), Jackie (Yashaswini Dayama) and Ganju (Gautmik). Kaira's life takes a downturn when Raghuvendra (Kunal Kapoor), a film producer for whom she breaks up with her childhood sweetheart, gets engaged to someone else. Her landlord turns {{her out of her}} apartment because the building association wants to rent apartments only to married couples. All this plus dissatisfaction with her prospects at work serves as a catalyst for her shift to Goa, where she now has to grudgingly live with her parents (Aban Deohans and Atul Kale) with whom she has some issues. She ends <b>up</b> <b>spending</b> many sleepless nights in unhappiness and uncertainty.|$|E

5|$|The group {{released}} several successful albums, including December's Children (And Everybody's), Aftermath and Between the Buttons, but {{in their}} personal lives their behaviour was brought into question. In 1967, Jagger and Richards were arrested on drug charges and were given unusually harsh sentences: Jagger was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for possession of four over-the-counter pep pills he had purchased in Italy. The traditionally conservative editor of The Times, William Rees-Mogg, wrote an article critical of the sentences; and on appeal Richards' sentence was overturned and Jagger's was amended to a conditional discharge (although he ended <b>up</b> <b>spending</b> one night inside London's Brixton Prison). The Rolling Stones continued to face legal battles for the next decade.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of the team in Canada was a major contributor; {{at the time the}} exchange rate was 67U.S. cents to the Canadian dollar. Because revenue was collected in Canadian dollars but player and coach salaries were paid in U.S. dollars, the team ended <b>up</b> <b>spending</b> an undue amount of its revenue on salaries. The 1998–99 lockout was the pivoting point for home game attendance. While the whole league experienced a drop in attendance after the lockout, Vancouver experienced an even larger fall. The average attendance in 1997–98 was 16,108, ranking 16th in the league, while it fell to 13,899 in 1999–00, ranking 27th.|$|E

It became the highest-grossing animated film in North America ($339.7 million), outside North America ($528.2 million), and worldwide ($867.9 million), in all three occasions out-grossing The Lion King. In North America, it was surpassed by both Shrek 2 in 2004 and Toy Story 3 in 2010. After the re-release of The Lion King in 2011, and then Despicable Me 2 and Frozen in 2013, Minions in 2015, Zootopia, its sequel Finding Dory in 2016, and Despicable Me 3 in 2017, passed it, it stands as the ninth highest-grossing animated film in these regions. Outside North America, it stands as the fifth highest-grossing animated film. Worldwide, it now ranks fourth among animated films.|$|E

25|$|The British National Antarctic Expedition was {{acclaimed}} {{upon its}} return {{but was also}} in serious financial trouble, and so in 1905, Discovery was sold to the Hudson's Bay Company, who used her as a cargo vessel between London and Hudson Bay, Canada until the First World War, when she began carrying munitions to Russia. In 1916, she was loaned to the British Government to rescue Shackleton's party marooned on Elephant Island, but they were rescued before she arrived. In 1917, she carried supplies to the White Russians during the Russian Civil War. At {{the end of the}} hostilities Discovery was chartered by various companies for work in the Atlantic, but outdated and outclassed by more modern merchant vessels she was soon laid <b>up,</b> <b>spending</b> the early 1920s as the headquarters of the 16th Stepney Sea Scouts.|$|E
25|$|Montoto {{has sold}} {{security}} cameras to Buenos Aires through the Global View company. In 2008, Montoto mounted a “spy system” consisting of {{over a hundred}} cameras in 75 “strategic locations” in Buenos Aires. Between August 2009 and July 2010, Codesur won five contracts to install security cameras in Buenos Aires. The firm was contracted to install 300 cameras at first, a number that later increased. In January 2010, Codesur and Cablevision both bid for a new contract with the city to install cameras. Although Cablevision's offer was cheaper, Global View was awarded the contract. The city ended <b>up</b> <b>spending</b> 250 million pesos for 2000 cameras, which experts described as “outrageous” compared to market prices. For example, compared to the 125,000 per camera that Global View charged Buenos Aires, La Matanza paid between 11,000 and 22,000 pesos per camera.|$|E

25|$|The cost of {{traveling}} over the Oregon Trail and its extensions varied from nothing {{to a few}} hundred dollars per person. Women seldom went alone. The cheapest way was to hire on to help drive the wagons or herds, allowing one to make the trip for nearly nothing or even make a small profit. Those with capital could often buy livestock in the Midwest and drive the stock to California or Oregon for profit. About 60 to 80percent of the travelers were farmers and as such already owned a wagon, livestock team, and many of the necessary supplies. This lowered the cost of the trip to about $50 per person for food and other items. Families planned the trip months in advance and made much of the extra clothing and many other items needed. Individuals buying most of the needed items would end <b>up</b> <b>spending</b> between $150–$200 per person. As the trail matured, additional costs for ferries and toll roads were thought to have been about $30 per wagon.|$|E

After much argument, Withnail insists on staying. Late in the night, Marwood keeps trying to evade Monty but he eventually corners him in the guest bedroom. Monty reveals that Withnail, when arranging to borrow the cottage, had told Monty that Marwood was a closeted homosexual and that he himself had rejected Marwood's advances. Marwood claims that Withnail is the closeted one and {{that the two of them}} have been in a committed relationship for years. He claims that Withnail is only rejecting him because Monty is around, and that this is the first night that they haven't slept together in years. Monty, a romantic, accepts this explanation and apologises for coming between them. In private, Marwood furiously confronts Withnail and insists that he will pay.|$|E
25|$|Hundreds of {{thousands}} of Japanese also surrendered to Soviet forces in the last weeks {{of the war and}} after Japan's surrender. The Soviet Union claimed to have taken 594,000 Japanese POWs, of whom 70,880 were immediately released, but Japanese researchers have estimated that 850,000 were captured. Unlike the prisoners held by China or the western Allies, these men were treated harshly by their captors, and over 60,000 died. Japanese POWs were forced to undertake hard labour and were held in primitive conditions with inadequate food and medical treatments. This treatment was similar to that experienced by German POWs in the Soviet Union. The treatment of Japanese POWs in Siberia was also similar to that suffered by Soviet prisoners who were being held in the area. Between 1946 and 1950, many of the Japanese POWs in Soviet captivity were released; those remaining after 1950 were mainly those convicted of various crimes. They were gradually released under a series of amnesties between 1953 and 1956. After the last major repatriation in 1956, the Soviets continued to hold some POWs and release them in small increments. Some ended <b>up</b> <b>spending</b> decades living in the Soviet Union, and could only return to Japan in the 1990s. Some, having spent decades away and having started families of their own, elected not to permanently settle in Japan and remain where they were.|$|E
