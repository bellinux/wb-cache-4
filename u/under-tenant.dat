500|$|William II died in {{a hunting}} {{accident}} on 2 August 1100. His younger brother Henry immediately rode to Winchester and had himself crowned king before his elder brother, Robert Curthose, could claim the throne. Although Urse did not attest the charter Henry issued after he seized the throne, Urse was at court shortly afterwards. When Robert Curthose invaded England in 1101 {{in an attempt to}} take the English throne, Urse supported Henry. Urse was present at the court held at Winchester on 2 August 1101, when a peace treaty was ratified between the brothers. During Henry's reign, the king regranted Urse's lands to him, with some of them now granted as a tenant-in-chief when previously Urse had held those lands as an <b>under-tenant,</b> and not directly from the king. Urse's lands at Salwarpe were previously held by Roger of Montgomery, but were granted to Urse as a direct tenant of the king when Roger's son, Robert of Belesme, was outlawed in 1102. Urse continued to attest many of Henry's charters until 1108, although he did not use the title of [...] "constable" [...] in those charters.|$|E
500|$|In 1086, the Domesday Survey {{documents}} {{that while the}} majority of Urse's lands were in Worcestershire, he also held land in Warwickshire, Herefordshire, and Gloucestershire. His lands in Warwickshire were held directly from the king, as a tenant-in-chief, while others were held as an <b>under-tenant</b> of others who had their lands directly from the king. Urse's lands in Herefordshire likewise were held as a mixture of tenant-in-chief and sub-tenant, as was also the case in Gloucester. Of the lands that Urse held in Worcestershire, he held them both directly from the king and from the Bishop of Worcester. Domesday also records that the revenue that Urse was responsible for as sheriff was £128 and 4 shillings from Worcestershire. This was just the amount due for the royal estates in Worcester, as Urse was also responsible for payments of £23 and 5 shillings for the royal lands in the Borough of Worcester, £17 as profits on the shire and hundred courts with an additional £16 or a hunting hawk, specifically a [...] "Norway hawk"; also due from the courts. Urse also had to pay the queen £5 plus £1 additional for a [...] "sumpter horse". All of these payments were guaranteed by Urse, who had to make up any shortfall.|$|E
2500|$|The {{organisation}} of {{the returns}} on a feudal basis, enabled the Conqueror and his officers {{to see the}} extent of a baron's possessions; and it also showed to what extent he had under-tenants, and {{the identities of the}} under-tenants. This was of great importance to William, not only for military reasons, but also because of his resolve to command the personal loyalty of the under-tenants (though the [...] "men" [...] of their lords) by making them swear allegiance to himself. As Domesday Book normally records only the Christian name of an <b>under-tenant,</b> {{it is not possible to}} search for the surnames of families claiming a Norman origin. Scholars, however, have worked to identify the under-tenants, most of whom have foreign Christian names.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, a {{practice}} had arisen, possibly {{as early as}} Richard I's reign (1189-1199), of accepting from great barons special [...] "fines" [...] for permission not to serve in a campaign. This practice appears to have rested on the crown's right {{to decide whether to}} exact personal service or to accept scutage in lieu of service. A system of special composition thus arose which largely replaced the old one of scutage. As between the tenants-in-chief, however, and their <b>under-tenants,</b> the payment of scutage continued. The terms of charters of subinfeudation, which specified the quota of scutage due rather than the proportion of a knight's fee granted, often stereotyped scutage. For the purpose of recouping themselves by levying from their <b>under-tenants,</b> the tenants-in-chief received from the crown writs de scutagio habendo. Under Edward I (reigned 1272-1307) the new system developed so completely that the six levies of the reign, each as high as two pounds on the fee, applied in practice only to the <b>under-tenants,</b> their lords compounding with the crown by the payment of large sums, though their nominal assessment, somewhat mysteriously, became much lower (see knight service).|$|R
60|$|I {{will add}} one word more, that {{by such a}} {{wholesome}} law, all the oppressions felt by <b>under-tenants</b> of Church leases, which are now laid on by the bishops would entirely be prevented, by their Graces and Lordships consenting to have their lands sold for payment of the nation's debts, reserving only the present rent for their own plentiful and honourable support.|$|R
50|$|During the Norman Conquest of England, {{a branch}} of the de Livet family {{followed}} the de Ferrers (later the Earls of Derby) to England, along with the Curzons (Notre-Dame-de-Courson) and the Baskervilles (Basqueville, now Bacqueville-en-Caux), who were also <b>under-tenants</b> of the old Ferrieres fiefdom in Normandy. The name of this branch of the de Livet family was anglicized into the name Levett, Levet, Lyvet, Livett, Leavett and its variants.|$|R
2500|$|The priory {{was soon}} {{involved}} {{in a series of}} disputes with the Parles family that lasted for several decades. In 1211 William de Parles sued the prior for 10 acres in Sandwell and in 1212 for 10 acres in Handsworth. The precise connection of the Parles family with Handsworth, to the south-east of the priory, is unclear. The manor had been part of William Fitz-Ansculf's huge holdings and would have passed via the Paynels to their successors, the de Somery family, as part of the lordship of Dudley. However, not until 1242 is there clear evidence that John de Parles held Handsworth from Roger de Somery as an <b>under-tenant.</b> It is possible that Pain de Parles acquired a foothold at Handsworth in the 12th century through his wife, Alice, but documentation is no longer extant. William de Parles claimed lands in Handsworth by right of Pain and Alice. The lay advocate of the priory was now Richard, son of the founder and grandson of Guy de Offeni. The prior called upon him to vindicate the priory's claim to the land. The result of the case is unknown. William de Parles seems to have adhered to the [...] rebel side against King John in the First Barons' War. In 1216 his Handsworth lands were confiscated and granted to Robert de Teneray. In 1222 he gave up his claim to the Sandwell land in return for £5, given to him by the advocate, Richard. However, Richard died without issue shortly after and was succeeded by his brother, William, who survived for only two more years. In June 1224 William de Parles took advantage of a perceived weakness to claim half the advowson of the priory, alleging that it was he who had presented Prior Reynold during the reign of King John. William the advocate died before the case could be settled, leaving a young son, William, as heir. The case was adjourned sine die.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of a feudal baron, that is to say one who held per barioniam, it is termed [...] "baronial relief", set at £100. Following Magna Carta of 1215, the {{standard}} rates became one quarter of a year's profit of the estate payable by an <b>under-tenant,</b> and a full year's profit payable by a non-baronial tenant-in-chief.|$|E
50|$|The two manors, {{formally}} {{owned by}} Carle & Torchil, were passed down in 1086 to Robert Count of Mortain and the Earl of Cornwall, the half-brother to William the Conqueror. Though, {{in the year}} 1088 Count Robert had his estate confiscated. There is no record of the fate of Robert's <b>under-tenant,</b> Richard de Surdeval, though it is possible his family survived as the de Sywardbys, using {{the name of the}} village.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 16th century {{overgrazing}} affected areas of both Bergholt and Cooks Hall Common, {{upon which the}} tenants of both manors shared. In 1575-6 neither unmarried tenants nor <b>under-tenants</b> of Cooks Hall manor were allowed to feed more than four sheep or any cattle on that manor's common. In 1587 and 1619 Bergholt Hall manor court forbade any tenant without a house and family to graze cattle on that manor's common. Overseers, rangers or drivers, of that common, first recorded in 1632, were in 1651 instructed to drive the heath {{at least three times}} a year and to impound illegally grazed cattle.|$|R
500|$|Basset {{appears as}} a royal justice in 1116, serving in Huntingdonshire. Basset was noted in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle entry for 1124 as hanging 44 thieves, during an eyre in Leicestershire. Possibly, Basset's {{severity}} {{was part of an}} attempt to overawe the <b>under-tenants</b> of the Beaumont twins, one of whom, Waleran, Count of Melun rebelled during 1124. During the period 1110–1127, Basset was one of the leading royal justices, and was described by the medieval chronicler Henry of Huntingdon as one of the [...] "justices of all England". Huntingdon's implication is that Basset's scope was over all of England, not limited to his own locality.|$|R
50|$|The {{settlement}} of Bucknell was first {{mentioned in the}} Domesday Book, as 'Buckehale' or 'Buckenhill. At {{the time of the}} Domesday survey, the Shropshire and Herefordshire boundary divided the village. The Norman magnate Roger de Montgomery held the village from the King. He built many castles including Montgomery, Shrewsbury, Ludlow, Clun, Hopton and Oswestry; at the time over 90 per cent of the lordships and manors of Shropshire were held in Chief by him. His <b>under-tenants</b> in this area were Ralph de Mortimer, who held Bucknell (amongst his 123 manors with his chief domain in England being at Wigmore Castle), and William de Picot, (also known as Picot de Say), with his chief domain at Clun Castle.|$|R
50|$|Herbert held land as an <b>under-tenant</b> of the Archbishop of York in the Domesday Survey of 1089. He {{held the}} office of chamberlain of the Winchester {{treasury}} {{during the reign of}} King William II of England, and {{the office of}} chancellor and treasurer under King Henry I. During William II's reign, Herbert became a tenant-in-chief, holding lands directly from the king. Herbert may have {{been a member of the}} clergy, although it is known that he was married.|$|E
5000|$|In 1447 William Sydney {{the younger}} {{obtained}} a licence to impark (i.e. enclose) 800 acres appertaining to his 'manor' of Baynards, however its exact status {{at that time}} is dubious, being possibly still held as an <b>under-tenant</b> of Pollingfold Manor to the south-west. [...] His granddaughter, as heir {{of this part of}} these larger estates, married William Uvedale, who inherited, the estate passing, after a period of profit-sharing to his several heirs, to the Bray family including, soon after by an intra-family deal, Sir Edward Bray.|$|E
50|$|About 1301 the Le Strange family sold Ruyton, {{with all}} its homages and fees, to their suzerain Edmund Fitz Alan, Earl of Arundel, which would include all their rights over Wykey and Shelvock; however about 1325 John, Lord of Shelvock gives to the Abbot of Haghmond a quit claim as to certain lands at Balderton. Apparently, Shelvock had not passed with Ruyton into the {{immediate}} possession of the Earl of Arundel, but was still held by an <b>under-tenant,</b> presumably a descendant of the William Fitz Walter to whom it had been granted in 1175.|$|E

Descendants of one branch {{of this family}} became the Marquises of Barville [...] in France (de Livet de Barville).The Norman French branch of the de Livet family counts among its members early knights (chevaliers), church officials (including Guillaume de Livet, a judge at the trial of Joan of Arc), Canon of Rouen Robert de Livet (who excommunicated King Henry V of England during his siege of Rouen, after which de Livet was imprisoned for five years in England) [...] chevalier banneret Jean de Livet (standard bearer to King Philip II of France in 1215) and early Crusaders.

25|$|The Cornwallis Code, while {{defining}} {{the rights of}} the proprietors, failed to give adequate recognition to {{the rights of the}} <b>under-tenants</b> and the cultivators.

Furthermore, the Permanent Settlement took no account of inflation, meaning that the value of the revenue to Government declined year by year, whilst the heavy burden on the peasantry grew no less. This was compounded in the early 19th century by compulsory schemes for the cultivation of Opium and Indigo, the former by the state, and the latter by British planters (most especially in the district of Tirhut in Bihar). Peasants were forced to grow a certain area of these crops, which were then purchased at below market rates for export. This added greatly to rural poverty.|$|R
50|$|On {{the death}} of Thomas Thornes his widow {{retained}} possession of Shelvock, and married George Bold, but their right to the property was evidently disputed by the family, for in 1699 a deed of family settlement was executed, dated October 30, between them and several other relatives. By this deed {{it was agreed that}} all differences and lawsuits about the land and estate of the late Francis and Thomas Thornes were to cease. The Bolds were to hold for their lives and to keep in repair the capital messuage of Shelvock, the Heath Mill, and the demesne lands belonging to Shelvock, and several properties in Shotatton which were parcel of the demesne lands of Shelvock. After the deaths of the Bolds, the whole of the above were to belong in fee simple, free from encumbrances, to Francis Thornes' four daughters and their representatives. Anne Bold, therefore, and her second husband, George Bold, had possession of Shelvock from 1678; and they were still alive in 1707, but had to let it to some <b>under-tenants.</b>|$|R
5000|$|From time to {{time the}} Lambert family paid towards the repair of the chancel, where {{services}} were still held.

The town authorised the <b>under-tenant</b> at that time, a Mr. Barber, to get the chapel repaired, and he would be reimbursed from the rent he paid for the lands [...] "provided always he does not disburse above [...] shillings". Unsurprisingly, the little church continued to be in a sad state.|$|E
5000|$|It seems {{probable}} that the bishop had bought out the <b>under-tenant</b> {{and that the}} manor had always been an outlying member of Hatfield, for as parochially Totteridge was a chapelry of Hatfield {{there must have been}} some ancient connection between the two places, and in 1277 it was returned as [...] "accustomed to return half a knight's fee in the manor of Hatfield." [...] In {{the second half of the}} 13th century, the manor seems to have been held by Laurence de Brok for life, for in 1275, Matilda, widow of Laurence, claimed a third of the manor in dower from Bishop Hugh and had it duly delivered.

50|$|The <b>under-tenants</b> of John Ross {{who held}} land in Haining-Ross had become {{concerned}} {{as to their}} legal status because their superior had failed for forty years to formally acquire possession of the barony. Among those with an interest at this time were John Ross, James Ross, James Ross, the younger, Andrew/Alexander Ross, Robert Ross of Thornton and Hugh Ross. In 1597 Matthew Ross of Haining and Galston was given formal possession of Haining-Ross; his daughter Janet married Hugh Kennedy of Bennane. In 1599 John Ross and Marion Hamilton of Haining are recorded as having three sons James, Thomas, Matthew and Allen. In 1611 Marion Hamilton Ross was recorded as 'lady of Haining'.

5000|$|Although a tacksman {{generally}} paid {{a yearly}} rent {{for the land}} let to him (his [...] "tack"), his tenure might last for several generations. He would often be related to his landlord, the free-holder, and might, for example, represent a cadet branch {{of the family of}} the clan chief. The tacksman in turn would let out his land to sub-tenants, but he might keep some in hand himself.Dr Johnson defined the class in this manner: Next in dignity to the laird is the Tacksman; a large taker or lease-holder of land, of which he keeps part as a domain in his own hand, and lets part to <b>under-tenants.</b> The tacksman is necessarily a man capable of securing to the laird the whole rent, and is commonly a collateral relation. These tacks, or subordinate possessions, were long considered as hereditary, and the occupant was distinguished by the name of the place at which he resided. He held a middle station, by which the highest and the lowest orders were connected. He paid rent and reverence to the laird, and received them from the tenants. This tenure still subsists, with its original operation, but not with its primitive stability.|$|R
50|$|Before the Reformation, {{the land}} {{which was to}} become {{the site of the}} hotel was part of the {{accommodation}} for Exeter Cathedral's Vicars choral. The site was later leased to a variety of tenants until in March 1766 the Reverend John Lee of Lympstone assigned the lease of the premises that he held there to William Mackworth Praed (1747-1833). Praed was a son of William Mackworth Praed, a lawyer and politician who had died in 1752. At the time of the transfer, part of the premises leased by John Lee was occupied by an <b>under-tenant,</b> a French school master named Peter Berlon, and Praed engaged him to manage the planned development of the site. Praed acquired other adjacent premises too, including the freehold of a property half way along St Martin's Lane, and dilapidated property in High Street, which he redeveloped separately. He also developed the adjacent building on the corner of St Martin's Lane for the Exeter Bank, of which {{he was one of the}} founding members, with John Duntze, Joseph Sanders and Daniel Hamilton.|$|E
50|$|The {{same system}} was adopted in Ireland when that country was conquered under Henry II. The magnate {{who had been}} enfeoffed by his {{sovereign}} for his honour of land could provide the knights required either by hiring them for pay or, more conveniently when wealth was mainly represented by land, by a process of subinfeudation, analogous to that by which he himself had been enfeoffed. That is to say, he could assign to an <b>under-tenant</b> a certain portion of his fief to be held by direct military service or the service of providing a mercenary knight. The land so held would then be described as consisting {{of one or more}} knight's fees, but the knight's-fee had not any fixed area, as different soils and climates required differing acreages to produce a given profit requisite to support a knight and his entourage. This process could be carried farther till there was a chain of mesne lords between the tenant-in-chief and the actual occupier of the land. The liability for performance of the knight-service was however always carefully defined.|$|E
50|$|The clearest {{proof of}} the ancient status of the Southwark free-tenants is their first written appearance; this is in Domesday Book {{compiled}} in 1086 for William I ‘the Conqueror’. This was a national record of account to list what was owed to the king by his tenants in chief, his fellow Norman conquerors and the senior Prelates of the Church, whom were the greatest landholders. These in turn had sub-let to others, so that ownership and duties, either food-rents or military services, had become confused as to who owed them, the tenant in chief or the <b>under-tenant.</b> The king therefore sent his commissioners across the nation to interrogate these to provide evidences, they also asked the king’s local agent in the shires or counties to confirm these statements, the ‘shire-reeves’. These sheriffs could not know everything, but they could ask the local freemen on oath to announce their opinion of this information. The {{point is that the}} freemen could express the truth in the knowledge of royal protection from the wrath of local magnates. In the sections of Domesday Book in regard to this manor, the ‘Men of Southwark’ are shown as doing this.|$|E

They were stopped at Cossimbazar by Noor Sing Baboo, the brother of Cantoo Baboo, and there the matter was compromised,--in what manner I cannot say." ...|$|R
5|$|As chief {{financial}} administrator, he bore {{the brunt of}} the chronicler's condemnations for extortion and efforts to increase royal revenues. Besides attempts to increase the efficiency of collection and the rate of taxation, Ranulf created new methods of raising money. One of his new measures in revenue collection came in 1094, when the fyrd, or English militia, was assembled to fight in Normandy against the king's brother Robert Curthose. When all the men had assembled, instead of sending them to Normandy, Ranulf dismissed them, after collecting the 10 shillings that each man had been given by their district for maintenance. Ranulf then spent the money on mercenaries. Ranulf also actively pressed lawsuits, including bringing suit against Anselm on the day of Anselm's consecration as Archbishop of Canterbury. Another innovation was the attempt to collect a relief, much like the relief due from vassals at the death of an overlord, from the <b>under-tenants</b> of church lands when the church office changed hands. This attempt came at the death of Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester in 1095, when the king sent writs to the free tenants of the bishop, setting the amount of relief owed to the king. This attempt was not repeated, however.|$|R
5000|$|For some time, {{two kinds}} of {{alienation}} had been occurring. These were [...] "substitution" [...] and [...] "subinfeudation". In substitution, the tenant would alienate his land, and the attendant duties owed to the lord. After alienation, the tenant expected nothing from the new tenant, other than {{the price of the}} alienation. In subinfeudation, the new tenant would become a serf owing feudal duties to the person who alienated. The previous tenant would become the lord to the new tenant. Both these practices had the effect of denying the great lord of the land his rights of feudal estate. The bond of homage was between lord and servant. It was difficult for the medieval mind to think of this in any terms other than as a personal bond. The idea that a feudal bond could be bought or sold was repugnant to the ruling class. All the same, the practice of alienation of rights to the land had been going on in England for some centuries. A tenant who was accepted in homage by the lord could [...] "subinfeudate" [...] to one or more <b>under-tenants.</b> It was difficult or impossible for the overlord to extract any services (such as knight service, rent, homage) from the new tenants. They had no bond to the overlord. Pollock and Maitland give the following example: In the case of subinfeudation, the old tenant was liable for services to the lord. If A enfoeffed to B to hold a knight's service, and then B enfoeffed C to hold as a rent of a pound of pepper per year; B dies leaving an heir within age; A is entitled to a wardship; but it will be worth very little: instead of being entitled to enjoy the land itself until the heir is of age, he will get a few annual pounds of pepper. Instead of enjoying the land by escheat, he will only receive a trifling rent. Quia Emptores in 1290 ended all subinfeudation and made all alienation complete. Once a sale of land was made, the new owner was responsible for all feudal incidents.|$|R
50|$|The Yaxley {{family was}} first founded in Suffolk where {{they held a}} family-seat as Lords of the Manor. After the Battle of Hastings in 1066, William, Duke of Normandy, having prevailed over King Harold, granted most of Britain to his many victorious Barons. It was not {{uncommon}} to find a Baron or a Bishop with 60 or more Lordships scattered throughout the country. These he gave to his sons, nephews and other junior lines {{of his family and}} they became known as under-tenants. They adopted the Norman system of surnames which identified the <b>under-tenant</b> with his holdings so as to distinguish him from the senior stem of the family. After many rebellious wars between his Barons, Duke William commissioned a census of all England to determine in 1086, settling once and for all, who held which lands. He called the census the Domesday Book, indicating that those holders registered would hold the land until the end of time. Hence, conjecturally, the surname is descended from the tenant of the lands of Yaxley, held by Hubert, a Norman noble from William Malet his over lord, who was recorded in the Domesday Book census of 1086.|$|E

His younger brother Henry immediately rode to Winchester and had himself crowned king before his elder brother, Robert Curthose, could claim the throne. Although Urse did not attest the charter Henry issued after he seized the throne, Urse was at court shortly afterwards. When Robert Curthose invaded England in 1101 {{in an attempt to}} take the English throne, Urse supported Henry. Urse was present at the court held at Winchester on 2 August 1101, when a peace treaty was ratified between the brothers. During Henry's reign, the king regranted Urse's lands to him, with some of them now granted as a tenant-in-chief when previously Urse had held those lands as an <b>under-tenant,</b> and not directly from the king. Urse's lands at Salwarpe were previously held by Roger of Montgomery, but were granted to Urse as a direct tenant of the king when Roger's son, Robert of Belesme, was outlawed in 1102. Urse continued to attest many of Henry's charters until 1108, although he did not use the title of [...] "constable" [...] in those charters.|$|E
5000|$|In 1086, the Domesday Survey {{documents}} {{that while the}} majority of Urse's lands were in Worcestershire, he also held land in Warwickshire, Herefordshire, and Gloucestershire.

Urse's lands in Herefordshire likewise were held as a mixture of tenant-in-chief and sub-tenant, as was also the case in Gloucester. Of the lands that Urse held in Worcestershire, he held them both directly from the king and from the Bishop of Worcester. Domesday also records that the revenue that Urse was responsible for as sheriff was £128 and 4 shillings from Worcestershire. This was just the amount due for the royal estates in Worcester, as Urse was also responsible for payments of £23 and 5 shillings for the royal lands in the Borough of Worcester, £17 as profits on the shire and hundred courts with an additional £16 or a hunting hawk, specifically a [...] "Norway hawk"; also due from the courts. Urse also had to pay the queen £5 plus £1 additional for a [...] "sumpter horse". All of these payments were guaranteed by Urse, who had to make up any shortfall.|$|E
6000|$|The maxim, [...] "That {{people are}} the riches of a nation," [...] hath been crudely {{understood}} by many writers and reasoners upon that subject. There are several ways by which people are brought into a country. Sometimes a nation is invaded and subdued; and the conquerors seize the lands, and make the natives their <b>under-tenants</b> or servants. Colonies have been always planted where the natives were driven out or destroyed, or the land uncultivated and waste. In those countries where {{the lord of the}} soil is master of the labour and liberty of his tenants, or of slaves bought by his money, men's riches are reckoned by the number of their vassals. And sometimes, in governments newly instituted, where there are not people to till the ground, many laws have been made to encourage and allure numbers from the neighbouring countries. And, in all these cases, the new comers have either lands allotted them, or are slaves to the proprietors. But to invite helpless families, by thousands, into a kingdom inhabited like ours, without lands to give them, and where the laws will not allow that they {{should be part of the}} property as servants, is a wrong application of the maxim, and the same thing, in great, as infants dropped at the doors, which are only a burthen and charge to the parish. The true way of multiplying mankind to public advantage, in such a country as England, is to invite from abroad only able handicraftsmen and artificers, or such who bring over a sufficient share of property to secure them from want; to enact and enforce sumptuary laws against luxury, and all excesses in clothing, furniture, and the like; to encourage matrimony, and reward, as the Romans did, those who have a certain number of children. Whether bringing over the Palatines were a mere consequence of this law for a general naturalization; or whether, as many surmised, it had some other meaning, it appeared manifestly, by the issue, that the public was a loser by every individual among them; and that a kingdom can no more be the richer by such an importation, than a man can be fatter by a wen, which is unsightly and troublesome, at best, and intercepts that nourishment, which would otherwise diffuse itself through the whole body.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} notes {{appear in}} the Explanatory Statement at start of Return:As the term [...] " [...] Domesday Book" [...] has been frequently applied to the present Return, {{it may not be}} out of place to refer briefly to the celebrated Survey of the Kingdom which was made by command of the Conqueror, to show the different character of the two undertakings, and the different means resorted to in their compilation.In the year 1085 serious apprehensions appear to have been entertained of an invasion of the kingdom by the Danes, and the difficulty which the King then experienced in putting the country into a satisfactory state of defence led him to form the notion of having a general survey made of the whole kingdom, so, as Sir Martin Wright observes, [...] "to discover [...] " [...] the quantity of every man's fee, and to fix his homage," [...] or, in other words, to ascertain the quantity of land held by each person, and the quota of military aid which he was bound to furnish in proportion to the extent of his holding.To secure accuracy of results, Commissioners or King's Justiciaries (Legati Regis) were appointed with ample powers to ascertain [...] " [...] upon the oath of the several Sheriffs, Lords of Manors, Presbyters, Reeves, Bailiffs, or Villans, according to [...] " [...] the nature of the place, what {{was the name of the}} place, who held it in the time of the Confessor, who was the present [...] " [...] holder, how many hides of land there were in the manor, how many carrucates in demesne, how many homagers, how many [...] " [...] villans, how many cotarii, how many servi, what freemen, how many tenants in socage, what quanity of wood, how much [...] " [...] meadow and pasture, what mills and fish-ponds, how much added or taken away, what was the gross value in King [...] " [...] Edward's time, what the present value, and how much each free-man or soc-man had or has." [...] All this was to be estimated—1st, as the estate was held in the time of the Confessor; 2ndly, as it was bestowed by the King himself; and, 3rdly, as its value stood at the time of the survey.All these particulars were ascertained for each county, the Commissioners sending in Returns (breviates) for each county separately, and from these Returns Domesday Book, or the General Register for the whole kingdom, was compiled.It will be seen, therefore, that the object of the Conqueror's survey was to ascertain the amount of military service and other assistance upon which he could depend; and that for this purpose he instituted an inquiry of a very searching and inquisitorial character into the nature and extent of the landed possessions of his subjects, sending special Commissioners into every locality, with power to summon the inhabitants and compel them to make a full disclosure of their property on oath.Notwithstanding, however, these stringent measures for insuring accuracy, there is no doubt that the Commissioners did not always obtain or furnish correct information, and that sometimes, as in the case of the present Return, the statements of what we should now designate as the [...] " [...] Gross Estimated Rental," [...] and the [...] " [...] Estimated Extent," [...] are not altogether reliable. Ingulph, the historian of Croyland, in referring to the survey of the possessions of that abbey, expressly says, [...] " [...] Isti" [...] (taxatores) [...] " [...] penes nostrum monasterium benevoli et amantes non ad verum pretium nec ad verum [...] " [...] spatium nostrum monasterium librabant, misericorditer praecaventes in futurum exactionibus et aliis oneribus, piisima [...] " [...] nobis benevolentia providentes."—Oxford edition, p. 79.With respect to the result of this inquiry, so far as it discloses the number of landowners existing at that time, it must be observed that although the Domesday Book may be considered as a fair record of the number of persons having a direct interest in land, it is almost impossible, owing to the different designations under -which they are classified, to distinguish those who may properly be considered as owners from those who were in the possession of land as mere occupiers only.The following estimate, which is extracted from the work of Sir H. Ellis, may perhaps be taken as showing proximately the number of persons who can properly be regarded as having claim to be considered as holders of land upon some legally recognised tenure :*Tenants in capite, or persons holding directly from the Crown : 1,400*Subfeudatarii, or <b>under-tenants</b> holding their estates from some mesne Lord : 7,871*Liberi homines, or freeholders under the Lord of a manor, usually by military service: 12,400 *Sochemanni or Socmen, holding on some fixed and determined rent service:23,072*Homines, or feudatory tenants holding on homage:1,300*Cotarii and Coscets, or cottagers holding small parcels of land :7,000*Presbyteri, or clergy:1,000*Eadmanni, a species of tenants in socage: 370*Milites, or persons holding under mesne Lords in respect of military service:140*Aloarii, or absolute hereditary owners:12*Other owners, viz., Angli and Anglici, Beures or Coliberti, Censarii or Censores, &c:248Total of recorded landholders: 54,813The Burgenses, or Burgesses, who were returned as 7,968, are not included in the above list, as it is impossible to distinguish those who held lands in their individual from those who held in a corporate capacity, and many of them were evidently not owners in any sense of the term.Moreover the Villeins, of whom there were 108,407, are omitted, because it is quite certain that, when they occupied small portions of land, they did so on sufferance only. In fact they were regarded as mere chattels, which could be bought or sold, and they were not allowed by law to acquire any property, either in land or in goods.It should be added that the present counties of Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Durham were not included in the survey.|$|R
50|$|The priory {{was soon}} {{involved}} {{in a series of}} disputes with the Parles family that lasted for several decades. In 1211 William de Parles sued the prior for 10 acres in Sandwell and in 1212 for 10 acres in Handsworth. The precise connection of the Parles family with Handsworth, to the south-east of the priory, is unclear. The manor had been part of William Fitz-Ansculf's huge holdings and would have passed via the Paynels to their successors, the de Somery family, as part of the lordship of Dudley. However, not until 1242 is there clear evidence that John de Parles held Handsworth from Roger de Somery as an <b>under-tenant.</b> It is possible that Pain de Parles acquired a foothold at Handsworth in the 12th century through his wife, Alice, but documentation is no longer extant. William de Parles claimed lands in Handsworth by right of Pain and Alice. The lay advocate of the priory was now Richard, son of the founder and grandson of Guy de Offeni. The prior called upon him to vindicate the priory's claim to the land. The result of the case is unknown. William de Parles seems to have adhered to the rebel side against King John in the First Barons' War. In 1216 his Handsworth lands were confiscated and granted to Robert de Teneray. In 1222 he gave up his claim to the Sandwell land in return for £5, given to him by the advocate, Richard. However, Richard died without issue shortly after and was succeeded by his brother, William, who survived for only two more years. In June 1224 William de Parles took advantage of a perceived weakness to claim half the advowson of the priory, alleging that it was he who had presented Prior Reynold during the reign of King John. William the advocate died before the case could be settled, leaving a young son, William, as heir. The case was adjourned sine die.|$|E
