In contrast to The Green Pastures and its portrayal of rural black culture, the cartoon is set in a solidly <b>urban</b> <b>framework.</b> Clean Pastures replaces stereotypes of black watermelon eaters and chicken stealers with black dancers, drinkers, and gamblers.

Yet even Bill [...] "Bojangles" [...] Robinson and Al Jolson, who built their careers on blackface depictions of rural blacks, reject Fetchit's plea for souls and opt for the Kotton Klub nightclub.

40|$|The {{following}} dissertation {{will attempt}} to establish an {{approach to dealing with}} the issue of waste contamination and water conservation in the natural and urban landscapes of the riverbed, its rivers' edges and its man-made peripheries. This research locates itself at the northern boundary of the city of Windhoek along a stretch of polluted riverbed in the Kilimanjaro Informal Settlement (KIS) where public environments are undefined, unhealthy and in many ways disconnected from the greater metropolitan areas. In the creation of an architectural approach 'urban acupuncture' will be explored in an attempt to create Architecture that has the potential to influence areas beyond its physical boundaries and which can re-establish and re-imagine the value of the river for its unseen influence in shaping the city as rapid urbanisation is taking place. In this section of the city, particular aspects of environmental degradation, water conservation and lack of basic infrastructure form a basis of inquiry to which an <b>urban</b> <b>framework</b> has been proposed. Drawing on theories of landscape urbanism, this <b>urban</b> <b>framework</b> acts to establish an alternative and more efficient infrastructural system which collects, stores, recycles and reuses wastewater for both drinking and irrigation purposes.

40|$|This paper explores, {{through the}} example of the Slow City (Cittaslow) movement, how an {{analytical}} focus on the experiential dimensions of urban experience adds new layers of knowledge to our understandings of how and why town leaders engage with <b>urban</b> <b>frameworks</b> and principles. The global growth of the Italian-based Cittaslow movement has been explained both as part of a deceleration narrative and as a transferable <b>urban</b> development <b>framework.</b> We show how an approach that takes the experiential as its analytical starting point offers an alternative interpretation of the movement&# 039;s contemporary growing global membership. Cittaslow aims to ensure quality of life in its towns and seeks to create an environmentally sustainable and pleasurable future. Drawing on research in Spanish Cittaslow towns, we examine the terms upon which town leaders engage with the movement&# 039;s ideas and framework. We propose that Cittaslow is appealing to town leaders because it enables them not only to identify the qualities of their towns against its membership criteria, but also to invest in its framework normally unspoken, embodied, sensory, and tacit dimensions of their towns. A focus on the experiential, we suggest, is key to understanding the movement&# 039;s appeal to town leaders across diverse cultural and national context...|$|R

This progress is demonstrated through increasingly dominant new interventions which also demonstrate where the building opens up to the public. A program for the building is {{based on the results of}} site analysis, and in response to the <b>urban</b> <b>framework.</b> This program stimulates progress for people by creating a place that supports the production of entrepreneurs and encourages economic upliftment. The adapted building will contain an affordable housing component, rentable workshops, training facilities where people can learn business skills and crafts, a large artists’ studio, a restaurant and an arts and crafts exhibition gallery.

40|$|For half a century, urban {{metabolism}} {{has been}} used to provide insights to support transitions to sustainable urban development (SUD). Internet and Communication Technology (ICT) has recently been recognized as a potential technology enabler to advance this transition. This thesis explored the potential for an ICT-enabled <b>urban</b> metabolism <b>framework</b> aimed at improving resource efficiency in urban areas by supporting decision-making processes. Three research objectives were identified: i) investigation of how the <b>urban</b> metabolism <b>framework,</b> aided by ICT, could be utilized to support decision-making processes; ii) development of an ICT platform that manages real-time, high spatial and temporal resolution urban metabolism data and evaluation of its implementation; and iii) identification of the potential for efficiency improvements through the use of resulting high spatial and temporal resolution urban metabolism data. The work to achieve these objectives was based on literature reviews, single-case study research in Stockholm, software engineering research, and big data analytics of resulting data. The evolved <b>framework,</b> Smart <b>Urban</b> Metabolism (SUM), enabled by the emerging context of smart cities, operates at higher temporal (up to real-time), and spatial (up to household/individual) data resolution. A key finding was that the new framework overcomes some of the barriers identified for the conventional <b>urban</b> metabolism <b>framework.</b> The results confirm that there are hidden urban patterns that may be uncovered by analyzing structured big urban data. Some of those patterns may lead to the identification of appropriate intervention measures for SUD. QC 20151120 Smart City SR...|$|R
