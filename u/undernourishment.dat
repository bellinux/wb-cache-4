5|$|As {{part of the}} trade, infants {{are pulled}} prematurely from their parents, leaving them unable to remove their own urine, feces, and oily skin {{secretions}} from their fur. Slow lorises have a special network of blood vessels in their hands and feet, which makes them vulnerable to cuts when pulled from the wire cages they are kept in. Slow lorises are also stress-sensitive and do not do well in captivity. Common health problems seen in pet slow lorises include <b>undernourishment,</b> tooth decay, diabetes, obesity, and kidney failure. Infection, stress, pneumonia, and poor nutrition lead to high death rates among pet lorises. Pet owners also fail to provide proper care because they are usually asleep when the nocturnal pet is awake.|$|E
25|$|Governments alone cannot end {{hunger and}} <b>undernourishment.</b> Mobilization {{of the public}} and private sectors, the {{involvement}} of civil society and the pooling of collective and individual resources are all needed if people are {{to break out of the}} vicious circle of chronic hunger and <b>undernourishment.</b>|$|E
25|$|With its {{prevalence}} of <b>undernourishment</b> (PoU) indicator, the FAO reported that almost 870 {{million people were}} chronically undernourished in the years 2010â€“2012. This represents 12.5% of the global population, or 1 in 8 people. Higher rates occur in developing countries, where 852 million people (about 15% of the population) are chronically undernourished. The report noted that Asia and Latin America have achieved reductions in rates of <b>undernourishment</b> that put these regions on track for achieving the Millennium Development Goal of halving the {{prevalence of}} <b>undernourishment</b> by 2015. The UN noted that about 2 billion people do not consume a sufficient amount of vitamins and minerals. In India, the second-most populous country in the world, 30 million people {{have been added to}} the ranks of the hungry since the mid-1990s and 46% of children are underweight.|$|E
25|$|Malnutrition is a {{condition}} that results from eating a diet in which nutrients are either not enough or are too much such that the diet causes health problems. It may involve calories, protein, carbohydrates, vitamins or minerals. Not enough nutrients is called undernutrition or <b>undernourishment</b> while too much is called overnutrition. Malnutrition {{is often used to}} specifically refer to undernutrition where an individual is not getting enough calories, protein, or micronutrients. If undernutrition occurs during pregnancy, or before two years of age, it may result in permanent problems with physical and mental development. Extreme <b>undernourishment,</b> known as starvation, may have symptoms that include: a short height, thin body, very poor energy levels, and swollen legs and abdomen. People also often get infections and are frequently cold. The symptoms of micronutrient deficiencies depend on the micronutrient that is lacking.|$|E
25|$|According to the World Health Organization, hunger is {{the single}} gravest threat to the world's public health. The WHO also states that {{malnutrition}} {{is by far the}} biggest contributor to child mortality, present in half of all cases. Undernutrition is a contributory factor in the death of 3.1 million children under five every year. Figures on actual starvation are difficult to come by, but according to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the less severe condition of <b>undernourishment</b> currently affects about 842 million people, or about one in eight (12.5%) people in the world population.|$|E
25|$|The FAO {{noted that}} some {{countries}} {{have been successful in}} fighting food insecurity and decreasing the number of people suffering from <b>undernourishment.</b> Bangladesh {{is an example of a}} country that has met the Millennium Development Goal hunger target. The FAO credited growth in agricultural productivity and macroeconomic stability for the rapid economic growth in the 1990s that resulted in an increase in food security. Irrigation systems were established through infrastructure development programs. Two programs, HarvestPlus and the Golden Rice Project, provided biofortified crops in order to decrease micronutrient deficiencess.|$|E
25|$|The Special Programme for Food Security is FAO's {{flagship}} initiative for reaching {{the goal of}} halving the number of hungry {{in the world by}} 2015 (currently estimated at close to 1 billion people), as part of its commitment to the Millennium Development Goals. Through projects in over 100 countries worldwide, the programme promotes effective, tangible solutions to the elimination of hunger, <b>undernourishment</b> and poverty. Currently 102 countries are engaged in the programme and of these approximately 30 have begun shifting from pilot to national programmes. To maximize the impact of its work, FAO strongly promotes national ownership and local empowerment in the countries in which it operates.|$|E
25|$|The FAO, World Food Programme (WFP), and International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) {{collaborate}} {{to produce}} The State of Food Insecurity in the World. The 2012 edition described improvements {{made by the}} FAO to the prevalence of <b>undernourishment</b> (PoU) indicator {{that is used to}} measure rates of food insecurity. New features include revised minimum dietary energy requirements for individual countries, updates to the world population data, and estimates of food losses in retail distribution for each country. Measurements that factor into the indicator include dietary energy supply, food production, food prices, food expenditures, and volatility of the food system. The stages of food insecurity range from food secure situations to full-scale famine.|$|E
25|$|The Beothuks {{attempted}} to avoid Europeans in Newfoundland by moving from their traditional settlements. First they {{attempted to}} move to different coastal areas of Newfoundland where the Europeans did not have fishing camps set up, but soon they were so overrun {{that they had to}} move into inland Newfoundland. The Beothuks' main food sources were traditionally caribou, fish and seals, but their forced migration inland deprived them of two of these. This led to the over-hunting of caribou to survive, which soon led to a decrease in the caribou population in Newfoundland. The Beothuks were put into a position where they were forced from their traditional land and lifestyle into ecosystems that could not support them and that led to <b>undernourishment</b> and eventually starvation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Undernourishment</b> is {{most often}} due to not enough {{high-quality}} food being available to eat. This is often related to high food prices and poverty. A lack of breastfeeding may contribute, as may a number of infectious diseases such as: gastroenteritis, pneumonia, malaria, and measles, which increase nutrient requirements. There are two main types of undernutrition: protein-energy malnutrition and dietary deficiencies. Protein-energy malnutrition has two severe forms: marasmus (a lack of protein and calories) and kwashiorkor (a lack of just protein). Common micronutrient deficiencies include: a lack of iron, iodine, and vitamin A. During pregnancy, due to the body's increased need, deficiencies may become more common. In some developing countries, overnutrition {{in the form of}} obesity is beginning to present within the same communities as undernutrition. Other causes of malnutrition include anorexia nervosa and bariatric surgery.|$|E
25|$|In 1906, {{children}} {{were provided with}} free school meals. However, many local councils ignored this system, as it was not compulsory for them to provide the free meals and {{the cost to the}} council was far greater than was subsidised for. The provision of free school meals was made compulsory in 1914, in which year fourteen million meals per school day were served (compared with nine million per school day in 1910), most of which were free. In 1912, half of all councils in Britain were offering the scheme. Recruitment for the Second Boer War demonstrated the <b>undernourishment</b> and illness among the working classes, and there were fears over future generations being unable to maintain military control of Britain's empire. Also, following an unfavourable report by the Board of Education's inspectors on infant education in 1906, school provision for children under five was restricted (previously, the normal age for the entry of working-class children into full-time education had been three). In 1907, the Notification of Births Act came into being, which sought to quantify and analyse the causes of (and ultimately further reduce) infant mortality.|$|E
500|$|Holocaust {{victims were}} people who were {{targeted}} by the government of Nazi Germany for various discriminatory practices due to ethnicity, religion, political beliefs, or sexual orientation. [...] These institutionalized practices came to be called The Holocaust, and began with legalized social discrimination against specific groups, and involuntary hospitalization, euthanasia, and forced sterilization of those considered physically or mentally unfit for society. [...] These practices escalated during World War II to include non-judicial incarceration, confiscation of property, forced labor, sexual slavery, medical experimentation, and death through overwork, <b>undernourishment,</b> and execution through a variety of methods, with genocide of different groups as the primary goal.|$|E
500|$|By May, Belgian numbers {{had risen}} to 2,500 men, {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel Leopold Dronkers-Martens. The rainy season had begun, turning the main road from Sudan into mud, cutting off their {{communications}} and supplies. The Baro and Sobat rivers were still too low to permit the passage of supply barges from the White Nile, and the nearby Gambela airfield was too small for transport aircraft to land. The only means of supply was by airdrop, forcing the Belgians and Congolese to halve their rations. Several porters attempted to bring food in by foot [...] from Sudan, but died of fatigue and <b>undernourishment.</b> Some of the officers resorted to stripping the camouflage netting from their trucks and seining the Baro River for fish amid frequent outbreaks of Beriberi. The Italians, encamped on fertile soil and well supplied, faced no such problems. The Belgians were also subject to regular air attack.|$|E
500|$|Song Ci (1186â€“1249) was a Chinese {{physician}} and judge during the Southern Song dynasty. His famous work Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified was {{a basis for}} early forensic science in China. Song's predecessor Shen Kuo offered critical analysis of human anatomy, dispelling the old Chinese belief that the human throat had three valves instead of two. A Chinese autopsy in the early 12th century confirmed Shen's hypothesis of two throat valves: the esophagus and larynx. [...] However, dissection and examination of human bodies for solving criminal cases was of interest to Song Ci. His work was compiled {{on the basis of}} other Chinese works dealing with justice and forensics. His book provided a list of types of death (strangulation, drowning, poison, blows, etc.) and a means of physical examination in order to distinguish between murder, suicide, or accident. Besides instructions on proper ways to examine corpses, Song Ci also provided instructions on providing first aid for victims close to death from hanging, drowning, sunstroke, freezing to death, and <b>undernourishment.</b> For the specific case of drowning, Song Ci advised using the first aid technique of artificial respiration. He wrote of examinations of victims' bodies performed in the open amongst official clerks and attendants, a coroner's assistant (or midwife in the case of women), actual accused suspect of the crime and relatives of the deceased, with the results of the autopsy called out loud to the group and noted in the inquest report.

Also, studies by INEI, the national statistics bureau show that the number of Peruvians living in poverty increased dramatically (from 41.6% to more than 70%) during Alan GarcÃ­a's term, but they actually decreased (from more than 70% to 54%) during Fujimori's term.

5000|$|<b>Undernourishment,</b> or hunger, {{according}} to the FAO, is dietary intake below the minimum daily energy requirement. The amount of <b>undernourishment</b> is calculated utilizing the average amount of food available for consumption, {{the size of the}} population, the relative disparities in access to the food, and the minimum calories required for each individual. According to FAO, 868 million people (12% of the global population) were undernourished in 2012. This has decreased across the world since 1990, in all regions except for Africa, where <b>undernourishment</b> has steadily increased. [...] However, the rates of decrease are not sufficient to meet the first Millennium Development Goal of halving hunger between 1990 and 2015. The global financial, economic, and food price crisis in 2008 drove many people to hunger, especially women and children. The spike in food prices prevented many people from escaping poverty, because the poor spend a larger proportion of their income on food and farmers are net consumers of food. High food prices cause consumers to have less purchasing power and to substitute more-nutritious foods with low-cost alternatives.|$|E
