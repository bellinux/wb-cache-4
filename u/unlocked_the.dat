5|$|Rare Replay was {{announced}} during the Microsoft press {{conference at the}} June 2015 Electronic Entertainment Expo. The reveal was leaked in the hours prior to the show. The compilation was released as an Xbox One exclusive worldwide on August 4, 2015. There are no plans for a Windows 10 release or downloadable content additions. While Rare's founders, the Stamper brothers, were not interviewed in the bonus features, Tim Stamper appeared in a Develop interview set {{to coincide with the}} compilation's release. Rare also added a tie-in wherein Rare Replay owners <b>unlocked</b> <b>the</b> Battletoads character Rash as a playable character in the 2013 fighting game Killer Instinct during a limited test period.|$|E
5|$|The Fuchikoma is {{equipped}} with twin machine guns and guided missiles. Both weapons have unlimited ammunition, however up to six missiles can be launched at once after a charge time. Grenades can be found throughout missions and a maximum of three can be carried at a time. Enemies vary from humanoid robots to helicopters and sport an array of firearms and explosives. Some stages of the game are governed by a time limit. Seventeen cutscenes can be unlocked throughout the missions and depending on the player's score in training mode. Once <b>unlocked,</b> <b>the</b> cutscenes can be reviewed on the options menu.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Valkyira Chronicles games, Valkyria Chronicles III is a tactical role-playing game where players {{take control of}} a military unit and take part in missions against enemy forces. Stories are told through comic book-like panels with animated character portraits, with characters speaking partially through voiced speech bubbles and partially through unvoiced text. The player progresses {{through a series of}} linear missions, gradually unlocked as maps that can be freely scanned through and replayed as they are <b>unlocked.</b> <b>The</b> route to each story location on the map varies depending on an individual player's approach: when one option is selected, the other is sealed off to the player. Outside missions, the player characters rest in a camp, where units can be customized and character growth occurs. Alongside the main story missions are character-specific sub missions relating to different squad members. After the game's completion, additional episodes are unlocked, some of them having a higher difficulty than those found {{in the rest of the}} game. There are also love simulation elements related to the game's two main heroines, although they take a very minor role.|$|E
5000|$|Users {{are able}} to gain root {{privileges}} on the device by first unlocking its bootloader using the fastboot command [...] and flashing a package that adds the functionality to the system or by uploading specially crafted data packages via the adb program without <b>the</b> need to <b>unlock</b> <b>the</b> bootloader. <b>Unlocking</b> <b>the</b> bootloader or rooting the device allows the user to install non-official firmware images. Additionally, obtaining root privileges enables a user to override protected operating system features, and install arbitrary software. If the fastboot command is used to <b>unlock</b> <b>the</b> bootloader, the user is presented with a Google-created screen stating that <b>unlocking</b> <b>the</b> bootloader will void the warranty as well as void any insurance plan, which the user is required to accept.|$|R

5|$|During 1997, {{there were}} five {{incidents}} where NSB's Nordic Mobile Telephone equipment interfered with the locomotive's electronics, causing the emergency brakes to activate. This caused a temporary halt until the motorman had <b>unlocked</b> <b>the</b> brakes. The problem was fixed by moving NSB's mobile senders. The units were taken into use on the Bergen Line from 5 January 1997. Later they entered into use on the Dovre and Sørland Lines, and then on regional trains around Oslo, such as the Vestfold Line. In August 1998, NSB stated that El 18 used more power {{than some of the}} substation transformers along the line could handle, particularly along the Vestfold Line. Part of the problem was caused by a mechanism in the locomotives whereby the motor was turned off if the wheels spin. The result was that the full power output of the El 18 along parts of the railway network could not be utilized.|$|E
5|$|It was determined, however, {{that both}} crewmembers aboard the Marine F-4B could {{have survived the}} collision. Further {{investigation}} by the NTSB revealed a design flaw in the ejector seat and canopy assemblies of the fighter plane whereby the pilot would probably {{not be able to}} eject if the radar intercept officer ejected first. Since the specific design of ejector seats installed in the F-4B were not intended to be fired through the aircraft's canopy, a circuit breaker kept the seat from ejecting if the canopy was in place. Once the canopy was manually <b>unlocked,</b> <b>the</b> ejector seat circuit was completed and could be fired. This specific design of ejector seat, however, had a tendency of being unable to complete the circuit in the pilot's ejector seat if the aft ejector seat was fired first. The F-4B aircraft {{were in the process of}} being modified with a newly designed canopy when the collision occurred. Aircraft based at MCAS El Toro were slated to begin upgrades in July 1971; at the time of the collision, BuNo 151458 was still operating with the original canopy configuration, and the pilot was consequently unable to eject from the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{entirety}} of Pacific City may be explored {{from the start}} of the game, allowing the player to locate the hideouts of each General and Kingpin, which can be made easier by accessing supply points scattered around the city. Once a supply point is <b>unlocked,</b> <b>the</b> player has the option of returning there to travel to any other supply point, restock on weapons and ammunition, or drop off newly acquired weapons, to permanently add them to their weapon selection. Should the player die, they can respawn at any open supply point. While exploring, the player is likely to come across enemy resistance, with their aggressiveness based on how badly the player has damaged that particular gang recently. If the player is too aggressive against the non-gang residents of Pacific City, including the Peacekeepers, they are flagged as rogue, and Agency hit squads are dispatched to take them down.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{games in}} the series also have {{compatibility}} with other games, such as in Revenge, where players can <b>unlock</b> <b>the</b> Madden Challenge Bus by having a save file from Madden NFL 06, and a Burnout 3: Takedown save file <b>unlocks</b> <b>the</b> Dominator Assassin.|$|R

5|$|The game also {{features}} various Bonus Challenges. When Cooper collects five Rare books (there are 100 Rare books in total) during his adventure in Ghoulhaven Hall, a Bonus Challenge is <b>unlocked.</b> <b>The</b> main {{objective of the}} Bonus challenges is to revisit {{one of the rooms}} and perform a different task within it, such as defeating a number of enemies in a certain amount or time or surviving a duel with the Grim Reaper. Upon completing a Bonus Challenge, the player is awarded with a bronze, silver, gold or platinum medal based on their performance. For every platinum medal earned, a piece of the game's concept art is unlocked. If the player collects all 100 Rare books and earns gold or better on all 20 challenges, the player is given the option to reset the game with Amber unlocked as the new playable character in a 21st bonus challenge. Here Amber has 10 health in every level and there are no power ups. When the game is beaten this way the old E3 trailer for the game as well as a deleted cutscene are unlocked to view.|$|E
5|$|The game {{keeps track}} of the player's {{completed}} percentage of the storyline, increased by viewing the scenarios comprising each Episode. If 100% {{of the game is}} completed, an additional ending will be <b>unlocked.</b> <b>The</b> game features a fork in its plot, allowing the player to make a choice that changes what scenes they see and the number of percentage points they acquire afterward. It is impossible to see all of the game's content on a single playthrough, due to this fork in the storyline, although it is possible to achieve 100% storyline completion in a single playthrough. However, a 100% storyline completion can only be achieved through one of the two possible storylines. When the game is completed for the first time, it unlocks a New Game Plus option that allows the player to restart the game with all of the items, Garment Grids, dresspheres and storyline completion percentage achieved previously. However, all character levels are set back to one.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} {{navigate}} {{and interact with}} the game's environment, mainly carriages on the Orient Express, through use of a context-sensitive cursor. The cursor changes when it is placed over an item with which the player can interact, {{and can be used}} to talk to other characters, listen to other characters' conversations, look around the environment, and move. The player can walk to a location with a single click, and run to a location with a double-click. Double-clicking {{on the edge of the}} screen instantly takes the player to the next screen. There is a map of the train in the game's interface at the top of the screen, and once each carriage has been <b>unlocked,</b> <b>the</b> player can click on any part of the map and instantly be transported to that location, saving the player from having to travel through the train screen by screen. Another accessible feature is an objectives menu interface which states the general tasks the player should be attempting to complete. This menu is designed to guide players in the right direction without giving any explicit hints.|$|E
50|$|Under the {{proposed}} legislation, wireless service providers may still employ such locks on customer phones while under contract, {{so it is}} unlikely to impact the common practice of offering subsidized phones on contracts.As per the Wireless code F1: Unlocking: A service provider that provides a locked device to the customer as part of a contract must for subsidized devices: <b>unlock</b> <b>the</b> device, or give the customer <b>the</b> means to <b>unlock</b> <b>the</b> device, upon request, at the rate specified by the service provider, no later than 90 calendar days after the contract start date.

5|$|The {{uprising}} {{was launched}} {{on the hot}} summer day of 2 August 1943 (Monday, a regular day of rest from gassing), {{when a group of}} Germans and 40 Ukrainians drove off to the River Bug to swim. The conspirators silently <b>unlocked</b> <b>the</b> door to the arsenal near the train tracks, with a key that had been duplicated earlier. They had stolen 20–25 rifles, 20 hand grenades, and several pistols, and delivered them in a cart to the gravel work detail. At 3:45p.m., 700 Jews launched an insurgency that lasted for 30 minutes. They set buildings ablaze, exploded a tank of petrol, and set fire to the surrounding structures. A group of armed Jews attacked the main gate, and others attempted to climb the fence. Machine-gun fire from about 25 Germans and 60 Ukrainian Trawnikis resulted in near-total slaughter. Lajcher was killed along with most of the insurgents. About 200 Jews escaped from the camp. Half of them were killed after a chase in cars and on horses. The Jews did not cut the phone wires, and Stangl called in hundreds of German reinforcements, who arrived from four different towns and set up roadblocks along the way. Partisans of the Armia Krajowa (Polish: Home Army) transported some of the surviving escapees across the river and others like Sperling ran 30 kilometres (19 miles) and were then helped and fed by Polish villagers. Of those who broke through, around 70 are known to have survived {{until the end of the}} war, including the future authors of published Treblinka memoirs: Richard Glazar, Chil Rajchman, Jankiel Wiernik, and Samuel Willenberg.|$|E
5|$|In February, Benfica's {{schedule}} {{included two}} difficult away matches against Porto and Sporting. They began the month with the semi-final of the 2008–09 Taça da Liga against Vitória de Guimarães. Benfica scored the opening goal on a Carlos Martins corner kick which Grégory headed {{into his own}} net. Near the end of regulation time, Pablo Aimar added the second (his first for the club), and Guimarães responded with a consolation goal. Four days later, Benfica played Porto at the Estádio do Dragão in a game between the top two teams on the league table. They scored first through Hassan Yebda, who headed in a corner kick from José Antonio Reyes. In the second half, Benfica held Porto until the 72th minute, when Pedro Proença signalled a controversial penalty by Yebda on Lisandro López. Lucho González converted it for a 1–1 draw. Sánchez Flores was satisfied, because the club played well and controlled the game. The result kept Porto {{on top of the}} league table by one point. On 15 February, Benfica hosted Paços de Ferreira. The scoring came in the second half – the first goal in the 69th minute, when Aimar assisted Óscar Cardozo. Four minutes later, Rúben Amorim made it 2–0, with Paços reacting immediately with the 2–1 from Ferreira. Near the end, Di María scored the third goal for Benfica, with Paços cutting their lead to 3–2 and then hitting the post. Sánchez Flores called it a hard-fought win, with his players' commitment keeping Porto at bay. Almost a week later, Benfica visited the Estádio José Alvalade to face Sporting. An 11th-minute opener from Liédson was answered with an equaliser from Reyes before half-time. In the second half, Derlei <b>unlocked</b> <b>the</b> draw, scoring Sporting's second goal before Liédson scored a third; Cardozo brought it down to 3–2, and the clock ran out three minutes later. Benfica's second league loss had troubling consequences; Sporting was tied for second place with 37 points, and Porto had a four-point lead. The club finished February with a home win against Leixões. Élvis opened with an own goal for Benfica. Nuno Gomes later scored the second (his fifth goal of the season), with Leixões replying with a goal of their own. Despite playing with ten men, Benfica held Leixões back and won. To Sánchez Flores, the match was intense and difficult, but the victory put pressure on their opponents (who faced each other in following day). With a goalless draw in the game between Porto and Sporting, Benfica finished February with 40 points, two fewer than Porto.|$|E
