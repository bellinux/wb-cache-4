5|$|Monument 14 is an eroded Olmec-style {{sculpture}} {{dating to}} the Middle Preclassic. It represents a squatting human figure, possibly female, wearing a headdress and earspools. <b>Under</b> <b>one</b> <b>arm</b> it grips a jaguar cub, under the other it carries a fawn.|$|E
5|$|Stela 4 is {{dated to}} AD 396, {{during the reign}} of Yax Nuun Ayiin after the {{intrusion}} of Teotihuacan in the Maya area. The stela displays a mix of Maya and Teotihuacan qualities, and deities from both cultures. It has a portrait of the king with the Underworld Jaguar God <b>under</b> <b>one</b> <b>arm</b> and the Mexican Tlaloc under the other. His helmet is a simplified version of the Teotihuacan War Serpent. Unusually for Maya sculpture, but typically for Teotihuacan, Yax Nuun Ayiin is depicted with a frontal face, rather than in profile.|$|E

50|$|In Western Europe {{there were}} two common forms of distaffs, {{depending}} on the spinning method. The traditional form is a staff, held <b>under</b> <b>one's</b> <b>arm</b> while using a spindle. It is about 3 ft long, held under the left arm, with the left hand drawing the fibers from it. This version is the older of the two, as spindle spinning predates spinning on a wheel.|$|R

5000|$|Strut {{holsters}} {{are used}} exclusively for concealed carry. They are worn above the trouser belt line as a cross draw holster located directly <b>under</b> <b>one's</b> <b>arm</b> (9 o'clock position) or {{toward the front}} of the body (10 to 11 o'clock position). The design contains a strut which is shaped to nest behind one's trouser belt and attach to the holster at the other end. The strut transfers the weight of the firearm to the belt and retains the weapon in place for secure removal. A flexible band is also attached to the holster and worn above the waist to keep the weapon snug against the body. Concealment is achieved by wearing the unit inside of a shirt which may be tucked in or worn outside.|$|R

2500|$|As time passed, Disney {{feared that}} Mintz would forgo {{renewal of the}} contract, partly due to Iwerks informing Disney that George Winkler, {{at the behest of}} Mintz, had been going behind Disney's back during pick-up runs for Oswald reels and hiring away his animators. Eventually, Walt {{traveled}} with his wife Lilly to New York to shop the series to other distributors, including Fox and MGM, prior to meetings with Mintz. As Walt later recalled, he placed two Oswald prints <b>under</b> <b>one</b> <b>arm</b> and—feeling [...] "like a hick"—marched [...] "one half-block north" [...] on Broadway to MGM to visit Fred Quimby. During this period, Walt and Lillian attended the premier of the Oswald short Rival Romeos, which debuted at the Colony on 53rd and Broadway.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 October 1731, fire {{broke out}} in Ashburnham House, and many manuscripts were lost, while others were badly singed or water-damaged: up to {{a quarter of the}} {{collection}} was either destroyed or damaged. Bentley escaped while clutching the priceless Codex Alexandrinus <b>under</b> <b>one</b> <b>arm,</b> a scene witnessed and later described in a letter to Charlotte, Lady Sundon, by Robert Freind, headmaster of Westminster School. The manuscript of The Battle of Maldon was destroyed, and that of Beowulf was heavily damaged. Also severely damaged was the Byzantine Cotton Genesis, the illustrations of which nevertheless remain an important record of Late Antique iconography. Mr. Speaker Onslow, as one of the statutory trustees of the library, directed and personally supervised a remarkable programme of restoration within the resources of his time. [...] The published report of this work is of major importance in bibliography. Fortunately, copies had been made of some, but by no means all, of those works that were lost, and many of those damaged could be restored in the nineteenth century.|$|E
2500|$|Hoskins {{refused to}} allow his wound to force his {{premature}} exit from the Navy, asserting his fitness to visiting friend Admiral William Halsey: [...] "... the Navy doesn't expect a man to think with his feet. That blast didn't knock off my head." [...] Recovering in the Naval Hospital Philadelphia, Hoskins's rank allowed him to choose the location of his hospital bed, which he selected for its view of the naval shipyard where the next [...] was being laid down. While rehabilitating, he received both the Purple Heart and Navy Cross for his actions aboard Princeton. Fitted with a prosthetic foot, Hoskins started a vigorous exercise program, including paying visits to the shipyard to oversee construction of the new Essex-class carrier. When Princeton was commissioned in November 1945, Hoskins became her first commanding officer. A year later, {{he was promoted to}} rear admiral and given command of Carrier Division Seventeen. Air Group 81, formerly from Princeton, asked Walt Disney to design a mascot patch, [...] "a saber-slinging pirate with an aircraft carrier <b>under</b> <b>one</b> <b>arm</b> and a peg leg firing ammunition like a machine gun", and were for a time known as Peg-Leg Petes.|$|E

2500|$|The matchlock firing {{mechanism}} {{became a}} common {{term for the}} arquebus after it {{was added to the}} firearm. Prior to the appearance of the matchlock, handguns were fired from the chest, tucked <b>under</b> <b>one</b> <b>arm,</b> while the other arm maneuvered a hot pricker to the touch hole to ignite the gunpowder. The matchlock changed this by adding a firing mechanism consisting of two parts, the match, and the lock. The lock mechanism held within a clamp a two to three feet long length of smoldering rope soaked in saltpeter, which was the match. Connected to the lock lever was a trigger, which lowered the match into a priming pan when pulled, igniting the priming powder, causing a flash to travel through the touch hole, also igniting the gunpowder within the barrel, and propelling the bullet out the muzzle. While matchlocks provided a crucial advantage by allowing the user to aim the firearm using both hands, it was also awkward to utilize. To avoid accidentally igniting the gunpowder the match had to be detached while loading the gun. In some instances the match would also go out, so both ends of the match were kept lit. This proved cumbersome to maneuver as both hands were required to hold the match during removal, one end in each hand. The procedure was so complex that a 1607 drill manual published by Jacob de Gheyn in the Netherlands listed 28 steps just to fire and load the gun. In 1584 the Ming general Qi Jiguang composed an 11 step song to practice the procedure in rhythm: [...] "One, clean the gun. Two pour the powder. Three tamp the powder down. Four drop the pellet. Five drive the pellet down. Six put in paper (stopper). Seven drive the paper down. Eight open the flashpan cover. Nine pour in the flash powder. Ten close the flashpan, and clamp the fuse. Eleven, listen for the signal, then open the flashpan cover. Aiming at the enemy, raise your gun and fire." [...] Reloading a gun during the 16th century took anywhere from between 20 seconds to a minute under the most ideal conditions.|$|E

50|$|This move is {{also known}} as a wind-up slam. To perform it, the wrestler faces the {{opponent}} and reaches between the opponent's legs with <b>one</b> <b>arm</b> and around the back from the same side with the other arm. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up so they are horizontal across the wrestler's body. Next, the wrestler spins in a circle while swinging {{the lower half of the}} opponent's body out and around until <b>one</b> <b>arm</b> is across the opponent's chest and <b>under</b> <b>one</b> or both <b>arms.</b> The wrestler then falls forward, slamming the opponent into the mat back-first. In some variations of the move, the wrestler can hold the opponent up over their shoulder and throw the opponent round from that position, or hang the opponent across both their shoulders and throw out their legs behind them so the opponent swings back round to drop in a position. This move is used by Abyss as the Black Hole Slam. A sitout variant is used by Big Cass as the East River Crossing.|$|R

40|$|P-values, {{survival}} {{analyses and}} phase II trials Sir- The paper on chemotherapy of salivary gland tumours by Jones et al. (1993), recently published in BJC, is very misleading. In particular, the author's comparisons of survival are of dubious value and show a complete {{misunderstanding of the}} role of P-values {{in the context of a}} phase II trial which was terminated after the first phase. Also, while it was commendable to use randomisation in a phase II trial, the early termination means that in the event the randomisation (of 16 patients) became worthless, contrary to the impression given in this paper. The authors report a median survival of 243 days <b>under</b> <b>one</b> treatment <b>arm,</b> as compared with 450 days in the other group. This is an astonishingly large difference, being almost a doubling of the survival time, from 8 months to 15 months...|$|R

50|$|Also {{known as}} a half Boston crab or a half crab, a move that {{typically}} starts with the opponent on their back, and the attacking wrestler standing and facing them. The attacking wrestler hooks one of the opponent's legs <b>under</b> <b>one</b> of their <b>arms,</b> and then turns the opponent face-down, stepping over them in the process. The final position has the dominant wrestler in a semi-sitting position and facing away from the opponent who is lying face-down and their own leg bent backwards toward their head. A variation with the attacking wrestler kneeling side-ways while having the leg hooked can be performed. Lance Storm used this maneuver as a counter to an oncoming opponent by grabbing one of the opponent's legs in a single leg takedown and using the momentum to roll backwards into the hold.|$|R
