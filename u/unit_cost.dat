40|$|AbstractObjectivesMany {{economic}} evaluations {{are conducted}} {{in the fields of}} oncology and hematology, partially owing to the introduction of new expensive drugs in this field. Even though inpatient days, outpatient visits, and daycare treatments are frequently the main drivers of total treatment <b>costs,</b> their <b>unit</b> <b>costs</b> often lack generalizability. Therefore, we aimed to determine the <b>unit</b> <b>costs</b> of inpatient hospital days, outpatient visits, and daycare treatments specifically for oncological and hematological diseases in The Netherlands from the hospital's perspective. MethodsUnit costs were collected from 30 oncological and hematological departments of 6 university and 24 general hospitals. Costs included direct labor and indirect labor, hotel and nutrition, overheads and capital. Ordinary least squares regression models were constructed to examine the degree of association between <b>unit</b> <b>costs</b> and hospital and hospital department characteristics. All costs were based on Euro 2007 cost data. ResultsAt university hospitals, the <b>unit</b> <b>costs</b> per inpatient day were determined at € 633 in oncological and € 680 in hematological departments. At general hospitals, the mean costs per inpatient day were € 400. <b>Unit</b> <b>costs</b> for inpatient hospital days, outpatient visits. and daycare treatments equalled the relative ratio 100 : 21 : 44. Direct labor costs were the major cost driver and the type of hospital (university, yes/no) was a strong predictor of <b>unit</b> <b>costs.</b> ConclusionsThe present study provided <b>unit</b> <b>costs</b> for inpatient hospital days, outpatient visits, and daycare treatments in the fields of oncology and hematology.

5|$|Integer sorting {{algorithms}} {{are usually}} {{designed to work}} in either the pointer machine or random access machine models of computing. The main {{difference between these two}} models is in how memory may be addressed. The random access machine allows any value that is stored in a register to be used as the address of memory read and write operations, with <b>unit</b> <b>cost</b> per operation. This ability allows certain complex operations on data to be implemented quickly using table lookups. In contrast, in the pointer machine model, read and write operations use addresses stored in pointers, and it is not allowed to perform arithmetic operations on these pointers. In both models, data values may be added, and bitwise Boolean operations and binary shift operations may typically also be performed on them, in unit time per operation. Different integer sorting algorithms make different assumptions, however, about whether integer multiplication is also allowed as a unit-time operation. Other more specialized models of computation such as the parallel random access machine have also been considered.|$|E
5|$|The {{arguments}} {{that led to}} the cancellation of the B-70 program had led some to question the need for a new strategic bomber of any sort. The USAF was adamant about retaining bombers as part of the nuclear triad concept that included bombers, ICBMs, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) in a combined package that complicated any potential defense. They argued that the bomber was needed to attack hardened military targets and to provide a safe counterforce option because the bombers could be quickly launched into safe loitering areas where they could not be attacked. However, the introduction of the SLBM made moot the mobility and survivability argument, and a newer generation of ICBMs, such as the Minuteman III, had the accuracy and speed needed to attack point targets. During this time, ICBMs were seen as a less costly option based on their lower <b>unit</b> <b>cost,</b> but development costs were much higher. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara preferred ICBMs over bombers for the Air Force portion of the deterrent force and felt a new expensive bomber was not needed. McNamara limited the AMSA program to studies and component development beginning in 1964.|$|E
5|$|On 15 January 2014, a {{spending}} bill {{passed by the}} House appropriated $100 million for the GCV program, even though the Army had requested $592 million for the program for FY 2014. The Army planned to spend 80 percent of its ground vehicle modernization budget on the GCV over the next 5 years, with costs ranging from $29-$34 billion depending on overruns and setbacks. Several options were being considered to make the program more affordable, including reducing the squad size from their optimum goal of nine men and using new emerging, and undeveloped, technologies to reduce {{the weight of the}} vehicle to 30 tons for operations in urban environments. The two contractors would run out of money for development of their prototype vehicles by June 2014 unless the Army funded the rest of the technology development phase. The Pentagon and Army tried to find ways to continue the program, without actually starting vehicle production, through new technologies like advanced fire control systems and hybrid engines. Although the Army wanted 1,894 Ground Combat Vehicles with a target price of $9–10.5 million per unit, the Pentagon's Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation estimated a <b>unit</b> <b>cost</b> of up to $17 million. The 83-percent cut in funding essentially scaled back the GCV program to a research effort. The program had declined in support over the past months with the Army determining that the desired vehicle was no longer feasible in the near term due to budget reductions, suspicion from the contractors that the program would not move past technology development, and Congress's believing it would not succeed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Economic {{theory and}} limited {{empirical}} {{data suggest that}} <b>costs</b> per <b>unit</b> of HIV prevention program output (<b>unit</b> <b>costs)</b> will initially decrease as small programs expand. <b>Unit</b> <b>costs</b> may then reach a nadir and start to increase if expansion continues beyond the economically optimal size. Information {{on the relationship between}} scale and <b>unit</b> <b>costs</b> is critical to project the cost of global HIV prevention efforts and to allocate prevention resources efficiently. Methods The "Prevent AIDS: Network for Cost-Effectiveness Analysis" (PANCEA) project collected 2003 and 2004 cost and output data from 206 HIV prevention programs of six types in five countries. The association between scale and efficiency for each intervention type was examined for each country. Our team characterized the direction, shape, and strength of this association by fitting bivariate regression lines to scatter plots of output levels and <b>unit</b> <b>costs.</b> We chose the regression forms with the highest explanatory power (R 2). Results Efficiency increased with scale, across all countries and interventions. This association varied within intervention and within country, in terms of the range in scale and efficiency, the best fitting regression form, and the slope of the regression. The fraction of variation in efficiency explained by scale ranged from 26 % – 96 %. Doubling in scale resulted in reductions in <b>unit</b> <b>costs</b> averaging 34. 2 % (ranging from 2. 4 % to 58. 0 %). Two regression trends, in India, suggested an inflection point beyond which <b>unit</b> <b>costs</b> increased. Conclusion <b>Unit</b> <b>costs</b> decrease with scale across a wide range of service types and volumes. These country and intervention-specific findings can inform projections of the global cost of scaling up HIV prevention efforts. </p...|$|R

40|$|This note {{shows that}} <b>unit</b> labor <b>costs,</b> {{the most widely}} used measure of competitiveness, are {{equivalent}} to the labor share in output multiplied by a price-adjustment factor. This has three main implications. First, <b>unit</b> labor <b>costs</b> are not just a technical concept. They embody the social relations and institutional arrangements that influence the distribution of income between the social classes. Secondly, lower <b>unit</b> labor <b>costs</b> should not necessarily be interpreted as implying that an economy is more competitive, i. e., that it will grow faster, and vice-versa. An increase in the wage share can accelerate growth through a number of channels. Hence, it is possible to find that countries with fast-growing <b>unit</b> labor <b>costs</b> also show faster growth in exports or in gross domestic product (GDP). Third, one can define the concept of <b>unit</b> capital <b>cost</b> as a measure of competitiveness and shift the burden of lack of growth or loss of market share to capital. In this paper, unit labor and <b>unit</b> capital <b>costs</b> for the Philippines are calculated. It is shown that the decrease in competitiveness (i. e., increase in <b>unit</b> labor <b>costs)</b> in the Philippines is exclusively the result of increases in prices as the labor share has decreased. competitiveness, Philippines, <b>unit</b> labor <b>costs,</b> <b>unit</b> capital <b>cost...</b>|$|R
