60|$|I {{will now}} begin my tale. It is above thirty years since I {{commenced}} my agitation in Britannula. We were a small people, {{and had not}} then been blessed by separation; but we were, I think, peculiarly intelligent. We were the very cream, as it were, that had been skimmed from the milk-pail {{of the people of}} a wider colony, themselves gifted with more than ordinary intelligence. We were the élite of the selected population of New Zealand. I think I may say that no race so well informed ever before set itself down to form a new nation. I am now nearly sixty years old,--very nearly fit for the college which, alas! will never be open for me,--and I was nearly thirty when I began to be in earnest as to the Fixed Period. At that time my dearest friend and most trusted coadjutor was Gabriel Crasweller. He was ten years my senior then, and is now therefore fit for deposition in the college were the college there to receive him. He {{was one of those who}} brought with them merino sheep into the colony. At great labour and expense he exported from New Zealand a small flock of choice animals, with which he was successful from the first. He took possession of the lands of Little Christchurch, five or six miles from Gladstonopolis, and showed great judgment in the selection. A prettier spot, as it turned out, for the fattening of both beef and mutton and for the growth of wool, it would have been impossible to have found. Everything that human nature wants was there at Little Christchurch. The streams which watered the land were bright and rapid, and always running. The grasses were peculiarly rich, and the old English fruit-trees, which we had brought with <b>us</b> <b>from</b> <b>New</b> Zealand, throve there with an exuberant fertility, of which the mother country, I am told, knows nothing. He had imported pheasants' eggs, and salmon-spawn, and young deer, and black-cock and grouse, and those beautiful little Alderney cows no bigger than good-sized dogs, which, when milked, give nothing but cream. All these things throve with him uncommonly, so that it may be declared of him that his lines had fallen in pleasant places. But he had no son; and therefore in discussing with him, as I did daily, the question of the Fixed Period, I promised him that it should be my lot to deposit him in the sacred college when the day of his withdrawal should have come. He had been married before we left New Zealand, and was childless when he made for himself and his wife his homestead at Little Christchurch. But there, after a few years, a daughter was born to him, and I ought to have remembered, when I promised to him that last act of friendship, that it might become the duty of that child's husband to do for him with filial reverence the loving work which I had undertaken to perform.|$|E

5000|$|The central stoneroller is {{widespread}} in freshwater streams throughout {{a large portion}} of the eastern, central, and midwestern United States.

However, it is a very tolerant species and can be found in almost any stream system with adequate food, leading to it widespread distribution.|$|E

40|$|As any {{literary}} text, {{a dramatic}} text {{can be translated}} {{in a range of}} endless and equivalent stagings. Therefore, a comparative analysis of different performances of the same play can reveal its latent potentialities and show it to <b>us</b> <b>from</b> <b>new</b> perspectives, as many as the analysed performances, and all of them would be valid. This is what we intend to do through this work, by comparing two different stagings of  Waiting for Godot : the first one by Lorenzo Loris, director of the troupe of the Theatre Out Off, from Milan (2009 / 2010); the second one is directed by Francesco Saponaro in the Theatre Mercadante, in Naples. Thanks to some useful tools like the DVD recordings of both shows and the interviews kindly granted by the directors, we could start first analyzing the non-verbal elements of each show (most of all the sets), and then comparing the scripts. Finally, we could deduce from such analysis the translation project and the interpretation of each troupe, and find proofs of ours results in the interviews. </div...|$|E
