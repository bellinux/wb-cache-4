This {{has been a}}ccompanied by an increase in the level of community concern about possible health effects from the radio frequency (RF) radiation emissions from antennae mounted on the base station towers. This report presents field survey measurements data and provides information on the levels of RF radiation to which members of the public may be exposed from these base stations. The measured RF electromagnetic energy (EME) levels are compared with the maximum permitted limit for non-occupational exposure with respect to the Radiocommunications (Electromagnetic Radiation Human Exposure) Standard 1999 which specifies a maximum non-occupational exposure limit of 2) at relevant base station frequencies. Although the focus of the survey was on measuring the RF EME emission levels from the digital Global System for Mobile communication (GSM), the environmental RF EME measurement component of the project involved investigating the EME levels from other sources, including the analog Advance Mobile Phone Systems (AMPS), VHF TV, UHF TV, AM radio, FM radio and Paging. The results clearly demonstrate that the RF EME emissions from GSM base stations are several orders of magnitude below the maximum permitted limit. A worst case RF EME <b>power</b> <b>flux</b> <b>density</b> prediction, based on our measurements from GSM base stations, is 0. 178 limit of <b>power</b> <b>flux</b> <b>density</b> is at least 1, 000 times this predicted value).

40|$|This PhD study {{addresses}} {{the question of}} whether the environmental impact of renewable energy sources is related to the <b>power</b> <b>flux</b> <b>density.</b> The object was to examine whether there are some general rules concerning the environmental impact from renewable energy sources, and whether a common factor could be the <b>power</b> <b>flux</b> <b>density,</b> of unit kW/m 2 as an underlying principle. The background and nature of the study are described with definitions of key concepts. The role of energy in the environment, powering the natural world and having a set of functions, are explained. The need for a general theory and the rationale is considered for eight primary renewable energy sources. The literature on environmental impact from these sources is reviewed. The theory and the hypothesis are explained with questions raised. A test devised to explore the relevant interactions (sediment transport and land use) is outlined, using data from a selection of well known hydro electric power developments. The 'Stream Power' concept and a variety of parameters were used for identifying losses of energy and power to a river's natural processes, resulting from impoundment dams. The test was carried out on the reservoir reach and the river downstream. It is concluded from applying the hypothesis to hydro electric power, that the environmental impact may indeed be related to the <b>power</b> <b>flux</b> <b>density,</b> for the two main impact parameters investigated, land use and sediment transport, though this is not conclusively statistically confirmed due to the small sample size. The hypothesis is extended in the Appendix to the other water based renewable energy sources, tidal barrage, marine current, and wave power, and to the lower energy <b>flux</b> <b>density</b> sources such as wind, solar and biomass. It is concluded tentatively that there is a qualitative argument that the environmental impact of all renewable energy sources may be related to <b>power</b> <b>flux</b> <b>density,</b> in terms of both land use and some functions in nature of the energy flow.

For generation of deuterium plasma and fast deuterons, plasma-focus devices PF- 12 and PF- 1000 are used. Depending on devices and conditions, the <b>power</b> <b>flux</b> <b>density</b> of plasma varied {{in a range of}} 107 - 1010 W/cm 2 with pulse duration of 50 - 100 ns. <b>Power</b> <b>flux</b> <b>density</b> of fast ions was 1010 - 1012 W/cm 2 at the pulse duration of 10 - 50 ns. To achieve the combined effect of different kind of plasmas, the samples were later irradiated with hydrogen plasma (105 W/cm 2, 0. 25 ms) by a QSPA Kh- 50 plasma generator. Surface modification was analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and microroughness measurements. For estimation of damages in the bulk of material, an electrical conductivity method was used. Investigations showed that irradiation of DFW with multiple plasma pulses generated a mesh of micro- and macrocracks due to high heat load. A comparison with single forged tungsten (W) and tungsten doped with 1 % lanthanum-oxide (WL 10) reveals the better crack-resistance of DFW. Also, sizes of cells formed between the cracks on the DFW’s surface were larger than in cases of W or WL 10. Measurements of electrical conductivity indicated a layer of decreased conductivity, which reached up to 500 μm. It depended mainly on values of <b>power</b> <b>flux</b> <b>density</b> of fast ions, but not on the number of pulses.
