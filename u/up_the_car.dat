5|$|Ole Ewé, {{a former}} member of BOPA—another group in the Danish {{resistance}} movement—disagreed with the description of the attempt to kill the Gestapo leader Hoffman on the Roskildevej road. In the film, the car had Nazi flags, and a soldier and his son are killed by resistance gunfire. Ewé said that on that day he and other BOPA members were enlisted to kill Arno Oskar Hammeken, a Gestapo informer. Flammen, who also received tips about the informer's whereabouts, appeared there and shot <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Ewé said that the man in the car was in civilian clothes and there were no Nazi flags on the car.|$|E
5|$|During {{a grocery}} {{shopping}} trip, Lois realizes she is short on {{money to pay}} for food. She pretends to return a ham to the meat department but decides to hide it in her purse instead. Hooked on the thrill of shoplifting, she begins stealing other items, quickly becoming addicted to theft. She begins to indulge in large shoplifting sprees, including stealing a Matisse painting, which arouses the suspicion of Brian. While attempting to steal from an auto parts store, Lois is caught by Brian, who tells her she is doing wrong and that her stealing is not going to solve problems. Lois accepts his reasoning, but as she loads <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> to return her stolen goods, she is caught by Joe and arrested.|$|E
5|$|The bear follows {{and climbs}} {{on top of}} the Jeep, smashing <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and {{eventually}} overturning it before leaving as the sun sets. Sean wakes up and tells them about the hunting paraphernalia, crying about wanting to go home before he dies. Wes and Lauren turn the Jeep right side up, load him back in the car, then push the Jeep down the hilly road as a thunderstorm hits. Using the downward momentum and occasionally pushing, they arrive near the buildings. While Lauren is exploring the building with the trap, the bear swings at her through a window sending her back against the trap, which impales her back. She returns to the vehicle where the bear rips off the tailgate and drags away Sean's body.|$|E

50|$|Most {{railways}} are {{regional and}} do not own track {{all the way across}} the nation, so their lines end at some point. Since the late 19th century, many railways have chosen to end their lines near Peoria, Illinois. When a train <b>car</b> reaches <b>the</b> end of one rail line, it must be switched to a different line in order to continue on to its destination. P&PU engines are responsible for picking <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> at <b>the</b> end of other railways' lines and bringing them back to the main yard in East Peoria. Employees then sort <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> based on which railway will take them to their next stop. After these new trains have been formed, P&PU engines take <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> to <b>the</b> beginning of that rail line where they will continue their journey. That company's engines then pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> and take them to their destination.|$|R
25|$|After the race, {{his father}} {{wanted to sell}} the car since it was worth a lot of money. The two reached an {{agreement}} where the father would gradually be paid for the car if the newly graduated Scott Bloomquist would work at his father's new farm far {{across the country in}} Tennessee. He traded his 1957 Chevy for a truck and race hauler. After arriving in Tennessee, he tore <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> in qualifying at Newport Speedway. He worked for his father until he had enough money to repair the car. He won some races, earning just enough money to continue racing.|$|E
25|$|Day three saw Toyota {{drop down}} {{from taking the}} fastest times to take the fifth fastest time on a {{moderately}} damp track. Felipe Massa was the fastest man on the track after 87 laps of the British circuit testing various aerodynamic and mechanical adjustments to the car. Although delayed through an oil system problem Alonso finished off aerodynamics work and continued to set <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> for the coming British Grand Prix, finishing with a time slower than second placed Williams driver Nico Rosberg. The leading GP2 driver Timo Glock took to the circuit with BMW Sauber up against ex-rival Nelson Piquet Jr. who was driving with Renault. Piquet Jr. made the fourth fastest time, more than a second faster than Glock.|$|E
25|$|Damages may be {{general or}} consequential. General damages are those damages which {{naturally}} flow from {{a breach of}} contract. Consequential damages are those damages which, although not naturally flowing from a breach, are naturally supposed by both parties {{at the time of}} contract formation. An example would be when someone rents a car to get to a business meeting, but when that person arrives to pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> it is not there. General damages would be the cost of renting a different car. Consequential damages would be the lost business if that person was unable to get to the meeting, if both parties knew the reason the party was renting the car. However, there is still a duty to mitigate the losses. The fact that the car was not there does not give the party a right to not attempt to rent another car.|$|E

500|$|... "I Stay in Love" [...] was {{released}} as {{the fourth and}} final single from the album on October 28, 2008. The song failed to chart on the Hot 100, though became Carey's fourteenth chart topper on the Hot Dance Club Play. Additionally, it peaked at number ninety-five on the UK Singles Chart. The song's accompanying music video was filmed by Carey's husband, Nick Cannon, and features Carey as a dancer in a Las Vegas show at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino Resort.

500|$|From the beginning, Regency Square was a prestigious, high-class development, and it {{is still}} {{considered}} to be [...] "one of Brighton's best sea-facing squares". By the mid-20th century, most of the houses had become hotels, and in early 1969 a surface-level car park was planned for the Brighton Corporation owned central garden; this was changed to a 520-space underground car park which was created using the cut and cover method in which the garden was dug <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> park with roof constructed, and the lawns and flowerbeds restored. [...] Richard Seifert's , Modernist 24-storey residential block, Sussex Heights, was built in 1968 on land immediately to the east of the square, and was criticised for affecting the character of the square because of its contrasting style and height. During the early 1970s the hotels sought permission from Brighton Corporation to erect neon signs advertising themselves; after negotiation with the Regency Society, a Brighton-wide conservation group formed in 1945, the Corporation made the square and the surrounding area into a conservation area in 1973. [...] Conservation area status gives the council firmer control over planning permission and changes to buildings or street furniture, especially in respect of their effect on [...] "the character and appearance of the area". The original conservation area has since been enlarged twice to its present size of [...]|$|E

2500|$|Both {{railroads and}} {{automakers}} wanted to eliminate theft and damage from vandalism and weather, thus reducing shipping costs. They {{also wanted to}} increase the number of vehicles carried per rail car for the same reason. Toward that end, in 1968 General Motors and the Southern Pacific Railroad jointly began work on development of a radical new rail car designed to carry the Chevrolet Vega, a new compact car being developed by GM. Known as [...] "Vert-A-Pac", the rail cars would hold 30 Vegas in a vertical, nose-down position, versus 18 in normal tri-level autoracks. Each Vega was fitted with four removable, cast-steel sockets inserted into the undercarriage that locked into the hooks on the bottom-hinged doors that made <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> side.|$|E
2500|$|With 28 laps to go, Ryan Newman {{lost the}} lead to Joey Logano and he held off a hard-charging Kyle Larson to score his fifth win of the season. “It was a crazy race, and I had such a fast Pennzoil Ford," [...] said Logano. [...] "It is awesome {{to be back in}} victory lane. When the top opened <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> just took off. Me and the No. 42 (Kyle Larson) were the only ones that seemed to be able to run up there. We had a cat and mouse (with Larson) during {{portions}} of the late run. I just {{had to be able to}} work the traffic and keep my momentum up. We just have to keep capitalizing going forward.” ...|$|E
2500|$|When Chief Stewart later {{arrived at}} the Coacci home, Coacci was missing but they found Buda. When he was questioned, Buda said that Coacci owned a [...]32 Savage {{automatic}} pistol, which he kept in the kitchen. A search of the kitchen did not locate the gun, but Stewart found a manufacturer's technical diagram for a Model 1907 [...]32 Savage automatic pistol – the exact pistol type and caliber used to shoot Parmenter and Berardelli – in a kitchen drawer. Stewart asked Buda if he owned a gun, and the man produced a [...]32-caliber Spanish-made automatic pistol. Buda told police that he owned a 1914 Overland automobile, which was being repaired. The car was delivered for repairs {{four days after the}} Braintree crimes, but it was old and apparently had not been run for five months. Tire tracks were seen near the abandoned Buick getaway car, and Chief Stewart surmised that two cars had been used in the getaway, and that Buda's car might have been the second car. The garage proprietor who was repairing Buda's vehicle was instructed to call the police if anyone came to pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E

50|$|The crew {{departed}} Mojave {{at approximately}} 12:15 a.m. on May 12, and headed south (railroad direction east) approximately three miles to Fleta, {{where they were}} to pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> 69 freight <b>cars.</b> Due to maintenance equipment being parked on the track {{at the south end}} of the Fleta siding, it was necessary for the train crew to pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> from <b>the</b> north end, take them back to Mojave and run around them, before heading south to Palmdale, where it was originally intended to pick up an additional helper that would be placed on the rear of the train to aid in braking after cresting Cajon Pass.|$|R
50|$|The typical {{facility}} for loading ships {{consists of a}} holding area and a system of conveyors for transferring the coal to dockside and loading it into the ship's cargo holds. Originally the holding area consisted of a rail yard in which <b>the</b> loaded <b>cars</b> were sorted by grade and held until needed for loading. Modern facilities {{are more likely to}} unload <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> immediately (say with rotary car dumpers) and store the coal in piles until the ship is loaded. This frees <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> for immediate reuse and obviates rail yard maintenance.|$|R
