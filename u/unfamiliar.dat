5|$|As a collegiate university, Oxford's {{structure}} can {{be confusing}} to those <b>unfamiliar</b> with it. The university is a federation, comprising over forty self-governing colleges and halls, {{along with a}} central administration headed by the Vice-Chancellor.|$|E
5|$|He {{was fond}} {{of the works of}} Akira Kurosawa, and worked in a {{reference}} to him in Paprika. However he claimed to be largely <b>unfamiliar</b> with Japanese film in general.|$|E
5|$|Other {{explanations}} are possible. Predators might innately fear <b>unfamiliar</b> forms (neophobia) {{long enough for}} them to become established, but this is likely to be only temporary.|$|E
5|$|A resupplied Prince of Wales {{set sail}} from Rio on Christmas Day 1788, {{completing}} an uneventful final leg to reach Falmouth in England on 25 March 1789. Despite the delays of disease, weather and an <b>unfamiliar</b> route, {{she was the}} first of the Fleet to return home, two months ahead of Alexander which did not reach England until 28 May.|$|E
5|$|Despite the limitations, Robinett {{was able}} to {{introduce}} concepts {{that at the time}} were <b>unfamiliar</b> to players. He had been able to construct different rooms in the games (thirty in the final version), in days where most games took place only on a single screen. Further, off-screen objects such as the bat would continue to move according to their programming behavior.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} two Tests, Brown {{struggled}} in his <b>unfamiliar</b> role, and he was dropped for the third. During the Third Test, opener Sid Barnes was injured, opening a vacancy for the Fourth Test at Headingley.|$|E
5|$|In feral sheep, rams may fight {{during the}} rut to {{determine}} which individuals may mate with ewes. Rams, especially <b>unfamiliar</b> ones, will also fight outside the breeding period to establish dominance; rams can kill one another if allowed to mix freely. During the rut, even usually friendly rams may become aggressive towards humans due to increases in their hormone levels.|$|E
5|$|Martin Glaessner {{proposed}} in The Dawn of Animal Life (1984) that the Ediacaran biota were recognizable crown group members of modern phyla, but were <b>unfamiliar</b> {{because they had}} yet to evolve the characteristic features we use in modern classification.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Portia have hunting tactics as {{versatile}} and adaptable as a lion's. All members of Portia have instinctive tactics for their most common prey, but can improvise {{by trial and error}} against <b>unfamiliar</b> prey or in <b>unfamiliar</b> situations, and then remember the new approach. They can also make detours to find the best attack angle against dangerous prey, even when the best detour takes a Portia out of visual contact with the prey, and sometimes the planned route leads to abseiling down a silk thread and biting the prey from behind. Such detours may take up to an hour, and a Portia usually picks the best route even if it needs to walk past an incorrect route. If a Portia makes a mistake while hunting another spider, it may itself be killed.|$|E
5|$|Peter {{wakes up}} wounded on a chaotic street in {{downtown}} New York City. He {{finds himself in}} <b>unfamiliar</b> territory, facing a plaque dedicated in 2021 {{to the victims of}} the September 11 attacks, and is quickly assisted by an officer of the militarized Fringe division.|$|E
5|$|Rush then {{engaged in}} a series of {{one-on-one}} matches with the scullers William Hickey, the Australian champion, and his brother Richard Hickey. Rush, being <b>unfamiliar</b> with rowing outrigger wager boats, on that occasion failed to win the championship from Hickey, but returned to the Lower Clarence with prize money totalling over £700.|$|E
5|$|Spectroscopic {{methods were}} {{predominantly}} used by physicists and astrophysicists. Spectroscopic techniques were rarely taught in chemistry classes and were <b>unfamiliar</b> to most practicing chemists. Beginning around 1904, Frank Twyman of the London instrument making firm Adam Hilger, Ltd. tried to develop spectroscopic instruments for chemists, but his customer base was consistently {{made up of}} physicists rather than chemists.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel is}} {{regarded}} as a landmark in hard science fiction. As is typical of the genre, Dragon's Egg attempts to communicate <b>unfamiliar</b> ideas and imaginative scenes while giving adequate attention to the known scientific principles involved.|$|E
5|$|These peculiarities may {{indicate}} that the artisan who designed the inscription was <b>unfamiliar</b> with runic writing, although {{perhaps some of the}} unusual letterforms may have been errors occasioned by the difficulty of inlaying wire to form runes.|$|E
5|$|This {{could of}} course have simply been {{a case of}} Smuts's diffidence and reserve re-asserting itself {{in the face of}} new and <b>unfamiliar</b> surrounding; however Smuts's biographers almost universally ascribe it to the poverty Smuts endured during this first year.|$|E
5|$|While {{serving with}} the Grand Fleet, Battleship Division Nine {{was forced to}} adapt quickly to <b>unfamiliar</b> British methods and standards. New signals and {{maneuvers}} were adopted relatively smoothly, while more stringent gunnery standards proved more difficult to achieve. On a personal level, relations between American and British officers and men were notably cordial.|$|E
5|$|Without human intervention, rams may fight {{during the}} rut to {{determine}} which individuals may mate with ewes. Rams, especially <b>unfamiliar</b> ones, will also fight outside the breeding period to establish dominance; rams can kill one another if allowed to mix freely. During the rut, even normally friendly rams may become aggressive towards humans due to increases in their hormone levels.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{opted to}} field an {{unchanged}} line-up for the Second Test at Lord's. Brown managed only 24 and 32 {{in the middle}} order as Australia won by 409 runs. Including the matches against Worcestershire and the MCC, he had totalled 123 runs at 24.60 in his five innings in the middle-order. O'Reilly criticised the selection of Brown, who was noticeably uncomfortable in the <b>unfamiliar</b> role. He said that although Brown had made an unbeaten double century on his previous Test at Lord's in 1938, Loxton and Harvey had better claims to selection.|$|E
5|$|Before Game of Thrones both Benioff and Weiss {{worked in}} film, and were <b>unfamiliar</b> with {{working on a}} {{television}} show. This resulted in several first-season episodes being about 10 minutes too short for HBO, forcing them to write another 100 pages of scripts in two weeks. Due to lack of budget the new scenes were designed to be inexpensive to film, such as two actors conversing in one room. Benioff and Weiss noted {{that some of their}} favorite scenes from the first season were the results of the dilemma, including one between Robert and Cersei Baratheon discussing their marriage.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{creation}} of the Canadian Heraldic Authority, Canadians wishing to obtain a legally granted coat of arms had to apply to one of the two heraldic offices in the United Kingdom: either the College of Arms in London or, if of Scottish descent, the Court of the Lord Lyon in Edinburgh. This process was quite lengthy—and costly. In addition, the heralds in Britain could sometimes be <b>unfamiliar</b> with Canadian history and symbols. In time, many Canadians with an interest in heraldry began calling for an office that would offer armorial bearings designed by and for Canadians.|$|E
5|$|Bradman rotated {{the three}} openers {{in the tour}} matches, but Morris and Barnes were {{preferred}} in the Tests. Bradman accommodated Brown in his first-choice team by playing him out of position in the middle order in the Tests. However, Brown appeared uncomfortable in the <b>unfamiliar</b> role, and was dropped after making 73 runs at a batting average of 24.33 {{in the first two}} Tests.|$|E
5|$|By 1976, {{after the}} city's {{residents}} had endured {{a spike in}} crime, overstressed public infrastructure, and an influx of people <b>unfamiliar</b> with Alaska customs, 56 percent said the pipeline had changed Fairbanks for the worse. In downtown Fairbanks, overcrowding, traffic problems, and drunken rambunctiousness caused by pipeline workers pushed businesses to move into malls built away from downtown. New commercial centers like Gavora Mall, Bentley Mall, and others {{away from the city}} center drove the construction of freeways that bypassed downtown Fairbanks.|$|E
5|$|By {{this point}} the Air Ministry was desperate to get any unit into service. Satisfied with his visit in May, Dowding {{suggested}} that the Mk. I {{was good enough for}} operational testing purposes. On 11 June 1939, AI was given the highest priority and provisions were made to supply 11 additional Blenheims to No 25 squadron at RAF Hawkinge (for a total of 21). Since each of the parts came from different suppliers, and the fitters were <b>unfamiliar</b> with any of it, members of the AI team would have to hand-assemble the components as they arrived and instruct the fitters on the sets.|$|E
5|$|Canadian singer-songwriter Mac DeMarco has {{released}} three studio albums, two live albums, three compilation albums, five extended plays (EPs), three singles, and 17 music videos. DeMarco was in several bands {{in high school}} until he graduated in 2008. In 2009, he released his debut EP, Heat Wave, under the name Makeout Videotape. The EP sold out its 500-unit run. DeMarco was joined by Alex Calder and Jen Clement, and Makeout Videotape was signed to <b>Unfamiliar</b> Records. Heat Wave was followed by two EPs, Eating Like a Kid and Bossa Yeye, and one studio album, Ying Yang, all in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{the budget}} led to {{established}} actors being cast in smaller roles, including Adolfo Celi as the villain Valmont and Michel Piccoli as Ginko. John Philip Law was cast as Diabolik as a favour by De Laurentiis after production on Barbarella, which Law was acting in, was postponed due to technical difficulties. Law was initially <b>unfamiliar</b> with the characters in either Barbarella and Diabolik, and read the comic books to understand the characters. Initially, the role of Eva Kant {{was going to be}} played by an unidentified American model, but she was fired before shooting began.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{pipeline}} caused a massive economic boom in towns up and down {{the pipeline}} route. Prior to construction, most residents in towns like Fairbanks—still recovering from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood—strongly supported the pipeline. By 1976, after the town's residents had endured a spike in crime, overstressed public infrastructure, and an influx of people <b>unfamiliar</b> with Alaska customs, 56 percent said the pipeline had changed Fairbanks for the worse. The boom was even greater in Valdez, where the population jumped from 1,350 in 1974 to 6,512 by the summer of 1975 and 8,253 in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, great white sharks do not mistake humans for seals. Many bite {{incidents}} occur in waters with low visibility or other situations which impair the shark's senses. The species appears to {{not like the}} taste of humans, or at least finds the taste <b>unfamiliar.</b> Further research shows that they can tell in one bite {{whether or not the}} object is worth predating upon. Humans, for the most part, are too bony for their liking. They much prefer a fat, protein-rich seal.|$|E
5|$|Defender was Williams Electronics' {{first attempt}} at {{developing}} a new video game; the company's earlier game was a Pong clone. The popularity of coin-operated arcade games in 1979 spurred the company to shift its focus from pinball games to arcade games. The company chose Eugene Jarvis, who had a successful record of Williams pinball games, to head development. Larry DeMar, Sam Dicker, and Paul Dussault assisted Jarvis. At the time, Williams had a small staff and the management was <b>unfamiliar</b> with technology used for its electronic games. As a result, the staff was afforded {{a large amount of}} creative freedom.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, the {{orchestra}} became {{renowned for its}} high standard of playing and for performing new and <b>unfamiliar</b> music. The pioneering work of Boult and the BBC SO included an early performance of Schoenberg's Variations, Op. 31, British premieres, including Berg's Wozzeck and Three Movements from the Lyric Suite, and world premieres, including Vaughan Williams's Symphony No. 4 in F minor. Anton Webern conducted eight BBC SO concerts between 1931 and 1936.|$|E
5|$|During {{the tour}} matches, which were usually played {{consecutively}} {{with only one}} or no days between fixtures, Bradman rotated the trio of openers, so one would generally be rested while the other two opened,N- but in the Tests, Morris and Barnes were preferred. Bradman accommodated Brown in his first-choice team by playing him out of position in the middle order {{in the first two}} Tests and against Worcestershire and the MCC, when he fielded the strongest XI. However, Brown appeared uncomfortable in the <b>unfamiliar</b> role, and after making 73 runs at 24.33 in the first two Tests, he was dropped.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the appeal}} of the Polish Four-Year Sejm to all Poles serving abroad to join the Polish army, and not seeing much {{opportunity}} to advance in his military career in the now-peaceful Saxony, on 28 June 1792 he joined the Army of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth with a rank of podpułkownik and on 14 July he was promoted to the rank of vice-brigadier. Joining in the final weeks of the Polish–Russian War of 1792, he did not see combat in it. <b>Unfamiliar</b> with the intricasies of Polish politics, like many of Poniatowski's supporters, he joined the Targowica Confederation in late 1792.|$|E
5|$|From 1969 to 1972, NASA {{visited the}} real Moon through the Apollo program {{and found that}} its surface does not closely {{resemble}} this part of Idaho. NASA astronauts discovered that real Moon craters were almost all created by meteorites while their namesakes on Earth were created by volcanic eruptions. Apollo astronauts performed part of their training at Craters of the Moon Lava Field by learning to look for and collect good rock specimens in an <b>unfamiliar</b> and harsh environment.|$|E
5|$|Hensley was short, {{normally}} soft-spoken, {{and friendly}} with churchgoers. Most attendees at his services were miners or farmers from the Appalachian Mountains; congregants typically arrived at services on horseback or in a Ford Model A. Many were from Holiness Pentecostal backgrounds, but <b>unfamiliar</b> with the snake-handling practice. Hensley's sister Bertha, {{who lived in}} Ohio, was also a licensed minister with the Church of God. In 1922, he conducted services with her in Ohio. Around that time, more articles documenting his ministry {{were published in the}} denomination's newsletter, and by the early 1920s snakes were regularly handled in Church of God services.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Thio's {{point on the}} views of the Wee Chong Jin Constitutional Commission, Shanmugam said that at the time the report was rendered the electorate was immature and <b>unfamiliar</b> with the importance of voting, a result of the country's history of colonial rule. In contrast, the high voter turnout rates in every election since then evidenced that Singaporeans have realized this point. With regard to the Taw Cheng Kong case, Shanmugam stated that since the Court's observations were obiter, they were unlikely to be treated as setting a precedent.|$|E
5|$|Innis {{laid the}} basis for {{scholarship}} that looked at the social sciences from a distinctly Canadian point of view. As {{the head of the}} University of Toronto's political economy department, he worked to build up a cadre of Canadian scholars so that universities would not continue to rely as heavily on British or American-trained professors <b>unfamiliar</b> with Canada's history and culture. He was successful in establishing sources of financing for Canadian scholarly research.|$|E
5|$|Joachim Roth's {{low-level}} navigation {{had been}} extremely accurate. He had navigated his unit to within two minutes flying {{time from the}} target without interception, over <b>unfamiliar</b> enemy territory, on time and exactly on the planned route. But as the Dorniers neared the airfield they noticed {{that there was no}} smoke, or signs of damage. They expected to be polishing off a damaged fighter station. As the Germans burst over the airfield the air was suddenly filled with tracer rounds as the Dorniers' gunners engaged the Bofors and British AAA defences.|$|E
