40|$|We {{have worked}} out {{research}} and development of a system which forms a basis of e-learning for cellular phone users. In order to develop such a system, it is important to analyze present disadvantages of the e-learning system using cellular phone and to supply basic environments to it. Therefore, we have firstly defined our unique learning contents description format, QDF, and secondly developed both a learning management system (LMS) and an application to the mobile phone (i-appli) by employing Java language. The LMS offers functions such as QDF grammatical check, registration and reading of record information on a collection of problems, reading of explanation on QDF, etc., to a producer of problems. It also serves as transmission of a collection of problems, registration of record information and so on, to an e-learner. The application i-appli provides various kinds of functions to the learner, for example, retrieval and answer to the collection of problems, functions of automatic marking, interruption and resuming, and confirmation of <b>utilization</b> <b>fee.</b> We have verified both the originally developed LMS and i-appli are well operated as a learning support system by uploading them to a server. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A Web Service is {{commonly}} not an independent software en-tity, but {{plays a role}} in some business process. Hence, it depends on the services provided by external Web Services, to provide its own service. While developing and testing a Web Service, such external services are not always available, or their usage comes along with unwanted side ef-fects like, e. g., <b>utilization</b> <b>fees</b> or database modifications. We present a model-based approach to generate stubs for Web Services which respect both an extra-functional contract expressed via a Service Level Agree-ment (SLA), and a functional contract modeled via a state machine. These stubs allow a developer to set up a testbed over the target plat-form, in which the extra-functional and functional behavior of a Web Service under development can be tested before its publication. ...|$|R

By applying the decision support system, it was observed that the reception and expedition costs were exponentially reduced as the turnover rate of the storage increased. The cleaning and drying costs increased linearly with grain initial moisture. The storage cost increased exponentially as the occupancy rate of the storage facility decreased...|$|R
40|$|This paper evaluates two {{recently}} implemented {{strategies to}} control land use conflict and overgrazing in Kajiado district of southern Kenya, stressing {{the importance of}} analyzing attempts to alter traditional pastoralist production systems {{in terms of the}} "complex ethno-ecological mosaic in which political power allocates access to strategic resources". A situation, structure, performance paradigm is applied to the problem. Factors central to the situation which underlie the issue of overgrazing are grounded in the ecological and historical context. Highly unpredictable rainfall, repeated drought, and an increasingly constricted resource base form the primary constraints of the Masai production system. In response, complex cultural adaptations and herd management strategies have evolved to provide maximum security and support for the institution of the family. It is these social factors which must be kept in mind as the evaluation of intervention strategies proceeds. Two intervention strategies designed {{to address the issue of}} overstocking from slightly different perspectives are described in detail and then evaluated in terms of their likely performance outcomes. These strategies are land adjudication into group ranches, and the payment of Wildlife <b>Utilization</b> <b>Fees</b> to group ranches bordering on the national parks. For a number of reasons; especially those related to property rights, and the costs of obtaining information, reaching agreement, and enforcing decisions; it appears unlikely that either strategy will be very effective in changing herd management practices such as mobility or the stocking of large numbers.

30|$|Therefore, the {{empirical}} results {{presented in this}} study do not unambiguously support the arguments of increased social inequality and severe financial reasons that were used for abolishing tuition fees in Germany. Consequently, raising tuition fees of a moderate amount may be a justifiable tool for ensuring university funding. This is particularly relevant {{in the light of}} the worldwide trend of increasing private contributions to the funding of higher education. Müller (2013) discusses several factors concerning the organization of tuition fees, which universities should take into account to increase acceptance for raising tuition fees. Among others, the <b>utilization</b> of <b>fees</b> should be transparent for students and should include all remaining charges. In most German universities, moreover, students had to pay tuition fees in addition to a general administrative charge. This may have been confusing and complicates the comparison of the universities cost-effectiveness (Müller 2013).|$|R

40|$|Health {{literature}} in the Caribbean, and in particular Jamaica, has continued to use objective indices such as mortality and morbidity to examine children’s health. The current study uses subjective indices such as parent-reported health conditions and health status to evaluate the health of children instead of traditional objective indices. The study seeks 1) to examine the health and health care-seeking behaviour of the sample from the parents’ viewpoints; and 2) to compute {{the mean age of}} the sample with a particular illness and describe whether there is an epidemiological shift in these conditions. Two nationally representative cross-sectional surveys were used for this study (2002 and 2007). The sample for the current study is 3, 062 respondents aged less than 5 years. For 2002, the study extracted a sample of 2, 448 under 5 year olds from the national survey of 25, 018 respondents, and 614 under 5 year olds were extracted from the 2007 survey of 6, 728 respondents. Parents-reported information was used to measure issues on children under 5 years old. In 2007, 43. 4 % of the sample had very good health status; 46. 7 % good health status; 2. 5 % poor health and 0. 3 % very poor health status. Almost 15 % of children had illnesses in 2002, and 6 % more had illnesses in 2007 over 2002. In 2002, the percentage of the sample with particular chronic illnesses was: diabetes mellitus (0. 6 %); hypertension (0. 3 %) and arthritis (0. 3 %). However, none was recorded in 2007. The mean age of children less than 5 years old with acute health conditions (i. e. diarrhoea, respiratory diseases and influenza) increased over 2002. In 2007, 43. 4 % of children less than 5 years old had very good health status; 46. 7 % good health status; 7. 1 % fair health status; 2. 5 % poor and 0. 3 % very poor health status. The association between health status and parent- reported illness was –x 2 (df = 4) = 57. 494, P< 0. 001 -with the relationship being a weak one, correlation coefficient= 0. 297. A cross-tabulation between health status and parent-reported diagnosed illness found that a significant statistical correlation existed between the two variables –x 2 (df = 16) = 26. 621, P < 0. 05, cc = 0. 422, – with the association being a moderate one, correlation coefficient = 0. 422. A cross tabulation between health status and health care- seeking behaviour found a significant statistical association between the two variables –x 2 (df = 4) = 10. 513, P < 0. 033 -with the correlation being a weak one-correlation coefficient = 0. 281.

A more appropriate defense, he says, would be that properly conducted peer review [...] which eschews coercion, performs an advisory function, and leaves to others the decision whether to act on its advice [...] actually enhances competition in the consumer 2 ̆ 7 s interest. Contrary to numerous contemporary commentators, he argues that special antitrust exemptions for peer-review bodies are not only unncecessary, but would be counterproductive to the continued evolution of sound antitrust principles.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} direct and extra billing on patient demand for medical services as well as physicians' responses to changing patient demand. These issues are examined {{in the context of}} a "natural experiment" in British Columbia, Canada where, in 1992, 81 general practitioners and specialists "opted-out" of the provincial Medical Services Plan (MSP) and began direct and extra billing their patients. These opted-out physicians are compared to a matched sample of physicians who remained within the MSP. Switching costs for patients were relatively low because of the availability of non-direct/extra billing physicians. The data consists of the more than 140, 000 patient visit claims over a 2 -year time period, one year immediately prior to the opting-out date and one year immediately following. The results of this study show that, on average, female visits to opted-out general practitioners (GPs) dropped approx. 9 % after direct/extra billing. There was no concurrent drop for male patient visits. On average, patient visits to opted-out specialists dropped approx. 6 %. Within the observed timeframe, opted-out physicians' billing patterns changed; somewhat offsetting this demand decrease. On average, opted-out GPs' payments per remaining patient increased by 10 % following direct/extra billing (the post period), while opted-out specialists' payments per patient increased by 7 %. There were no corresponding changes in payments per patient for the control group of physicians who remained opted-in.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} the price responsiveness of utilization of formal children's health-care services in Nepal {{and to use}} this information to model the impact on utilization of subsidies or increases in user fees. METHODS: A total of 8112 individual observations (of children aged < 15 years) from 2847 households in 274 communities {{were obtained from the}} 1996 Nepal Living Standards Survey. A logit model was applied to determine the net impact of price on a parent or caregiver's decision to seek care for a given instance of illness. The model's coefficients were used to calculate the price responsiveness of utilization decisions. FINDINGS: Parents or caregivers reported that 9. 7 % of children (788 / 8112) had been ill or injured in the previous month. Parents reported that they had sought care in 566 (71. 8 %) of these cases; care was most frequently sought from public providers. The price elasticity of demand for children's health-care services in the formal sector was estimated at - 0. 16. As prices rise, the demand curve exhibits continuous and declining price elasticity. Overall, a 100 % subsidy of user fees would increase current utilization rates by 56 %, while a 100 % increase in fees would lead to a drop in utilization of only 12 %. The differential in utilization across income groups was substantial after changes in fees were implemented. CONCLUSION: While the effect of price on the utilization of children's health-care services in Nepal is statistically significant, the size of the impact is modest. Policies to subsidize <b>fees</b> could increase <b>utilization</b> substantially, while <b>fee</b> increases would lead to modest declines in utilization and generate increased revenue...|$|R
40|$|Background User {{fees for}} primary care tend to {{suppress}} utilization, and many countries {{are experimenting with}} fee removal. Studies show that additional inputs are needed after removing fees, although well-documented experiences are lacking. This study presents data {{on the effects of}} fee removal on facility quality and utilization in Afghanistan, based on a pilot experiment and subsequent nationwide ban on fees. Methods Data on utilization and observed structural and perceived overall quality of health care were compared from before-and-after facility assessments, patient exit interviews and catchment area household surveys from eight facilities where fees were removed and 14 facilities where fee levels remained constant, {{as part of a larger}} health financing pilot study from 2005 to 2007. After a national user fee ban was instituted in 2008, health facility administrative data were analysed to assess subsequent changes in utilization and quality. Results The pilot study analysis indicated that observed and perceived quality increased across facilities but did not differ by fee removal status. Difference-in-difference analysis showed that utilization at facilities previously charging both service and drug fees increased by 400 % more after fee removal, prompting additional inputs from service providers, compared with facilities that previously only charged service fees or had no change in fees (P = 0. 001). Following the national fee ban, visits for curative care increased significantly (P < 0. 001), but institutional deliveries did not. Services typically free before the ban—immunization and antenatal care—had immediate increases in utilization but these were not sustained. Conclusion Both pilot and nationwide data indicated that curative care <b>utilization</b> increased following <b>fee</b> removal, without differential changes in quality. Concerns raised by non-governmental organizations, health workers and community leaders over the effects of lost revenue and increased utilization require continued effort to raise revenues, monitor health worker and patient perceptions, and carefully manage health facility performance.

40|$|Background: Peptic ulcer {{bleeding}} (PUB) is {{a serious}} and sometimes fatal condition. The outcome of PUB strongly depends on the risk of rebleeding. A recent multinational placebo-controlled clinical trial (ClinicalTrials. gov identifier: NCT 00251979) showed that high-dose intravenous (IV) esomeprazole, when administered after successful endoscopic haemostasis in patients with PUB, is effective in preventing rebleeding. From a policy perspective {{it is important to}} assess the cost efficacy of this benefit so as to enable clinicians and payers to make an informed decision regarding the management of PUB. Objective: Using a decision-tree model, we compared the cost efficacy of high-dose IV esomeprazole versus an approach of no-IV proton pump inhibitor for prevention of rebleeding in patients with PUB. Method: The model adopted a 30 -day time horizon and the perspective of third-party payers in the USA and Europe. The main efficacy variable was the number of averted rebleedings. Healthcare resource <b>utilization</b> costs (physician <b>fees,</b> hospitalizations, surgeries, pharmacotherapies) relevant for the management of PUB were also determined. Data for unit costs (prices) were primarily taken from official governmental sources, and data for other model assumptions were retrieved from the original clinical trial and the literature. After successful endoscopic haemostasis, patients received either high-dose IV esomeprazole (80 [*]mg infusion over 30 [*]min, then 8 [*]mg/hour for 71. 5 hours) or no-IV esomeprazole treatment, with both groups receiving oral esomeprazole 40 [*]mg once daily from days 4 to 30. Results: Rebleed rates at 30 days were 7. 7 % and 13. 6 %, respectively, for the high-dose IV esomeprazole and no-IV esomeprazole treatment groups (equating to a number needed to treat of 17 in order to prevent one additional patient from rebleeding). In the US setting, the average cost per patient for the high-dose IV esomeprazole strategy was $US 14 [*] 290 compared with $US 14 [*] 239 for the no-IV esomeprazole strategy (year 2007 values). For the European setting, Sweden and Spain were used as examples. In the Swedish setting the corresponding respective figures were Swedish kronor (SEK) 67 [*] 862 ($US 9220 at average 2006 interbank exchange rates) and SEK 67 [*] 807 ($US 9212) [year 2006 values]. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $US 866 and SEK 938 ($US 127), respectively, per averted rebleed when using IV esomeprazole. For the Spanish setting, the high-dose IV esomeprazole strategy was dominant (more effective and less costly than the no-IV esomeprazole strategy) [year 2008 values]. All results appeared robust to univariate/threshold sensitivity analysis, with high-dose IV esomeprazole becoming dominant with small variations in assumptions in the US and Swedish settings, while remaining a dominant approach in the Spanish scenario across a broad range of values. Sensitivity variables with prespecified ranges included lengths of stay and per diem assumptions, rebleeding rates and, in some cases, professional fees. Conclusion: In patients with PUB, high-dose IV esomeprazole after successful endoscopic haemostasis appears to improve outcomes at a modest increase in costs relative to a no-IV esomeprazole strategy from the US and Swedish third-party payer perspective. Whereas, in the Spanish setting, the high-dose IV esomeprazole strategy appeared dominant, being more effective and less costly.
