5|$|<b>Unit</b> <b>prices</b> {{have been}} readjusted and some units renamed, {{as well as}} new ones introduced. New land units include the Bike, a highly mobile {{infantry}} unit that can capture properties; the Flare, an armored vehicle unit that can reveal areas affected by the Fog of War; the Anti-Tank, an indirect-fire unit strong against tanks with the ability to counter-attack during direct attacks; and the War Tank (formerly the Mega Tank), the strongest ground unit in the game. New air units include the Duster, a weaker, lower-cost interceptor that can strike ground units; and the Seaplane, which is produced by Carriers and can attack any unit, but has limited ammo and fuel reserves. Additionally, there is a single new sea unit, the Gunboat, which is armed with a missile salvo that must be resupplied after each use, and can transport one infantry/mech unit. Also, the Battleship was given the ability to move and fire in the same turn, making it the only indirect-combat unit able to do so.|$|E

40|$|We {{conducted}} preference assessments with 4 typically developing {{children to}} identify potential reinforcers and assessed the reinforcing efficacy of those stimuli. Next, we tested two predictions of economic theory: that overall consumption (reinforcers obtained) would decrease as the <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> (response requirement per reinforcer) increased {{and that the}} cost and benefit components that defined <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> would not influence overall consumption considerably when <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> values were equal. We tested these predictions by arranging <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> such that the denominator was one (e. g., two responses produced one reinforcer) or two (e. g., four responses produced two reinforcers). Results showed that consumption decreased as <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> increased and that <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> values with different components produced similar consumption.

5000|$|The {{benefits}} of <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> {{have been widely}} reported in the literature. It {{has been argued that}} <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> reduces time spent comparing brands, eliminates confusion relating to price calculations and ultimately allows shoppers to save money at the register. <b>Unit</b> <b>pricing</b> enables the consumers to rationally evaluate the most economic package size and brand. Accordingly, the time spent determining the most economic purchase is condensed substantially, errors in product price comparisons are significantly reduced, and importantly, lower grocery shopping expenditure is attained. [...] In Australia, despite having <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> legislation, there were no adequate education programs to enable consumers to take advantage of <b>unit</b> <b>pricing.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{behavioral}} economics, {{the ratio}} of response requirement to reinforcer magnitude {{is referred to as}} <b>unit</b> <b>price.</b> Previous research with nonhuman subjects has demonstrated that (a) comparable amounts of food are consumed at the same <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> even though different response requirements and reinforcer magnitudes comprise that <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> and (b) increases in <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> decrease food consumption in a positively decelerating fashion. The present study assessed the generality of these findings to the cigarette smoking of 5 human volunteers. During approximately 18 3 -hr sessions, various combinations of response requirement (fixed-ratio 200, 400, and 1, 600) and reinforcer magnitude (1, 2, and 4 puffs per bout) were arranged. Consumption (i. e., the number of puffs) generally was comparable at the same <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> independent of the response requirement and reinforcer magnitude comprising that <b>unit</b> <b>price.</b> In addition, increasing <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> generally decreased consumption in a positively decelerating fashion. These results extend the generality of the unit-price analysis to human cigarette smoking. Moreover, these results further support the position that reinforcer magnitude and response requirement are functionally equivalent and interact to determine consumption. The concept of <b>unit</b> <b>price,</b> by integrating and summarizing the effects of those two operations, provides a more parsimonious explanation of the results than do separate evaluations of the effects of response requirement and reinforcer magnitude...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the factors that influence the use and understanding of <b>unit</b> <b>pricing.</b> Furthermore, a comparison between a city with a mandated <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> program (Seattle, Washington) and a city with a voluntary <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> program (Portland, Oregon) was made. The intent was to see if there was more use or understanding of <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> in a mandated city. The relationship between the preference for a certain brand and use of <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> was also investigated. Weighted indexes were constructed for use in the computation of individual scores. This researcher cross-classified the variables of sex, income level, level of education, age, and store location with the variables of use scores and understanding scores on a measure of <b>unit</b> <b>pricing.</b> One hundred and twenty consumers (60 in Seattle and 60 in Portland) were interviewed in twelve selected stores.

Consumption declined overall as <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> increased. The equation devised by Hursh et al. and the linear model based on dose fit the data equally well.
