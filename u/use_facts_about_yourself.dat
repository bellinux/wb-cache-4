Second, and conversely, how might listeners <b>use</b> <b>facts</b> <b>about</b> speakers to inform {{their perceptions of}} speech? Results of Experiment 1 demonstrate that listeners can infer characteristics of speakers from their use of an individual sociolinguistic variable. Results of Experiment 2 show that listeners use social information about speakers to understand ambiguous speech. Together, these results show bidirectional influences between language processing {{and the process of}} social inferencing: information in the speech stream affects inferences about social characteristics of the speaker, and social information affects speech perception...|$|R
