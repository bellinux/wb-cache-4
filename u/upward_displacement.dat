However, after heating to the target temperature of 160  °C, the strengthened RC beam was cooled down to ambient temperature, resulting in the recovery stress—namely prestressing force. The prestressing force acted as compression to the tension region of the concrete, which generated the cambering effect. The ultimate <b>upward</b> <b>displacements</b> at mid-span of the strengthened RC beams by the cambering effect were 0.205, 0.218, 0.443, and 0.625  mm, respectively, for SL- 60 S- 2, SL- 30 S- 4, SL- 60 S- 4, and SL- 90 S- 4.|$|R

40|$|After fluid {{injection}} (slickwater) during hydraulic fracturing, the flow-back of fracture fluid {{is necessary}} before gas production starts. A review of fracture treatments {{indicates that the}} incomplete return of treating fluids is {{a reason for the}} failure of hydraulic fracturing and is associated with poor gas production. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the parameters that limit flow-back in low permeability gas wells in the Cooper Basin. The authors used numerical simulation to find the critical controlling parameters to introduce the best practice for maximising the flow-back in the Cooper Basin. Several 3 D and multiphase flow simulation models were constructed for three wells in the Patchawarra Formation during fracture fluid injection, soaking time and during flow-back. All models were validated using history matching with the production data. The results show that the drainage pattern is distinctly different in the following directions: vertically upward, vertically downward, and horizontal along the fracture half-length and along the matrix. The lowest recovery is observed during the <b>upward</b> vertical <b>displacements</b> due to poor sweep efficiency. Furthermore, it is observed that drawdown does not influence the recovery significantly for <b>upward</b> <b>displacements.</b> Surface tension reduction, however, can improve sweep efficiency and improve recovery considerably. Also, the wettability of the rocks has a significant impact on ultimate recovery when the effect of gravity is dominant. The authors conclude that a significant amount of injected fluid is trapped in the formation because of poor sweep efficiency and formation of gas fingers, which results from low mobility ratio and gravity segregation.

Located 1 km northwest, a second GB-InSAR system continuously monitors the large Mannen rockslide. The availability of two GB-InSAR positions creates a wide coverage of the rock slope, including a slight dataset overlap valuable for validation. A phenomenon of rock slope breathing is detected in a remote and hard-to-access area in mid-slope. Millimetric <b>upward</b> <b>displacements</b> are recorded in August 2011. Analysis of 2012 GB-InSAR campaign, combined with the large dataset from the continuous station, shows that the slope is affected by inflation/deflation phenomenon between 5 and 10 mm along the line-of-sight. The pattern is not homogenous in time and inversions of movement have a seasonal recurrence. These seasonal changes are confirmed by satellite InSAR observations and can possibly be caused by hydrogeological variations. In addition, combination of GB-InSAR results, in situ measurements and satellite InSAR analyses contributes to a better overview of movement distribution over the whole area...|$|R
40|$|Pantepui is a biogeographical {{province}} {{composed of}} a group of approximately 50 tabular mountain summits, or tepuis, in the southeast of Venezuela. This region, also known as Guayana Highlands (GH), lies between 1500 and 3014 m elevation and has an approximate extension of 6000 km 2. The summits of the tepuis are characterized by exceptional vascular plant diversity and high endemism. However, it is expected that ongoing global warming will produce <b>upward</b> <b>displacements</b> of summit taxa, which may cause the extinction of certain species due to habitat loss. This study assessed the potential extinction risk of the > 600 Pantepui endemic vascular plant species during the 21 st century due to global warming, revealing that 30 - 50 % of endemic species would lose their habitat {{by the end of this}} century. In light of these results, prioritization of threatened species for conservation purposes became necessary. This was achieved through the calculation of an Environmental Impact Value (EIV) for each species, and a subsequent division of these species into priority categories, which should be used in a chronological sequence to guide decision-making and future research aimed at establishing the most suitable conservation strategies. A number of in situ and ex situ conservation alternatives were discussed. In situ conservation by means of designating protected areas does not appear a viable option because of the <b>upward</b> habitat <b>displacement</b> involved in this case. Conversely, seed banks, living plant collections and managed relocation were suggested in this chronological order to preserve the species studied here.

40|$|Pipelines are {{commonly}} buried underground to provide environmental stability, temperature insulation and mechanical protection. These pipelines are frequently subjected to earthquake induced <b>upward</b> <b>displacements,</b> {{which can cause}} significant social-economic loss to consumers and utility management. Further, high thermal and pressure of the conveying medium can induce differential stresses on the axial restrained pipe to result upward buckling of the pipeline that can disturb the serviceability conditions. The uplift resistance from soil cover protects the pipe against such unwanted movements, representing it as a vital design parameter, in that pipeline integrity under operating conditions relies on its value. The paper presents full-scale uplift results and finite-element parametric studies conducted to investigate the effects of dimensionless cover heights (soil cover height to diameter ratio), soil relative density and moisture content on the peak uplift resistance of pipes. The {{results showed that the}} available analytical models could predict realistic peak uplift resistance for pipes buried at shallower depths, however, they can substantially underpredict the pipe loads/uplift resistance especially when buried at deeper embedded depths and non-dry soil conditions.

50|$|Consider an {{idealized}} rubber sheet suspended {{in a uniform}} gravitational field normal to the sheet.

The mass density may be viewed as intrinsic to the sheet or as belonging to objects resting on top of the sheet.This equilibrium condition is identical in form to the gravitational Poisson equationwhere Φ(x) is the gravitational potential and ρ(x) is the mass density. Thus, to a first approximation, a massive object placed on a rubber sheet will deform the sheet into a correctly shaped gravity well, and (as in the rigid case) a second test object placed near the first will gravitate toward it in an approximation of the correct force law.|$|E

This study examined the effect of artificial femoral head load after acetabular component displacement in total hip arthroplasty. Sixteen total hip arthroplasty models of human cadaver specimens were reconstructed, and under different acetabular component position, the load around the femoral head was evaluated by strain gages. The {{results showed that the}} load was higher in the same specimens when the cup was moved 2  mm inward or upward, especially after the cup was moved more than 6  mm, and the load had an increasing effect in the inward group. In the upward group, an increasing effect happened at 8  mm <b>upward</b> <b>displacement,</b> but the stress value decreased from 4  mm to 6  mm <b>upward</b> <b>displacement.</b> In the same moving distance, the stress of inward displacement is obviously higher than <b>upward</b> <b>displacement.</b> Altogether, the results suggested that for both inward displacement and <b>upward</b> <b>displacement</b> of the acetabular cup, the load around the femoral head increased gradually, while the distance of the inward displacement and the superior displacement was increased.

40|$|AbstractConnected {{foundations}} comprise {{an effective}} option {{for improving the}} mechanical performance of transmission tower foundations. In this study, the load-carrying behavior of connected foundations for transmission tower structures was investigated focusing {{on the effect of}} the load direction based on the field experimental testing program. Improved performances of connected foundations were observed for load directions of both θ= 0 ° and 45 ° considered in this study. The downward settlements at the compressive side for θ= 45 ° were larger than those for θ= 0 °, while the <b>upward</b> <b>displacements</b> were similar. For both vertical and lateral displacements, the use of connected foundations was more effective for θ= 45 °, and the effectiveness became more pronounced as the connection-beam stiffness increased. However, the lateral load-carrying capacities for θ= 0 ° and 45 ° were not significantly different for all connection-beam conditions. From the prototype-scaled model load tests, it was confirmed that the use of connected foundations for transmission tower structures is similarly effective for different load directions.

40|$|Purpose: A {{possible}} {{way for the}} quantitative evaluation of the acupuncture therapy is the measurement {{of the change in}} the elastic property of muscle due to application of the acupuncture therapy. Many studies have been conducted to measure mechani-cal properties of tissues by applying an ultrasound-induced acoustic radiation force. To assess mechanical properties, strain of an object must be generated. However, one radiation force is not effective because it also generates translational motion when the object is much harder than surrounding medium. In this study, two cyclic radia-tion forces are applied to a muscle phantom from two opposite horizontal directions so that the object is cyclically compressed in the horizontal direction. Methods: By the horizontal compression, the object is vertically expanded due to the incompressibility. The resultant vertical displacement is measured using ultrasound. Two ultrasonic transducers for actuation were both driven by sums of two continuous sinusoidal signals at two slightly different frequencies (1 MHz and (1 M+ 5) Hz). Results: The displacement of several micrometers in amplitude,which fluctuated at 5 Hz, measured by the ultrasonic phased tracking method. <b>Upward</b> <b>displacements</b> at the surface were found when acoustic radiation forces increased.

40|$|Pipelines {{used for}} the {{transportation}} {{of oil and gas}} products offshore are often buried beneath the seabed for protection from mechanical damage and for thermal insulation. During high temperature and high pressure operations, these pipelines are susceptible to resurfacing behaviour known as upheaval buckling, a structural response that is strongly influenced by the resistance of the surrounding soil. Despite much previous research on pipe uplift, the influence of the initial soil state – particularly in loose and liquefiable soil conditions – on the uplift resistance and corresponding buckling behaviour of the pipe is not well understood. This thesis presents research that examines the implications of these backfill conditions {{in the context of the}} global behaviour of the pipeline. The work consists of plane-strain monotonic uplift experiments focusing on density, rate, and stress level effects on the initial pipe-soil response. This is followed by numerical modelling of the global buckling behaviour using the experimental data as inputs. Finally, plane-strain cyclic experiments examine the possibility of progressive <b>upward</b> <b>displacements</b> over a number of cycles causing eventual upheaval buckling. A key finding from the uplift tests is that very loose backfill conditions may result in a localised flow-around failure mechanism, associated with lower peak resistance and a softer force-displacement response than with the sliding block mechanism that is typically assumed. This leads to lower peak buckling loads/temperatures than those predicted by current design guidelines. High quality data from both the monotonic and cyclic experiments was used to assess and suggest improvements to design guidance for these conditions. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R

These oculomotor alterations were not directly related to the type of ALS at onset of the illness, nor with its duration. However they were correlated with the relative degree of the clinical bilateral pyramidal tract signs at the supraspinal level.

Since the wood diagonals simply bear on node blocks, the two diagonals in a panel are both functional only if precompressed. To properly rehabilitate Howe bridges and to guide new designs, {{it is important to understand}} the prestress forces that are induced initially and how they change with time. Results of linear elastic analyses for the actions of tensioning vertical rods and temperature changes are reported. Tensioning vertical rods at one location induces forces primarily in the two adjacent panels and causes very small <b>upward</b> vertical <b>displacements.</b> An increase in temperature decreases prestress forces; therefore, prestressing should not be done at low temperatures. A linear viscoelastic analysis is formulated using a standard-linear-solid constitutive model. The formulation is used to predict the time-dependent behavior of the Pine Bluff Bridge in Indiana.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Results {{of three}} {{experiments}} {{related to the}} role of the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) in the control of gaze are described. (1) Chronic unit recording methods, used to study the on-directions of short-lead burst neurons in head-restrained monkeys, and (2) reversible inactivation tech-niques confirmed the traditional view of the importance of PPRF in the control of horizontal eye movements. Reversible inactivation of neurons in the vicinity of identified short-lead burst neurons produced dramatic reductions in the speed of saccades to horizontal target displacements. The reductions in velocity were largely compensated for by an increase in saccade duration. Only minor, if any, effects were observed upon the velocity, duration, and amplitude of sac-cades to <b>upward</b> target <b>displacements.</b> (3) Microstimulation was applied to om-nipause neurons to gate activity of excitatory burst neurons that discharge during coordinated eye-head movements. The microstimulation failed to noticeably slow (prevent) head movements when stimulation was applied dur-ing (prior to onset of) gaze shifts, suggesting that signals relayed to motoneu-rons innervating the neck muscles are not inhibited by the omnipause neurons. In other words, the desired gaze signal is parsed into eye and head pathways upstream of the excitatory burst neurons...|$|R

The uplift tests performed on footings founded on sand enabled estimations to be made of the suction that developed {{at the base of the}} footings founded on clay. It is shown that the suction mobilised at very fast rates may be assessed using existing undrained bearing capacity approaches and a (rate corrected) operational undrained strength similar to that measured in triaxial extension.
