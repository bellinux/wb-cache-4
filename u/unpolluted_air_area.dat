40|$|Our {{purpose was}} to {{determine}} whether exposure to a realistic concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) could increase the bronchial sensitivity of asthmatic patients to bronchoconstrictor agents. We established dose-response curves for changes in specific airway resistance (SRaw) in response to aerosolized carbachol in 20 asthmatics after each had spent 1 h in an exposure chamber breathing on one occasion <b>unpolluted</b> <b>air</b> and on a separate occasion 0. 1 ppm NO 2 : sequence of exposures to <b>unpolluted</b> <b>air</b> and to low levels of NO 2 were randomized in a single-blind fashion. NO 2 induced a slight but significant increase in initial SRaw and enhanced the bronchoconstrictor effect of carbachol in 13 subjects: curves were shifted to the left and the mean dose of carbachol producing a twofold increase in initial SRaw was decreased from 0. 66 mg to 0. 36 mg (P less than 0. 001). In contrast, NO 2 neither modified the initial SRaw nor the bronchoconstrictor effect of carbachol in seven subjects. In 4 out of the 20 subjects, exposure to a higher concentration of NO 2 (0. 2 ppm) yielded variable results. Potentiation of the carbachol bronchoconstrictor response by NO 2 could not be related to any physical or clinical characteristics of the subjects tested. Although the mechanisms underlying the NO 2 effect remain controversial, the present results demonstrate that very low levels of NO 2 can adversely affect some asthmatics...|$|R

40|$|By far {{the most}} {{abundant}} hydrocarbon in <b>unpolluted</b> <b>air</b> is methane (mixing ratio cu. 1. 6 ppm). The mixing ratios of other hydrocarbons are typically in the low parts per lo 9 (ppb) and parts per 10 ” (ppt) ranges. Although methane is several orders of magnitude more abundant in clean air, {{it is conceivable that}} other hydrocarbons are still of considerable importance to clean air photochemistry, because their reaction with hydroxyl radicals proceeds much faster than that of methane. Owing to this high reactivity of many of the light non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), mixing ratios of NMHC as low as a few ppb or several ppt can have a considerable influence on the photochemistry of <b>unpolluted</b> <b>air.</b> For this reason a gas chromatographic method has been developed that permits the determination of several C 2 -C, hydrocarbons with detection limits of a few ppt from grab samples of 0. 5 -Z dm 3 (STP). The samples are collected in evacuated 2 - 1 stainless-steel containers with metal bellows-sealed stainless-steel valves. These sample collection and storage cans are specially pre-treated and cleaned to avoid changes in sample composition during transport of the samples to the laboratory. In the laboratory the samples are analysed by enrichment of the hydrocarbons on a packed pre-column at sub-ambient temperatures (L’LI. - 35 °C) and subsequent separation on a 7 m x 0. 8 mm I. D. packed column (Spherosil XOB 075). A flame-ionization detector is used.

This research examines guidance {{school and high school}} students' ideas about air pollution and the results may be useful for the respective authorities to improve cultural and educational aspects of next generation. In this cross-sectional study, a closed questionnaire was used to examine knowledge and ideas of 2140 randomly selected school students of Tehran-Iran about composition of <b>unpolluted</b> <b>air,</b> air pollution and its causes and consequences. Cognitive scores were also calculated. Outcomes were compared with results of similar researches in Australia, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. While a student's 'cognitive score' could range from - 16 to + 16, Iranian students' mean cognitive score was equal to + 2. 97. There was not significant statistical difference between girls and boys (P= 0. 32). In response to question "most common gas in unpolluted air" nitrogen was mentioned by only 23. 7 %, While 45. 1 % of students mentioned oxygen. In general, student's knowledge was not acceptable and there were some misconceptions such as "supposing oxygen as the most prevalent gas in unpolluted air".

The polluted waters or polluted air also created as {{part of the process of}} producing the car is an external cost borne by those who are affected by the pollution or who value <b>unpolluted</b> <b>air</b> or water. Because the manufacturer does not pay for this external cost (the cost of emitting undesirable waste into the commons), and does not include this cost in the price of the car (a Kaldor-Hicks compensation), they are said to be external to the market pricing mechanism. The air pollution from driving the car is also an externality produced by the car user in the process of using his good.

The second identical façade, also draped with the same creeper, is exposed to varying levels of SOx, NOx and Suspended Particulate Matter at a busy traffic junction on Katpadi road Vellore, In Tamilnadu, India. Sensitivity studies shall be presented based on the deposition pattern of pollutants on these two facades. Scanning Electron Micrographs will elucidate the mechanistic details of the deposition patterns of suspended particulate matter, whilst liquid extraction methods coupled with Spectrophotometric analyses will reveal the concentrations of sulphates and nitrates assimilated by the stoma and the mesophilic tissues from street pollution. Finally, results from a computational model will be presented enabling one to calculate the deposition velocities of SOx and NOx on to the facades...|$|R

40|$|People {{assess the}} quality of the air indoors {{primarily}} {{on the basis of its}} odors and on their perception of associated health risk. The major current contributors to indoor odorants are human occupant odors (body odor), environmental tobacco smoke, volatile building materials, bio-odorants (particularly mold and animal-derived materials), air fresheners, deodorants, and perfumes. These are most often present as complex mixtures, making measurement of the total odorant problem difficult. There is no current method of measuring human body odor, other than by human panel studies of expert judges of air quality. Human body odors have been quantitated in terms of the "olf" which is the amount of air pollution produced by the average person. Another quantitative unit of odorants is the "decipol," which is the perceived level of pollution produced by the average human ventilated by 10 L/sec of <b>unpolluted</b> <b>air</b> or its equivalent level of dissatisfaction from nonhuman air pollutants. The standard regulatory approach, focusing on individual constituents or chemicals, is not likely to be successful in adequately controlling odorants in indoor air.
