40|$|Abstract — oblique {{and normal}} {{impingement}} of a circular liquid jet with a horizontal target {{gives rise to}} hydraulic jumps of unique shapes. Hydrodynamics of this phenomenon have been experimentally investigated in the present work. An obliquely inclined and <b>normal</b> <b>circular</b> water jet, impinging on a flat horizontal surface, confers a series of hydraulic jump profiles, pertaining to different jet inclinations and jet velocities. The present work attempts to find a geometric and hydrodynamic characterization of the spatial patterns formed {{as a consequence of}} such noncircular and circular hydraulic jump profiles. The aim of the present study is to elucidate the mechanisms of the formation of certain irregular and non-intuitive shapes of hydraulic jump profiles, originated as a consequence of oblique and normal impingement of single circular liqui...|$|R

40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of a linear elastic half-space containing a rigid-lubricated cylindrical inclusion is considered for an axisymmetric <b>normal</b> <b>circular</b> line load which is suddenly applied {{on the plane}} surface.

The finite integrals are observed to contain discrete points of discontinuity which can be associated with direct and reflected P-and S-waves propagating along the surface, in addition to the Rayleigh waves.

40|$|The {{following}} question has recently arisen {{in the literature}} concerning {{the interpretation of the}} optical activity of biological membranes: do the characteristic spectral distortions observed for diverse membrane systems reflect some common and unique aspect of membrane architecture or are they the result of scattering effects owing to the particulate nature of membranous systems? We have confirmed the latter interpretation {{on the basis of the}} following experimental observations: (a) red blood cell membranes give a <b>normal</b> <b>circular</b> dichroism spectrum when scattering is reduced and (b) nonaggregated, nonmembranous helical proteins give distorted membranelike spectra when scattering is introduced. An improved estimate of secondary structure on the basis of undistorted spectra results in about 50 per cent α-helix for red blood cell membrane protein. In addition we conclude that the distortions in optical activity spectra offer no evidence in support of various proposed membrane models...|$|R

30|$|Motivated by the experiments, in this article, we {{employ the}} quasi-continuum method [14, 37] to {{determine}} the stable cross-sectional configurations of free-standing MWCNTs with different inter-wall spacings and different radii of innermost walls. We show that both factors play significant roles in regulating the cross-sectional configurations of the MWCNTs. Our simulations show that the cross-sections of the free-standing MWCNTs deviate from the <b>normal</b> <b>circular</b> shape and may be stabilized at polygonal or water-drop-like shapes, depending on the inter-wall spacings. In addition, when the radius of the innermost wall in an MWCNT is beyond a critical value, the cross-sections of the MWCNTs may also be stabilized at polygonal shapes {{and the extent of}} cross-section polygonization is even greater. These modeling results agree with prior experimental observations. We attribute the stable corrugated cross-sections to the compressive stress induced by the release of the excessive inter-wall vdW energies in the MWCNTs.|$|R

Large velocity dispersion are observed of upt o 120 km/s in the nuclear region, of up to 70 km/s near the eastern bright sources just beyond the edge of the stellar bar where three spiral arms seem to start and in the western bright sources at about 10 kpc.

The dispersion characteristic was investigated based on an equivalent circuit model. The interaction impedance and the S-parameter of a RB-FW traveling-wave tube were analyzed by numerical simulations.

The influence of the initial electron energy, frequency, input power, guiding magnetic field, and aspect ratio of the RB tunnel on the circuit performance was observed, and physical explanations were given. It reveals that the output power of RB-FW can reach 51. 1 [*]dBm, 8. 4 % dBm higher than a CB-FW, with a 3 [*]dB bandwidth of 35 [*]GHz when the beam voltage and current are set to 14. 25 [*]kV and 140 [*]mA, respectively.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} {{of a baby}} skyrmion configuration, in a model Landau-Lifshitz equation, was studied {{in the presence of}} various potential obstructions. The baby skyrmion configuration was constructed from two Q= 1 hedgehog solutions to the baby skyrme model in (2 + 1) dimensions. The potential obstructions were created by introducing a new term into the Lagrangian which resulted in a localised inhomogeneity in the potential terms' coefficient. In the barrier system, the <b>normal</b> <b>circular</b> path was deformed as the skyrmions traversed the barrier. During the same period, it was seen that the skyrmions sped up as they went over the barrier. For critical values of the barrier height and width, the skyrmions were no longer bound and were free to separate. In the case of a potential hole, the baby skyrmions no longer formed a bound state and moved asymptotically along the axis of the hole. It is shown how to modify the definition of the angular momentum to include the effects of the obstructions, so that it is conserved. Comment: 27 pages, 11 figures, 2 table...|$|R

40|$|A 2 D cone shape {{has been}} added to the <b>normal</b> <b>circular</b> tubes of heat {{exchangers}} to minimize the area of stagnation and to stream line the air flow around the heat exchanger tubes. An experimental setup has been developed to study the influence of the apex angle of the cone shaped tubes on particulate fouling of heat exchangers. Fouling experiments have been performed in which calcium carbonate particles are injected during the experiments and the depositions of particles on the tubes of the heat exchanger is monitored. Four sets of experiments have been performed, in which normal cylindrical tubes and coned tubes with an apex angle of 60, 90 and 120 dgrs are examined. It was found that particulate fouling ceased if the apex angle of the cone shaped tubes is smaller than 90 dgrs. The attached cones enhance the flow around the tubes of the heat exchanger, i. e. by minimizing the stagnation area and keeping the flow attached to the tubes starting from the tip of the attached cone until separation, such that particles which deposit {{on the top of the}} tubes of the heat exchanger can be removed by the air flow...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a single-wound {{toroidal}} {{helix antenna}} (SWTHA) and a contra-wound toroidal helix antenna (CWTHA) are analyzed in an analytical way. In this connection, the total winding {{length of a}} SHTA is estimated and a fairly accurate and closed-form expression of the length is obtained. Meanwhile, a closed form solution of the electromagnetic fields in far zone or their alternative vector potential components is obtained. The formulation is analytical, {{based on the assumption}} of uniform SWTHA and CWTHA currents and the large ratio of the toroidal antenna radius over the turn radius. The solution is general enough for any number of wound turns. The results are finally reduced to those existing results available elsewhere in literature by letting the radius be zero (for infinitely thin wire and circular loop antennas) and the winding number be zero (for the <b>normal</b> <b>circular</b> loop antennas). The reduced results of the potential components are the same as those in the textbooks. The analytical results are obtained for the first time, useful for antenna designers and also antenna engineering education.

The spanwise wavelength, λ 0, of an array of streamwise vortices on a <b>normal</b> <b>circular</b> cylinder was addressed by Kestin and Wood. That theory was for the limiting case of zero sweep {{and the results are}} here confirmed experimentally. These {{observations of}} streamwise vortices on unswept cylinders confirm the earlier predictions, providing a firm basis for referencing new measurements of vortical behaviour. The work on unswept cylinders provides an excellent benchmark for sweep effects. The principal published collection of results for medium to high sweep angles, Λ, is that of Poll, covering sweep angles between 55 ° and 71 °. Surface flow visualization has been undertaken by the authors giving lateral spacing and streak orientation for sweep angles from zero to 61 o. Results for lateral spacing are consistent with those of Poll, covering the range between the zero sweep results of Kestin and Wood and the medium to high sweep cases addressed by Poll.
