40|$|We have {{performed}} momentum management analysis of various JWST schedules created using the JWST Mission Simulator and an enhanced Science and Operations Design Reference Mission. This study used the latest available torque tables and investigated three modes of Visit orientation assignment used {{to manage the}} momentum accumulation. In addition, the conditional scheduling of momentum <b>unloads,</b> and performing partial momentum <b>unloads</b> when possible was also investigated. Assuming one failed reaction wheel and the worst case torque tables, {{we find that the}} number of momentum <b>unload</b> activities per Station Keeping interval violates the existing Science & Operations Center requirement that limits the number of momentum <b>unloads</b> to two per interval. It was found that 65 % of the Station Keeping intervals had three or more Momentum <b>Unloads.</b> This required a change in the Orbit Determination method used to one less sensitive to multiple orbit perturbations. We also find that the roll optimization of scheduled visits and the conditional scheduling of partial Momentum <b>Unloads</b> provide a reduction of the stored momentum to be <b>unloaded,</b> a reduction of the number of Momentum <b>Unloads,</b> and a reduction of the time required to perform the Momentum <b>Unloads</b> as compared to un-optimized schedules. It is recommended that the Optimize Last Visit orientation assignment mode, partial Momentum <b>Unloads,</b> and the conditional scheduling of Momentum <b>Unloads</b> should be implemented. In addition, the Observatory design is being changed substantially {{at the time of this}} study and may change again in the future. It is recommended the study be repeated at each major Observatory design milestone...|$|R

50|$|As {{container}} ships {{usually have}} no on-board cranes or other mechanism to load or <b>unload</b> their cargo, they are therefore dependent on dockside container cranes to load and <b>unload.</b> However lift-on/lift-off vessels can load and <b>unload</b> their own cargo unassisted.

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} a novel method for the {{derivation}} of the <b>unloaded</b> geometry of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) from a pressurized geometry in turn obtained by 3 D reconstruction of computed tomography (CT) images. The approach was experimentally validated with an aneurysm phantom loaded with gauge pressures of 80, 120, and 140 mm Hg. The <b>unloaded</b> phantom geometries estimated from these pressurized states were compared to the actual <b>unloaded</b> phantom geometry, resulting in mean nodal surface distances of up to 3. 9 % of the maximum aneurysm diameter. An in-silico verification was also performed using a patient-specific AAA mesh, resulting in maximum nodal surface distances of 8 lm after running the algorithm for eight iterations. The methodology was then applied to 12 patient-specific AAA for which their corresponding <b>unloaded</b> geometries were generated in 5 - 8 iterations. The wall mechanics resulting from finite element analysis of the pressurized (CT image-based) and <b>unloaded</b> geometries were compared to quantify {{the relative importance of}} using an <b>unloaded</b> geometry for AAA biomechanics. The pressurized AAA models underestimate peak wall stress (quantified by the first principal stress component) on average by 15 % compared to the <b>unloaded</b> AAA models. The validation and application of the method, readily compatible with any finite element solver, underscores the importance of generating the <b>unloaded</b> AAA volume mesh prior to using wall stress as a biomechanical marker for rupture risk assessment...|$|R

40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} (EM) {{analysis and}} design of a n-element <b>unloaded</b> coupled-microstrip-line TEM resonator are {{presented in this paper}} by using the finite element method (FEM) and method of moments (MoM) in two dimensions. The analysis allows the determination of the primary inductive and capacitive matrices ([L], [C 0]) and simulates the frequency response of S 11 at the RF port of the designed n-element <b>unloaded</b> coupled-microstrip-line TEM resonator. As an application, we present the design results of a MRI probe using a 12 -element <b>unloaded</b> coupled-microstrip-line TEM resonator and operating at 200 MHz (proton imaging at 4. 7 T). The probe has- 118 dB minimum reflection and an <b>unloaded</b> quality factor Qo> 500 at 200 MHz. The twelve-element <b>unloaded</b> coupledmicrostrip-line TEM resonator can be designed at any resonance frequency for MRI applications, using the EM parameters values presented into this paper...|$|R

40|$|The <b>unloaded</b> human finger with a taut deep flexor {{functions}} as a bi-articular chain, because the angulations of the distal two joints are mechanically coupled. In this chain two flexors exist: the superficial and deep flexor. However, for elementary control of the <b>unloaded</b> finger, only one flexor is required. This puts forward the question of which flexor is most suited for <b>unloaded</b> finger control. In the present paper {{it is argued that}} due to the chiasma tendinum and the coupled rotations of the distal two joints, the deep flexor is anatomically better positioned than the superficial flexor for optimal <b>unloaded</b> finger control.

5|$|Elk {{handling}} facilities are areas of pens with loading and <b>unloading</b> ramps where {{water and food}} are provided to the elk. They were created to help reduce herd numbers by increasing wariness and encouraging migratory behaviour, deterring the elk {{from the town of}} Banff. These measures allowed more predator–prey interactions thanks to the creation of corridors. They also increased elk migration, restored the willow and aspen communities and highlighted the primary role of wolves in elk population management.|$|E

5|$|These {{analyses}} are conducted when traveling empty, loading and <b>unloading,</b> when partially and fully loaded, and {{under conditions of}} temporary overloading. Places subject to the largest stresses are studied carefully, such as hold-bottoms, hatch-covers, bulkheads between holds, and the bottoms of ballast tanks. Great Lakes bulkers also must be designed to withstand springing, or developing resonance with the waves, which can cause fatigue fractures.|$|E
