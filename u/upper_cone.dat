The main attention is paid to flat nominative data called nominative sets. The structure of the partially-ordered set of nominative sets is investigated in terms of set theory, lattice theory, and algebraic systems theory. To achieve this aim the correct transferring of basic set-theoretic operations to nominative sets is proposed.

In particular, we study groups for which the spaces of left orders are homeomorphic to the Cantor set, and their Turing degree spectra contain certain <b>upper</b> <b>cones</b> of degrees. Our approach unifies and extends Sikora’s investigation of orders on groups in topology [28] and Solomon’s investigation of these orders in computable algebra [31].

40|$|Relativistic spin-orbit {{coupling}} {{plays an}} essential role in the field of topological insulators and quantum spintronics. It gives rise to the topological non-trivial band structure and enables electric manipulation of the spin degree of freedom. Because of the spin-orbit coupling, rich spin-orbital coupled textures can exist both in momentum and in real space. For three dimensional topological insulators in the Bi$_ 2 $Se$_ 3 $ family, topological surface states with p$_z$ orbitals have a left-handed spin texture for the <b>upper</b> Dirac <b>cone</b> and a right-handed spin texture for the lower Dirac cone. In this work, we predict a new form of the spin-orbital texture associated with the p$_x$ and p$_y$ orbitals. For the <b>upper</b> Dirac <b>cone,</b> a left-handed (right-handed) spin texture is coupled to the "radial" ("tangential") orbital texture, whereas for the lower Dirac cone, the coupling of spin and orbital textures is the exact opposite. The "tangential" ("radial") orbital texture is dominant for the <b>upper</b> (lower) Dirac <b>cone,</b> leading to the right-handed spin texture for the in-plane orbitals of both the upper and lower Dirac cones. A spin-resovled and photon polarized angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiment is proposed to observe this novel spin-orbital texture. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

For downward oscillations, we characterize the functions g such that (∃∞n) K(X↾n) <n+g(n) for almost every X∈ 2 ω. The {{proof of this}} result uses an improvement of Chaitin's counting theorem—we give a tight upper bound {{on the number of}} strings σ∈ 2 n such that K(σ) <n+K(n) −m.

40|$|Abstract. Every K-trivial set is computable from an {{incomplete}} Martin-Löf random set, i. e., a Martin-Löf random set {{that does not}} compute H 1. A major objective in algorithmic randomness is to understand how random sets and computably enumerable (c. e.) sets interact within the Turing degrees. At some level of randomness all interesting interactions cease. Computably enumerable sets are each definable and, in a sense, they are as effective as any noncomputable set can be. As a consequence, the lower and <b>upper</b> <b>cones</b> of noncomputable c. e. sets are definable null sets, and thus if a set is “sufficiently ” random, it cannot compute, nor be computed by, a noncomputable c. e. set. However, the most studied notion of algorithmic randomness, Martin-Löf randomness, is {{not strong enough to}} support this argument, and in fact, significant interactions between Martin-Löf random sets and c. e. sets occur. The study of these interactions has lead to a number of surprising results that show a remarkably robust relationship between Martin-Löf random sets and the class of K-trivial sets. Interestingly, the significant interaction occurs “at the boundaries”: the Martin-Löf random sets in question are close t...|$|R
