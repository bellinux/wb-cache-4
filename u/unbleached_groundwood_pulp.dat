In 1934, a large concrete pad was constructed for storing “lapped <b>groundwood</b> <b>pulp.</b> Because of the water-driven groundwood mill, at time of high water availability, excess groundwood was manufactured for use when the water flow was low. Separation of frozen laps was difficult during cold Minnesota winters. When separation was not possible with crowbars, dynamite was used. The lapped <b>groundwood</b> <b>pulp</b> was then brought into the mill and placed into beaters for repulping and use.|$|R
40|$|The way {{in which}} the washing of pulp is {{affected}} by the type of pulp used was investigated in this work by using a new measurement technique. The experimental equipment developed was a test piston press equipped with a γ-radiation source and a scintillation detector that was used to measure concentrations within the pulp bed during the washing process. Three types of pulps were used: sulphite, kraft and mechanical (<b>groundwood)</b> <b>pulp.</b> It was shown that the washing of mechanical pulp differs greatly from the washing of chemical pulp. The dispersion coefficient was found to be a factor 10 larger for mechanical pulp than for chemical pulp. The difference was explained by the difference in fibre properties: the shorter fibres and the large amount of fibres present in <b>groundwood</b> <b>pulp</b> facilitate well-formed beds in which little channelling is present. It was also concluded from the local measurements that the dispersion effect {{at the top of the}} bed of the mechanical pulps was mostly attributed to inlet mixing. The influence of inlet mixing on the overall dispersion coefficient was however small. This result illustrates the usefulness of the new measurement technique since it could not have been obtained using traditional measurement techniques...|$|R

A three-company merger formed the Nokia Corporation in 1967; Nokian Tyres Limited {{was established in}} 1988 as a joint venture company split from the conglomerate as Nokia Corporation started focusing entirely on the mobile communications business. Nokian is [...] "Nokia" [...] in the genitive, thus Nokian renkaat meaning [...] "Tyres of Nokia".

In 1865, {{mining engineer}} Fredrik Idestam established a <b>groundwood</b> <b>pulp</b> mill {{on the banks}} of the Tammerkoski rapids in the town of Tampere, in southwestern Finland. In 1868, Idestam built a second mill near the town of Nokia, [...] west of Tampere by the Nokianvirta River, which had better resources for hydroelectric production. In 1871, with the help of his close friend, the statesman Leo Mechelin, Idestam renamed and transformed his mills into a share company, founding the Nokia Company.|$|R

It was determined that the first pass fines retentions of furnishes which contained both stone <b>groundwood</b> and kraft <b>pulps</b> progressively increased with increase of APAM dosage. On the other hand, with 1 % APAM addition, drainage time for unfilled and filled pulp suspensions which consisted of 80 % stone <b>groundwood</b> <b>pulp</b> and 20 % bleached kraft pulp increased 164 % and 184 % more than those of furnishes without APAM addition, respectively.

50|$|There are {{two major}} {{mechanical}} pulps: thermomechanical <b>pulp</b> (TMP) and <b>groundwood</b> <b>pulp</b> (GW). In the TMP process, wood is chipped and then fed into steam heated refiners, where the chips are squeezed and converted to fibres between two steel discs. In the groundwood process, debarked logs are fed into grinders where they are pressed against rotating stones to be made into fibres. Mechanical pulping does not remove the lignin, so the yield is very high, >95%, however it causes the paper thus produced to turn yellow and become brittle over time. Mechanical pulps have rather short fibres, thus producing weak paper. Although large amounts of electrical energy are required to produce mechanical pulp, it costs less than the chemical kind.|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} is {{a widely}} used bleaching chemical for mechanical pulps and is particularly useful when high brightness levels are required. The objective of this work was to study fines as a limiting factor for reaching higher brightness levels in high consistency hydrogen peroxide bleaching of Norway spruce (Picea abies) thermomechanical (TMP) and stone <b>groundwood</b> (SGW) <b>pulps.</b> The hydrogen peroxide bleaching efficiency (i. e. light absorption coefficient reduction) was studied {{as a function of}} temperature, alkali charge and fines content using an experimental design based on MODDE software (Umetrics AB). It is known that all types of fines contain more lignin, hemicelluloses, pectins, metals and less cellulose than long fibres. The light absorption coefficient was greater for unbleached TMP than for unbleached SGW pulp and an increased quantity of fines increased the light absorption coefficient for both pulp types. The increase was, however, most pronounced for the TMP. Furthermore, the data suggests that both the fibre fraction and the fines fraction are more coloured in the thermomechanical pulp. In most cases, increased amounts of fines in the pulp had a negative impact on the bleached pulp brightness in spite of the improved light scattering ability accompanying the addition of fines. A level of fines exceeding 50 % was especially detrimental resulting in lower pulp brightness due to a higher light absorption coefficient. Increasing the bleaching temperature did not improve the bleaching efficiency. The optimal bleaching temperature at a hydrogen peroxide charge of 4. 5 % was found to be 70 °C within the tested interval of 70 - 110 °C. For a fines content of 25 %, the stone <b>groundwood</b> <b>pulp</b> displayed a brightness of 83 % whereas the thermomechanical pulp achieved a brightness of 79 %...|$|R

The increasing complexity of work affects the proportion of physical to mental effort which workers spend {{in the performance of}} their jobs. Traditional work measurement techniques which are primarily designed to measure the individual's physical load have to be complemented with other techniques to evaluate his mental load. This study is aimed at developing a methodology which {{can be applied to the}} analysis and measurement of the mental contribution of workers and its associated effects. Information Theory and the Theory of Communication are used to provide a conceptual framework in which information processes employed in the performance of industrial tasks are identified and evaluated. Depending on their complexity, the various information processes called mental therbligs, are classified according to four levels of integrative behavior. Information processing rates are calculated on the basis of the amount of information transmitted in the performance of these therbligs. Average and, where possible, peak rates are obtained for typical jobs representing two or more technological levels in four different segments of the forest products industry: a. Lumber Sorting b.

40|$|The thesis {{comprises}} three parts: Existing {{methods for}} characterisation of fibre crosssections have been improved, and new {{methods have been}} developed. These methods have then been applied to {{study the effects of}} wood characteristics and the pulping process on mechanical pulp fibres. Links have been established between fibre structure and paper properties such as surface smoothness and light scattering coefficient. New methods, based on SEM-images and image analysis, are described for providing cross-sectional fibre dimensions for large fibre populations, for wood tracheids (app. 60 000 tracheids in a wood trunk) and for processed pulp fibres (app. 1000 fibres per sample). The methods are suited e. g. for evaluation of changes in the fibre cross-sections from wood to the finished paper, or for mapping of fibre parameters within and between growth rings in a wood trunk. The treatment of data is discussed, showing how one may examine the changes in different groups of fibres (earlywood fibres, latewood fibres, split fibres) throughout a process. It is known from the literature that groundwood-based paper is superior to TMP-based paper with respect to printability. Fibres from SGW and PGW-pulp were found to be much more split in the longitudinal direction than TMP-fibres at comparable freeness. Intact groundwood fibres had thicker walls than intact TMP-fibres, but nevertheless super calendered hand sheets made from groundwood fibres were less roughened by moistening than were TMP-based sheets. Both for <b>groundwood</b> <b>pulps</b> and for TMPpulps, it was shown that reduced fibre wall thickness and increased fibre splitting was beneficial for improved surface smoothness and opacity. Latewood defibrate easier than earlywood during refining. In the case of grinding, there was no particular preference for earlywood or latewood to be defibrated. Reject refining of groundwood reject was, however, found to be very important for defibration of latewood-containing shives. Pulps made from a raw material with more compact fibres (high wall area to lumen area ratio) were found to defibrate easier, and contain less shives. It was found that refining tends to reduce wall thickness most on thickwalled parts of the fibre, thus causing a reduction of the wall thickness variation around the perimeter. Earlywood fibres were found to be preferentially split during refining. Most fibre splitting occurs during the primary stage, while the fibres are firmly attached to chips or fibre bundles. Latewood fibre wall thickness decreases considerably more than earlywood fibre wall thickness during refining. It seems that choosing an appropriate raw material is more effective than using excessive energy on reducing the wall thickness of thickwalled fibres. Earlywood fibres became more flattened during refining compared to latewood fibres, possibly due to repeated compressions and relaxations in the refiner. The energy consumption to a given freeness was found to be considerably larger for Scots Pine than for Norway Spruce. However, the fibre transverse dimensions did not differ much between Norway Spruce and Scots Pine. Pine pulps were far less developed than spruce pulps at similar energy level. A possible explanation for the large energy consumption may be that redistribution of extractives at the fibre surface could reduce friction in the refiner. This hypothesis should be further explored. The results in this study improve the knowledge of which fibre parameters that matter for surface smoothness and opacity of wood-containing publication paper. Further, this study elucidates how important fibre parameters such as wall thickness and fibre splitting are altered during a refining process. The results may be utilized to identify possible ways of modifying the TMP-process in order to produce paper with improved surface smoothness and opacity. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to improve the understanding on how thermal treatments of mechanical pulps containing iron influence the unbleached brightness and hydrogen peroxide bleachability at high brightness levels. An unbleached Norway spruce stone <b>groundwood</b> (SGW) <b>pulp</b> was subjected to heat and iron (Fe 3 +) treatments followed by a chelating stage and a high consistency hydrogen peroxide bleaching stage. The hydrogen peroxide bleachability was studied on pulps {{as a function of}} pre-treatment at elevated temperatures and strongly bound iron content prior to bleaching and the alkali charge during bleaching. The evaluation was done using an experimental design based on the MODDE software (Umetrics AB). Heat treatment of the unbleached SGW pulp at 110 or 140 degrees C did not induce a significant increase in light absorption coefficient. Increasing the heat treatment temperature to 170 degrees C did, however, result in an increased light absorption coefficient corresponding to a brightness loss of 3. 5 % ISO. The light scattering coefficient was found to be essentially unchanged regardless of the heat-treatment conditions applied. The brightness loss resulting from the heat treatment could only partly be regained by hydrogen peroxide bleaching. An increased amount of strongly bound iron in the unbleached SGW pulp increased the light absorption coefficient. This increase was slightly higher when heat pre-treatment was performed at 140 and 170 degrees C compared to when heating at 110 degrees C.  Hydrogen peroxide bleaching was found to reduce the iron content of the pulps and thus regain some of the brightness that was lost. This effect was most pronounced at the higher alkali charge levels. It is thus important to minimise the processing temperature, the time at high temperature and the iron content of the pulp in order to improve the unbleached brightness and bleachability of mechanical pulps...|$|R
40|$|A major {{environmental}} concern {{with respect to}} hydrocarbon emissions is the formation of phytotoxic photooxidants. The work reported in this thesis focusses on the poorly studied anthropogenic terpene emissions from the industrial use of softwood. The advanced analytical determinations were made by adsorption sampling followed by thermal desorption and gas chromatography in the laboratory. Monoterpenes from forestry were analyzed for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). Near to a harvester, the total monoterpene concentrations reached ~ 1000 mg/m 3, whereas the background level was ~ 1 mg/m 3. Prominent monoterpenes were a-pinene, b-pinene, 3 -carene, camphene, limonene, b-phellandrene, myrcene and terpinolene. Local formation of phytotoxic photooxidants may occur because of the short lifetimes of terpenes in air. Terpenes in process emissions and plumes from kraft pulp industries {{were found to have}} a uniform composition similar to that of pulpwood and of recovered sulphate turpentine. Predominant monoterpenes were a-pinene and 3 -carene from Scots pine. The emitted terpenes give rise to photooxidants and to oxidation of co-emitted sulphur and nitrogen oxides. The monoterpenes in emissions from industries producing stone <b>groundwood</b> and thermomechanical <b>pulp</b> were similar in composition to that of the processed pulpwood from Norway spruce. The major monoterpenes were a-pinene (> 50 %) and b-pinene (~ 25 %). The process emissions from a sulphite mill consisted mainly of p-cymene, formed from spruce monoterpenes by acid rearrangements. The terpene emissions from the barking of timber and pulpwood differed somewhat in composition from that of the wood. Increased proportions of b-phellandrene and myrcene were observed for Norway spruce.

40|$|Mechanical pulps {{are used}} in paper {{products}} such as magazine or news grade printing papers or paperboard. Mechanical pulping gives a high yield; nearly everything in the tree except the bark {{is used in the}} paper. This means that mechanical pulping consumes much less wood than chemical pulping, especially to produce a unit area of printing surface. A drawback of mechanical pulp production is the high amounts of electrical energy needed to separate and refine the fibers to a given fiber quality. Mechanical pulps are often produced from slow growing spruce trees of forests in the northern hemisphere resulting in long, slender fibers that are well suited for mechanical pulp products. These fibers have large varieties in geometry, mainly wall thickness and width, depending on seasonal variations and growth conditions. Earlywood fibers typically have thin walls and latewood fibers thick. The background to this study was that a more detailed fiber characterization involving evaluations of distributions of fiber characteristics, may give improved possibilities to optimize the mechanical pulping process and thereby reduce the total electric energy needed to reach a given quality of the pulp and final product. This would result in improved competitiveness as well as less environmental impact. This study evaluated the relation between fiber characteristics in three types of mechanical pulps made from Norway spruce (Picea abies), thermomechanical pulp(TMP), stone <b>groundwood</b> <b>pulp</b> (SGW) and chemithermomechanical pulp (CTMP). In addition, the influence of fibers from these pulp types on sheet characteristics, mainly tensile index, was studied. A comparatively rapid method was presented on how to evaluate the propensity of each fiber to form sheets of high tensile index, by the use of raw data from a commercially available fiber analyzer (FiberLabTM). The developed method gives novel opportunities of evaluating the effect on the fibers of each stage in the mechanical pulping process and has a potential to be applied also on‐line to steer the refining and pulping process by the characteristics of the final pulp {{and the quality of the}} final paper. The long fiber fraction is important for the properties of the whole pulp. It was found that fiber wall thickness and external fibrillation were the fibercharacteristics that contributed the most to tensile index of the long fiber fractions in five mechanical pulps (three TMPs, one SGW, one CTMP). The tensile index of handsheets of the long fiber fractions could be predicted by linear regressions using a combination of fiber wall thickness and degree of external fibrillation. The predicted tensile index was denoted BIN, short for Bonding ability INfluence. This resulted in the same linear correlation between BIN and tensile index for 52 samples of the five mechanical pulps studied, each fractionated into five streams(plus feed) in full size hydrocyclones. The Bauer McNett P 16 /R 30 (passed 16 meshwire, retained on a 30 mesh wire) and P 30 /R 50 fractions of each stream were used for the evaluation. The fibers of the SGW had thicker walls and a higher degree of external fibrillation than the TMPs and CTMP, which resulted in a correlation between BIN and tensile index on a different level for the P 30 /R 50 fraction of SGW than the other pulp samples. A BIN model based on averages weighted by each fiber´s wall volume instead of arithmetic averages, took the fiber wall thickness of the SGW into account, and gave one uniform correlation between BIN and tensile index for all pulp samples (12 samples for constructing the model, 46 for validatingit). If the BIN model is used for predicting averages of the tensile index of a sheet, a model based on wall volume weighted data is recommended. To be able to produce BIN distributions where the influence of the length or wall volume of each fiber is taken into account, the BIN model is currently based on arithmetic averages of fiber wall thickness and fibrillation. Fiber width used as a single factor reduced the accuracy of the BIN model. Wall volume weighted averages of fiber width also resulted in a completely changed ranking of the five hydrocyclone streams compared to arithmetic, for two of thefive pulps. This was not seen when fiber width was combined with fiber wallthickness into the factor “collapse resistance index”. In order to avoid too high influence of fiber wall thickness and until the influence of fiber width on BIN and the measurement of fiber width is further evaluated, it is recommended to use length weighted or arithmetic distributions of BIN and other fiber characteristics. A comparably fast method to evaluate the distribution of fiber wall thickness and degree of external fibrillation with high resolution showed that the fiber wallthickness of the latewood fibers was reduced by increasing the refining energy in adouble disc refiner operated at four levels of specific energy input in a commercial TMP production line. This was expected but could not be seen by the use of average values, it was concluded that fiber characteristics in many cases should be evaluated as distributions and not only as averages. BIN distributions of various types of mechanical pulps from Norway spruce showed results that were expected based on knowledge of the particular pulps and processes. Measurements of mixtures of a news‐ and a SC (super calendered) gradeTMP, showed a gradual increase in high‐BIN fibers with higher amounts of SCgrade TMP. The BIN distributions also revealed differences between the pulps that were not seen from average fiber values, for example that the shape of the BINdistributions was similar for two pulps that originated from conical disc refiners, a news grade TMP and the board grade CTMP, although the distributions were on different BIN levels. The SC grade TMP and the SC grade SGW had similar levels of tensile index, but the SGW contained some fibers of very low BIN values which may influence the characteristics of the final paper, for example strength, surface and structure. This shows that the BIN model has the potential of being applied on either the whole or parts of a papermaking process based on mechanical or chemimechanical pulping; the evaluation of distributions of fiber characteristics can contribute to increased knowledge about the process and opportunities to optimize it...|$|R
