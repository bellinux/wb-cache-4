40|$|At present, {{there are}} {{significant}} reactive power flows in the Sri Lankan power system, giving rise to excessive network losses, creating <b>under</b> <b>voltage</b> conditions and limiting the utilization of transmission line and transformer capacities. This undesirable flow of reactive power through the network can be reduced by generating reactive power {{as close as possible}} to the loads; at least at grid substation level. Capacitor banks can be used for reactive power compensation and voltage support in grid substations as it is a comparatively inexpensive source of reactive power. Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has some amount of breaker switched capacitor banks installed at several grid substations.
