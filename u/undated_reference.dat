It was in Brindisi/Plandarsin that Rabbis Gamliel, Akiva, and other Tannaim debate oral law concerning personal travel during Shabbat.|$|E
5000|$|Melville {{states that}} he did the {{engraving}} for the United States stamp with the portrait of Washington. The Art of the Print webpage seems to put the engraving of the stamp before 1823. In the book by Fielding there is an <b>undated</b> <b>reference</b> to a book illustration by Humphrys called [...] "Early days of Washington". In a report in The New York Times of 18 June 1922 A Hatfield Jr is quoted from his book [...] "There are indications which lead me to the opinion that the engraver was no other than that gifted British artist William Humphrys .... in his obituary notice in The Art Journal (1865) it is stated that he engraved the portrait of Washington for United States stamps. This might have referred to the first Government issue of 1847, but, if so, the same printers printed the 1845 New York stamps and the 1847 United States Government issue and may have employed the same engraver." [...] It should be remembered that Humphrys moved to Dublin in 1845.|$|E
5000|$|Challenge dances usually {{employed}} three judges. One sat on {{the stage}} and counted time, another sat in or near the orchestra pit and judged style, and the third went under the stage and observed the dancer's execution to listen for [...] "missing taps, defective rolls and heel work, the lagging in the breaks". [...] After the dance, they compared notes and chose the winner. Audience members and friends of the competitors bet on the outcome and could name the victor by popular acclaim in the case the judges could not come to a decision. According to an <b>undated</b> <b>reference</b> by Leavitt, Juba lost one challenge, at the Boylston Gardens in Boston, but records show that he beat Diamond in all other competitions. An undated clipping from the Harvard Theatre Collection, written by a fan of minstrelsy, describes the single dance competition that Diamond managed to win: [...] "One of the fiddlers played a reel for him Juba, and he shuffled, and twisted, and walked around, and danced on for one hour and fifteen minutes by the watch." [...] Then Juba made a loud strike with his left foot as the crowd cheered and he got a drink from the bar. Diamond was next and tried to act cool but resolute. He knew that he would displease Barnum by losing and he had his race at stake: [...] "There was another thing about this match-dance that made Diamond want to win. You see it was not only a case of Barnum's Museum against Pete Williams's dance-house, but {{it was a case of}} white against black. So Jack Diamond went at his dancin' with double energyâ€”first, for his place, next, for his color." [...] He beat Juba's time and [...] "gave a hop, skip and a jump, a yell and a bow". A black man shouted out, [...] "He's a white man, sure ... but he's got a nigger in his heel." [...] The two had their most famous matchup in New York City in 1844, where Juba beat Diamond for $500. Juba then traveled to Boston, billing himself as the [...] "King of All the Dancers", and played for two weeks, with competitions versus Frank Diamond (no relation to John).|$|E

40|$|A global aerosol {{climatology}} {{is evolving}} from the NASA satellite experiments SAM II, SAGE I, and SAGE II. In addition, {{polar stratospheric cloud}} (PSC) data have been obtained from these experiments over the last decade. An <b>undated</b> <b>reference</b> model of the optical characteristics of the background aerosol is described and a new aerosol reference model derived from the latest available data is proposed. The aerosol models are referenced to the height above the tropopause. The impact {{of a number of}} volcanic eruptions is described. In addition, a model describing the seasonal, longitudinal, and interannual variations in PSCs is presented...|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss the}} use of multivariate kernel {{smoothing}} methods to date manuscripts dating from the 11 th to the 15 th centuries, in the English county of Essex. The dataset consists of some 3300 dated and 5000 undated manuscripts, and the former are used as a training sample for imputing dates for the latter. It is assumed that two manuscripts that are ``close'', {{in a sense that}} may be defined by a vector of measures of distance for documents, will have close dates. Using this approach, statistical ideas are used to assess ``similarity'', by smoothing among distance measures, and thus to estimate dates for the 5000 <b>undated</b> manuscripts by <b>reference</b> to the dated ones.

50|$|In 2007 Professor Kenneth A. Kitchen {{argued that}} the {{combination}} of Late Ramesside Letter 41 (<b>undated)</b> with a <b>reference</b> to a Year 12 in West Theban graffito No.1393 (which mentioned the necropolis scribe Ankhefenamun visiting the mountains with the senior scribe Butehamun, Dhutmose's son) likely shows that the Whm Mswt reached a Year 12 or Year 30 proper of Ramesses XI.However, Kitchen's own standard book on the Third Intermediate Period previously attributed the anonymous West Theban graffito No.1393 to the reign of king Smendes and not to the Whm Mswt period. Attributing this date to the Whm Mswt would create enormous problems for his own reconstruction of Egyptian history since West Theban graffito No.1393 forms part of a whole corpus of sources which Kitchen would never be willing to ascribe to the Whm Mswt since this would upset his whole chronology for the period.|$|R
