40|$|INTRODUCTION: General {{practitioners}} (GPs) and <b>urologists</b> are {{the first}} medical contacts for men with sexual dysfunction. Previous {{studies have shown that}} many GPs hesitate to address sexual issues and {{little is known about the}} sexological skills of <b>urologists.</b> AIM: To analyze sexual history taking (SHT) by Swiss GPs and <b>urologists,</b> in terms of active exploration, focus, and competence in discussing and treating sexual dysfunction. METHODS: A semi-structured interview was developed and used in face-to-face encounters with 25 GPs and 25 <b>urologists.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Content and frequency of interview responses. RESULTS: <b>Urologists</b> reported a significantly higher frequency of actively asking male patients about sexual dysfunction (22. 80 % vs. 10. 42 %, P = 0. 01). GPs and <b>urologists</b> avoided actively asking certain patient groups about sexual dysfunction (e. g., "immigrants,""macho men"). GPs reported a significantly lower percentage of male patients who spontaneously address sexual problems (6. 35 % vs. 18. 40 %, P > 0. 001). Both physician groups emphasized erectile dysfunction in SHT. Eight percent of GPs and 28 % of <b>urologists</b> considered their competence in discussing sexual dysfunction as very good. No GP and 20 % of <b>urologists</b> considered their competence in treating sexual dysfunction as very good. <b>Urologists</b> reported having significantly greater competence in discussing (P = 0. 02) and treating (P > 0. 001) sexual dysfunction than the GPs. Competence in discussing correlated positively with competence in treating sexual dysfunction for GPs (P = 0. 01) and <b>urologists</b> (P > 0. 001). The majority of GPs (92 %) and <b>urologists</b> (76 %) reported a need for continuing education in sexual issues. CONCLUSIONS: Our results justify establishing guidelines for SHT in Switzerland to better meet the sexual health needs of male patients. Physicians should be encouraged to routinely inquire about sexual issues, overcome their discomfort with the subject, and regard male sexuality as more than erectile function. A clear need exists for relevant continuing education for Swiss GPs and <b>urologists...</b>|$|R
40|$|By {{means of}} a questionnaire, all Dutch <b>urologists</b> (n = 250, 136 responded) and {{regional}} general practitioners (GPs; n = 400, 176 responded) were contacted concerning current diagnostics and treatment modalities applied in patients with prostatitis syndromes. The patients seen by <b>urologists</b> seem to be younger (30 - 40 years) and they mostly complain of pain in the perineum, penis or scrotum, while GPs see older patients (> 40 years) mainly presenting with micturition complaints. <b>Urologists</b> think nonbacterial causes (40 %) most important, while GPs mention bacterial infections (63 %) {{as the most important}} cause. The first choice of therapy is antibiotics, mostly co-trimoxazole Sulfatrim for 3 weeks, but patients seen by <b>urologists</b> are more resistant to this therapy.

25|$|If {{cancer is}} suspected, a biopsy is offered expediently. During a biopsy a <b>urologist</b> or {{radiologist}} obtains tissue {{samples from the}} prostate via the rectum. A biopsy gun inserts and removes special hollow-core needles (usually three to six {{on each side of}} the prostate) in less than a second. Prostate biopsies are routinely done on an outpatient basis and rarely require hospitalization. Antibiotics should be used to prevent complications like fever, urinary tract infections, and sepsis. Fifty-five percent of men report discomfort during prostate biopsy.|$|E

25|$|By the 1960s, CAH {{was well}} understood, {{karyotyping}} was routine, and standard management was to assign and raise all children with CAH {{according to their}} gonads and karyotypes, no matter how virilized.

40|$|To {{analyze the}} current {{management}} recommendations among French-speaking physicians treating infants with antenatal renal pelvis dilatation, we surveyed 83 pediatric nephrologists and 68 pediatric <b>urologists</b> by questionnaire. A total of 45 (54 %) pediatric nephrologists and 38 (56 %) pediatric <b>urologists</b> responded. The threshold for {{the diagnosis of}} abnormal fetal renal pelvis dilatation was significantly higher among pediatric <b>urologists</b> than nephrologists. All responders perform renal ultrasound examinations after birth. Postnatal renal pelvis dilatation was considered abnormal if the anteroposterior diameter was ≥ 11 ± 1. 9 mm by the pediatric <b>urologists</b> and ≥ 9 ± 2. 9 mm by the pediatric nephrologists (P= 0. 003). Pediatric <b>urologists</b> {{were more likely than}} nephrologists to recommend routine voiding cystourethrography [41 % versus 20 % (P= 0. 04) ]. Mercaptoacetyl-triglycine renography was the most routinely used tool to achieve functional evaluation during follow-up among the responders. Pediatric <b>urologists</b> were more likely to recommend surgical treatment in dilated kidneys with initial function < 40 %. In conclusion, pediatric <b>urologists</b> had significantly higher thresholds for the detection of prenatal and neonatal renal pelvis dilatation. They also more frequently recommended routine voiding cystourethrography and surgical therapy of dilated kidneys with low function than pediatric nephrologists. The variability in attitudes is most probably due to the absence of clear guidelines based on prospective and controlled trials. © IPNA 2004. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
30|$|Several {{prior studies}} have {{assessed}} practice {{patterns in the}} management of adolescent varicocele using surveys. Richter et al. (2001) reported on questionnaire responses by 99 pediatric <b>urologists</b> and 75 <b>urologists</b> with infertility training. Of the pediatric <b>urologists</b> surveyed, the preferred surgical approaches were inguinal (41.4  %), subinguinal (29.3  %), retroperitoneal Palomo (19.9  %), and laparoscopic (14.4  %). Use of the operating microscope was reported by 30  % of pediatric <b>urologists</b> surveyed. In a more recent survey of 131 pediatric <b>urologists,</b> Pastuszak et al. (2014) reported that the preferred surgical approaches were laparoscopic (38  %), subinguinal microsurgical (28  %), inguinal (14  %), and open Palomo (13  %). Of those <b>urologists</b> who used an open surgical approach, 60  % used loupe magnification, and 40  % used an operating microscope. The authors note that when comparing their survey results to those by Richter et al. (2001), the evaluation and management of pediatric varicocele appears to have remained stable over the past decade, with a shift toward increasing use of a laparoscopic technique. This shift likely reflects an increasing comfort level with the laparoscopic technique among more recent trainees rather than demonstration of superiority of the approach.|$|R
40|$|Background: Overactive bladder (OAB) is a {{clinical}} syndrome consisting of symptom complex of urgency, {{with or without}} incontinence which has significant effects on {{quality of life and}} has to be managed properly. The aim {{of this study was to}} review the management of OAB by Indonesian <b>urologists.</b> Methods: A self-constructed questionnaires containing diagnostic and treatment options of OAB patients were distributed to Indonesian <b>urologists.</b> This was a cross-sectional study and descriptive analysis method was used to analyze the data. Results: 129 Indonesian <b>urologists</b> participated in this study. Most of them faced more than 20 OAB cases per year with the most common type was OAB without incontinence or dry OAB (57. 4 %). Most <b>urologists</b> (34. 1 %) ordered at least three diagnostic tools to determine OAB. They were bladder diary, urinalysis and scoring system. The most used scoring system (48. 9 %) was the overactive bladder symptoms score (OABSS). Thirty-five point seven percents (35. 7 %) of <b>urologists</b> used antimuscarinic and behavioral therapy as initial therapy. Solifenacin 5 mg/day was the most common antimuscarinic prescribed as the first line therapy (48 %).

25|$|On a basic level, radiographers do not {{generally}} interpret diagnostic media, rather they evaluate media {{and make a}} decision about its diagnostic effectiveness. In order to make this evaluation radiographers must have a comprehensive but not necessarily exhaustive knowledge of pathology and radiographic appearances; {{it is for this reason}} that radiographers often do not interpret or diagnose without further training. Notwithstanding, it is now becoming more common that radiographers have an extended and expanded clinical role, this includes a role in initial radiological diagnosis, diagnosis consultation and what subsequent investigations to conduct.

25|$|While {{all these}} {{surgical}} advances were taking place, many important developments were also {{taking place in}} the science of optics. Many new optical instruments with medical applications were invented during the 19th century. In 1805, a German army surgeon named Philipp von Bozzini (1773–1809) invented a device he called the lichtleiter (or light-guiding instrument). This instrument, the ancestor of the modern endoscope, was used to examine the urethra, the human urinary bladder, rectum, oropharynx and nasopharynx. The instrument consisted of a candle within a metal chimney; a mirror on the inside reflected light from the candle through attachments into the relevant body cavity. The practice of gastric endoscopy in humans was pioneered by United States Army surgeon William Beaumont (1785–1853) in 1822 with the cooperation of his patient Alexis St. Martin (1794–1880), a victim of an accidental gunshot wound to the stomach. In 1853, Antonin Jean Desormeaux (1815–1882) of Paris modified Bozzini's lichtleiter such that a mirror would reflect light from a kerosene lamp through a long metal channel. Referring to this instrument as an endoscope (he is credited with coining this term), Desormeaux employed it to examine the urinary bladder. However, like Bozzini's lichtleiter, Desormeaux's endoscope was of limited utility due to its propensity to become very hot during use. In 1868, Adolph Kussmaul (1822–1902) of Germany performed the first esophagogastroduodenoscopy (a diagnostic procedure in which an endoscope is used to visualize the esophagus, stomach and duodenum) on a living human. The subject was a sword-swallower, who swallowed a metal tube with a length of 47 centimeters and a diameter of 13 millimeters. On 2 October 1877, Berlin <b>urologist</b> Maximilian Carl-Friedrich Nitze (1848–1906) and Viennese instrument maker Josef Leiter (1830–1892) introduced the first practical cystourethroscope with an electric light source. The instrument's biggest drawback was the tungsten filament incandescent light bulb (invented by Alexander Lodygin, 1847–1923), which became very hot and required a complicated water cooling system. In 1881, Polish physician Jan Mikulicz-Radecki (1850–1905) created the first rigid gastroscope for practical applications.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the feasibility of}} obtaining cooperation from <b>urologists</b> in carrying out large-scale studies on the efficacy of acupuncture {{for the treatment of}} urological conditions, based on urologists' general views and knowledge of acupuncture. METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed to 145 <b>urologists</b> within three training deaneries within England. RESULTS: A response rate of 70 % (n= 102) was achieved. The majority of <b>urologists</b> rated their knowledge of acupuncture as low (46 %, n= 46) and their general attitude towards acupuncture was neutral (54 %, n= 55). The majority of responding <b>urologists</b> (95 %) thought that acupuncture may be of value in urological conditions, and acupuncture was suggested to patients by 30 <b>urologists</b> (29 %). The <b>urologists</b> most likely to suggest acupuncture to their patients were typically over 40 years of age, more experienced, not in a training post, and since starting their urological career had changed their attitude towards acupuncture. In a multivariate analysis, a change of view regarding the efficacy of acupuncture was found to be the only variable significantly associated with a recommendation of acupuncture to patients.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Male sexual {{dysfunction}} {{is a common}} medical condition, which is addressed mainly from a biomedical perspective by Swiss general practitioners (GPs) and <b>urologists</b> as the results of part I of our study showed. A psychosocial orientation in sexual history taking (SHT) leads to a truly patient-centered approach and is crucial for improving therapy decisions related to {{sexual dysfunction}}. AIM: To analyze to what extent Swiss GPs and <b>urologists</b> have a psychosocial orientation in SHT, and what therapeutic options they focus on when confronted with male sexual dysfunction. METHODS: A semistructured interview was developed and used in face-to-face encounters with 25 GPs and 25 <b>urologists.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Content and frequency of interview responses. RESULTS: The GPs and <b>urologists</b> differed significantly {{from each other in}} 5 out of 22 psychosocial factors. Summarizing these psychosocial factors in four domains showed a difference between the GPs and <b>urologists</b> in only one domain. Both groups focus on an open conversation as their approach in SHT. No GP and only a minority of <b>urologists</b> based their diagnosis on criteria of the International Classification of Diseases (10 th edition) (ICD- 10) or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4 th edition) (DSM-IV). The GPs and <b>urologists</b> differed significantly from each other in 4 out of 16 combinations resulting from the given therapeutic options and form of sexual dysfunction. The <b>urologists</b> focus more strongly on medication as a therapeutic option. CONCLUSIONS: The results of part II additionally justify establishing guidelines and training resources related to SHT in Switzerland. Swiss physicians should be encouraged to apply a more psychosocial orientation in SHT. This will contribute to a better patient-centered approach with positive consequences on physicians' therapeutic decisions. Optimizing the approach in SHT and the choice of therapeutic options may better facilitate real sexual satisfaction for the patient and ultimately result in fewer health insurance costs...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{prostatitis}} {{has been}} a perplexing problem for <b>urologists</b> for decades. This review explores the perils and pitfalls <b>urologists</b> encounter with epidemiology, etiology, classification, diagnosis, and treatment of this syndrome. The major question involves the problem of developing rational treatment plans for patients with a medical condition associated with genitourinary pain, variable voiding, and sexual dysfunction but no obvious and accepted etiology. Exciting, innovative, ongoing research does offer some solutions and management strategies that <b>urologists</b> can even now incorporate into their practice {{while waiting for the}} fundamental questions to be answered...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{associations between}} {{the level of}} shared care and the clinical management of patients with uncomplicated lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey study was conducted comprising all <b>urologists</b> and a random selection of general practitioners (GPs) in the Netherlands. Questionnaire responses were obtained from 182 <b>urologists</b> (70 %) and 261 GPs (55 %). The {{first part of the}} questionnaire established the physicians' characteristics and the second the level of familiarity with the national shared-care guidelines, arrangements between <b>urologists</b> and GPs, and the availability of a shared-care prostate clinic. The third part presented a written case of a 50 -year-old man with clinical uncomplicated LUTS, and asked questions about diagnostic and therapeutic care. RESULTS: The clinical management of LUTS by GPs and <b>urologists</b> differed, particularly for diagnostic procedures. Only a minority of GPs (8 %) and <b>urologists</b> (18 %) had a shared-care clinic at their disposal. Such clinics were associated with an increase in tests ordered by the GP, e. g. creatinine levels (odds ratio, OR 3. 83) and PSA levels (OR 5. 93), and a decrease in choosing a watchful-waiting strategy for patients with mild symptoms (OR 0. 24). Furthermore, <b>urologists</b> more often chose surgical intervention for moderate symptoms (OR 9. 80). CONCLUSION: A shared-care clinic may lead to a shift in primary care towards the working style of <b>urologists.</b> This healthcare may not be as cost-effective as expected by policy makers. Prospective studies are needed to provide better insight in the health outcomes and efficiency of shared-care clinics...|$|R
