5|$|Another Trojan in this wave, TorrentLocker, {{initially}} {{contained a}} design flaw comparable to CryptoDefense; it <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> keystream for every infected computer, making the encryption trivial to overcome.

5|$|Several design {{proposals}} were submitted, all calling for heavy main guns, between 30.5cm(12in) and 34.3cm(13.5in) calibers.
