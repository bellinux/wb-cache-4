40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{behavior}} of fully grouted, <b>untensioned</b> <b>cable</b> bolts and their application to the stabilization of underground openings are investigated. The study program undertaken involves field, laboratory and numerical studies which aim to improve {{understanding of the role}} of passive cable bolting in rock mass support. The higher residual load carrying capacity of the cable and the grout-aggregate mix is compared with that of the conventional grout (cement + water). Based on the variational approach, an analytical model has been developed to calculate the distribution of shear bond stress along the embedded length of a cable bolt. A parametric study is then undertaken to illustrate the support behavior of cable bolts with different grout compositions. A special finite element for the cable bolt was formulated and integrated into existing finite element code called MSAP 2 D, in order to allow the simulation of cable bolts in underground excavations. A practical example is presented to demonstrate the effect of cable bolts on the stability of the opening. The simulation is carried out using the newly developed numerical model with cable bolt simulation capability...|$|E
