40|$|Abstract — We {{introduce}} and formally define all-but-k mercurial commitments, a {{new kind}} cryptographic commitment that generalizes standard mercurial and non-mercurial (vector) commitments. We provide two concrete constructions for all-but-k mercurial commitments: the first is for committing to <b>unordered</b> <b>lists</b> (i. e., to multisets) {{and the second is}} for committing to ordered lists (i. e., to vectors). Both of our constructions build on Kate et al. ’s polynomial commitments, leveraging the algebraic structure of polynomials to fine tune the ordinary binding property of mercurial commitments. To facilitate these constructions, we give novel zero-knowledge protocols for 1) proving knowledge of a point on a committed polynomial, 2) arguing knowledge of the committed polynomial itself, and 3) arguing that a committed polynomial has degree at most k...|$|R

Some typical programming constructs that one might employ in Roomy are: map, reduce, duplicate elimination, chain reduction, pair reduction, and breadthfirst search. All aspects of parallelism and remote I/O are hidden within the Roomy library...|$|R

30|$|Concepts to be {{realised}} as noun phrases (either {{filling in}} Agent or Patient {{positions in the}} sentence template) are <b>unordered</b> <b>lists</b> of nouns, proper names, adjectives and prepositional phrases (PPs). The PP surface forms may be computed recursively during generation but, for reasons of computational efficiency, these constituents are presently assumed to be computed in advance. In other words, they are assumed to appear already in their final surface form (regarding both inflection and order) in the input specification. Although this may in principle {{be seen as a}} limitation of our approach, in practice nearly all (over 99  %) noun phrases in our test corpus (newspapers headlines, cf. Sect.  4) have at most two PP modifiers each, making their computation rather trivial. Concepts to be realised as VPs (filling in an Action position) are sets of verbs with accompanying prepositions and adverbial modifiers.|$|R

Many algorithms are very well known for sorting the <b>unordered</b> <b>lists.</b> In this proposed algorithm, we suggested a new algorithm for sorting integers number depending on dividing the input array to many sub-arrays (which represents a vector or array with one dimension), according to the number of digits in each integer number, the relation between sub-array elements is determined, and this relation used to determines the right location of each element in sub-arrays. Collision may happen, which is solved by moving elements in sub-array to next location. Finally, all ordered sub-arrays will be merged together to rebuild the origin array. The proposed algorithm compared with many famous algorithms gives promising results...|$|R
