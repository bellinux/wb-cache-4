25|$|The opening Test at Brisbane has {{a history}} of having {{important}} psychological effects on the teams. The four England teams before ours had all lost there. Even Len Hutton's eventually victorious side went down there by an innings. We drew the match and I believe this was the turning point of our tour. Nobody expected <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out of it with our pride intact.|$|E

Yet the reader is struck by the fact that even as we read her final request, we know it goes un-honored. This has a further social implication on the silencing of marginalized cultures and, additionally, women.|$|E

500|$|Badmotorfinger {{has been}} {{classified}} by various critics as grunge, alternative metal, heavy metal and hard rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic {{said that the}} songwriting on the album [...] "takes a quantum leap in focus and consistency". He added, [...] "It's surprisingly cerebral and arty music for a band courting mainstream metal audiences, but it attacks with scientific precision." [...] Guitarist Kim Thayil jokingly called it the [...] "Heavy Metal White Album". Cornell said, [...] "I think there's songs on the new record which are almost more commercially viable because they have that memorable feel to them, and I think if anyone expected <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out and make something more commercial than Louder Than Love, then I'm glad that they were surprised." [...] Cornell also added that the album was more representative of how the band was live. Shepherd contributed the song [...] "Somewhere" [...] and collaborated on the musical composition of several other songs on the album. Thayil said that Shepherd's contributions helped make the album [...] "faster" [...] and [...] "weirder".|$|E
500|$|Henry {{scored two}} late goals in Arsenal’s victory over Birmingham City on 4 December 2004. Wenger {{replaced}} Lehmann in goal with Almunia, {{who made his}} league debut. Arsenal then faced league leaders Chelsea at Highbury; the match was billed as [...] "Judgement Day" [...] by Sky Sports. With Vieira suspended and Gilberto and Edu injured, Wenger picked Flamini to partner Fabregas in midfield. The first chance of the match went to Henry, who scored inside 75 seconds. John Terry levelled the score, but Henry restored Arsenal’s lead from a contentious free-kick – Graham Poll allowed the striker to take it quickly without warning the Chelsea players. Eiður Guðjohnsen equalised {{early in the second}} half for Chelsea, and late on Henry missed a chance to score a hat-trick. There were no further goals and the match ended 2–2, meaning Chelsea remained five points clear of Arsenal. Wenger said he was disappointed in the manner his team conceded to Chelsea – from two set pieces, but added, [...] "I thought we did really well, and it was important for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back to the level we want to be at." ...|$|E

[...] They played several tracks from their upcoming album, at that point entitled It's What's Not There That Makes What's There What It Is. By May, it had been renamed to Paper Scissors Stone.

500|$|Although Dannemann {{stated that}} Hendrix was alive when {{placed in the}} {{ambulance}} at approximately 11:30a.m. and that she rode {{with him on the}} way to the hospital, the ambulance crew later denied she was there. Statements from the paramedics who responded to the call support that they found Hendrix alone in the flat when they arrived at 11:27a.m., fully clothed and apparently already dead. Jones later commented: [...] " [...] we arrived at the flat, the door was flung wide open, nobody about, just the body on the bed." [...] Saua stated: [...] "There was just me and the casualty and Reg the driver. Nobody else." [...] Burdon stated: [...] " [...] didn't leave in the ambulance; she was with me". According to Jones, Hendrix's bowels and bladder had released some of their contents prior to the ambulance crew's arrival at the Samarkand. Saua stated that the vomit was dry when they arrived, making use of their aspirator ineffective. Saua commented: [...] "When we moved , the gases were gurgling, you get that when someone has died". According to police officer Smith: [...] "The ambulance men were there, but Jimi was dead... There was really nothing they could do for him." [...] Smith also disputes Dannemann's claim that she was there with Hendrix at the flat and in the ambulance: No, I remember quite clearly the doors shutting on the crew and Jimi... there was no one about. If she had been in the flat, they would never have called <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>come...</b> But because no one was there, he was dead, and circumstances were a little odd, suspicious, they radioed... us in. It wasn't until later in the day that I found out that it was Jimi Hendrix. In 1992, after having conducted an extensive review of the events of September 18, 1970, the London Ambulance Service issued an official statement: [...] "There was no one else, except the deceased, at the flat when they arrived; nor did anyone else accompany them in the ambulance to St. Mary Abbotts Hospital." ...|$|E
