In fact, Thomas Rankin, co-founder and CEO of the program Dash Hudson, stated that when he approves a blogger's Instagram post before it is posted on the behalf of a brand his company represents, his only negative feedback is if it looks too posed.

For collecting data a qualitative method was used. Six librarians from three different libraries were elected for interviews. The result showed that public librarians generally had a positive attitude towards library marketing through Instagram. They wanted to show what the library could offer, establish their place in society and reach out to new users, and Instagram was a natural part of the marketing.
