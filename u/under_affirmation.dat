[...] Boston UniversityThe {{primary purpose}} of this study was to test the {{negation}} hypothesis in a clinical setting, and secondarily to test two hypotheses relating negation to defensiveness. More specifically this study was designed to demonstrate that the seeming pathology of negation responses is in fact significant of anxiety-association. 	Forty student nurses responded to a 20 -item Word Association test <b>under</b> <b>affirmation</b> and negation instructions. After a five week interval, their affirmation and negation responses, matched for length in letters and log frequency of occurrence in the English language, were used in a tachistoscopic recognition task. Practice effects in the tachistoscopic recognition task were controlled by splitting each subject's responses into a first half and a second half. Order of presentation of the affirmation and negation sets for the word association test was controlled by giving the affirmation set first to half the subjects, and the negation set first to the other half.

The California Penal Code allows for perjury to be a capital offense in cases causing wrongful execution. However, prosecutions for perjury are rare.

5000|$|In the law, {{testimony}} {{is a form}} of evidence that is obtained from a witness who makes a solemn statement or declaration of fact.

Unless a witness is testifying as an expert witness, testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is generally limited to those opinions or inferences that are rationally based on the perceptions of the witness and are helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony.|$|R
50|$|It {{seems that}} under the Nigerian Penal Code, for a witness to be prosecuted for giving false evidence, his {{testimony}} must be {{required by law to}} be on oath and, such testimony may be verbal or otherwise. But having regard to section 36 of the same Penal Code as noted earlier, evidence given <b>under</b> an <b>affirmation</b> or solemn declaration is also regarded as evidence given on oath. In interpreting the term ‘By an oath’ under section 191 of the Indian Penal Code, which has same wording with section 156 of the Penal Code, Thakore and Vakil apparently referring to an Indian court’s decision, argued that an oath or solemn affirmation is not a sine qua non to the offence of perjury or giving false evidence. This reasoning may be correct but it is submitted that such a person must either legally be bound by an oath or by express provision of the law to state the truth or must be bound by law to make declaration. If otherwise, it is doubtful if a court of justice under the Nigerian Penal Code jurisdiction can reasonably find an accused guilty for the offence of giving false evidence for statements not made under those circumstances.|$|R

50|$|A lie {{is a false}} {{statement}} to a person or group made by another person or group who knows {{it is not the}} whole truth, intentionally. A fabrication is a lie told when someone submits a statement as truth without knowing for certain whether or not it actually is true.

The statement might be partly true, the statement may be totally true but only part of the whole truth, or it may employ some deceptive element, such as improper punctuation, or double meaning, especially if the intent is to deceive, evade, blame, or misrepresent the truth. An honest lie (or confabulation) is defined by verbal statements or actions that inaccurately describe history, background, and present situations.

5000|$|The {{development}} of perjury {{law in the}} United States centers on United States v. Dunnigan, a seminal case that set out the parameters of perjury within United States law. The court uses the Dunnigan-based legal standard to determine if an accused person, [...] "Testifying <b>under</b> oath or <b>affirmation</b> violates this section if she gives false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, {{rather than as a}} result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory." [...] However, a defendant shown to be willfully ignorant may in fact be eligible for perjury prosecution. The Dunnigan distinction manifests its importance with regard to the relation between two component parts of perjury’s definition: in willfully giving a false statement, a person must understand that she is giving a false statement to be considered a perjurer under the Dunnigan framework. Deliberation {{on the part of the}} defendant is required for a statement to constitute perjury. Jurisprudential developments in the American law of perjury have revolved around the facilitation of [...] "perjury prosecutions and thereby enhance the reliability of testimony before federal courts and grand juries." [...] With this goal in mind, Congress has sometimes expanded the grounds on which an individual may be prosecuted for perjury, with section 1623 of the United States Code recognizing the utterance of two mutually incompatible statements as grounds for perjury indictment even if neither can unequivocally be proven false. However, the two statements must be so mutually incompatible that at least one must necessarily be false; it is irrelevant whether the false statement can be specifically identified from among the two. It thus falls on the government to show that a defendant (a) knowingly made a (b) false (c) material statement (d) under oath (e) in a legal proceeding. [...] These proceedings can be ancillary to normal court proceedings, and thus, even such menial interactions as bail hearings can qualify as protected proceedings under this statute.|$|R
40|$|Although it now covers {{more than}} court proceedings, the {{definition}} of perjury has not changed a great deal otherwise since the framing of the Constitution. Blackstone described it as "a crime committed when a lawful oath is administered, in some judicial proceeding, {{to a person who}} swears wilfully, absolutely and falsely, in a matter material to the issue or point in question. " There are three general federal perjury laws. One, 18 U. S. C. 1621, outlaws presenting material false statements under oath in federal official proceedings. A second, 18 U. S. C. 1623, bars presenting material false statements under oath before or ancillary to federal court or grand jury proceedings. A third, 18 U. S. C. 1622 (subornation of perjury), prohibits inducing or procuring another to commit perjury in violation of either Section 1621 or Section 1623. In most cases, the courts abbreviate their description of the elements and state that to prove perjury under Section 1623 the government must establish that the defendant "(1) knowingly made a (2) false (3) material declaration (4) under oath (5) in a proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury of the United States. " The courts generally favor the encapsulation from United States v. Dunnigan to describe the elements of Section 1621 : "A witness testifying <b>under</b> oath or <b>affirmation</b> violates this section if she gives false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory. " Section 1622 outlaws procuring or inducing another to commit perjury: "Whoever procures another to commit any perjury is guilty of subornation of perjury, and shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both", 18 U. S. C. 1622. The false statement statute, 18 U. S. C. 1001, is closely akin to the perjury statutes. It outlaws false statements in any matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency or department, a kind of perjury with oath prohibition.
