Edward berates his daughter for failing him, and Kelly learns that former Candidate Don Meisel and Ground Control commander Gordo Alonzo have both died battling angry displaced persons. She awkwardly reunites with her estranged son and lover from her Academy days. Edward hopes to eventually colonise the world ocean with a race of genetically modified humans.|$|E
25|$|Saturation diving lets divers {{live and}} work at depth for days or weeks at a time. After working in the water, divers are {{transferred}} in a closed diving bell to rest and live in a dry pressurized <b>underwater</b> <b>habitat</b> on the bottom or a saturation life support system of pressure chambers at the surface. Decompression {{at the end of}} the dive may take many days, but since it is done only once for a long period of exposure, rather than after each of many shorter exposures, the overall risk of decompression injury to the diver and the total time spent decompressing are reduced. This type of diving allows greater economy of work and enhanced safety, but the capital and running costs are high and the systems are expensive to transport. Mobility of the diver is restricted because of the umbilical.|$|E
25|$|In September 1967 MacInnis {{took part}} in a {{classified}} Ocean Systems mission aboard Deep Diver on the Grand Banks south of Newfoundland. A cable plow, rumored to be used for burying a strategic communications cable, had been lost in 400 feet of water. Two Navy divers had already been killed trying to recover it. MacInnis was one of a crew of four Ocean Systems personnel who unsuccessfully attempted to recover the cable plow using the submersible. The mission was called off due to rising winds, and Deep Diver was barely brought safely back aboard the Canadian Coast Guard vessel CCGS John Cabot. In 1968 MacInnis {{took part in}} a saturation dive aboard the Hydrolab <b>underwater</b> <b>habitat</b> with two other aquanauts, spending 50 hours at a depth of 50 feet, and in the search for the lost submarine USS Scorpion. In late 1968 and early 1969, MacInnis took part in salvage operations after the crash of Pan Am Flight 217 near Caracas, Venezuela.|$|E

In this context 'habitat' is generally used in a narrow sense to mean the interior and immediate exterior of the structure and its fixtures, but not its surrounding marine environment. Most early <b>underwater</b> <b>habitats</b> lacked regenerative systems for air, water, food, electricity, and other resources. However, recently some new <b>underwater</b> <b>habitats</b> allow for these resources to be delivered using pipes, or generated within the habitat, rather than manually delivered.|$|R

500|$|Saturation diving lets {{professional}} divers {{live and}} work under pressure for days or weeks at a time. After working in the water, the divers rest and live in a dry pressurised <b>underwater</b> <b>habitat</b> on the bottom or a saturation life support system of pressure chambers {{on the deck of}} a diving support vessel, oil platform or other floating platform at a similar pressure to the work depth. They are [...] transferred between the surface accommodation and the underwater workplace in a pressurised closed diving bell. Decompression {{at the end of the}} dive may take many days, but since it is done only once for a long period of exposure, rather than after each of many shorter exposures, the overall risk of decompression injury to the diver and the total time spent decompressing are reduced. This type of diving allows greater work efficiency and safety.|$|E
2500|$|In {{saturation}} diving, {{the divers}} {{live in a}} pressurized environment, {{which can be a}} saturation system or [...] "saturation spread", a hyperbaric environment on the surface, or an ambient pressure <b>underwater</b> <b>habitat.</b> This may be maintained for up to several weeks, and they are decompressed to surface pressure only once, {{at the end of their}} tour of duty. By limiting the number of decompressions in this way, the risk of decompression sickness is significantly reduced.|$|E

Sublimnos had an [...] "open hatch" [...] policy, allowing access to any diver with a legitimate reason to use the habitat. In July 1969 MacInnis attended the Apollo 11 launch at Cape Kennedy, then traveled to Tobermory, where he dived to Sublimnos and looked up through the water at the Moon at the very moment the astronauts were walking on it.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "saturation system", [...] "saturation complex" [...] or [...] "saturation spread" [...] {{typically}} comprises {{either an}} <b>underwater</b> <b>habitat</b> or a surface complex {{made up of}} a living chamber, transfer chamber and submersible decompression chamber, which is commonly referred to in commercial diving and military diving as the diving bell, PTC (personnel transfer capsule) or SDC (submersible decompression chamber). The system can be permanently placed on a ship or ocean platform, but is more commonly capable of being moved from one vessel to another by crane. [...] The entire system is managed from a control room ("van"), where depth, chamber atmosphere and other system parameters are monitored and controlled. The diving bell is the elevator or lift that transfers divers from the system to the work site. Typically, it is mated to the system utilizing a removable clamp and is separated from the system tankage bulkhead by a trunking space, a kind of tunnel, through which the divers transfer to and from the bell. At the completion of work or a mission, the saturation diving team is decompressed gradually back to atmospheric pressure by the slow venting of system pressure, at an average of [...] to [...] per day (schedules vary). Thus the process involves only one ascent, thereby mitigating the time-consuming and comparatively risky process of in-water, staged decompression normally associated with non-saturation ("mixed gas diving or sur-D O2") operations. More than one living chamber can be linked to the transfer chamber through trunking so that diving teams can be stored at different depths where this is a logistical requirement. An extra chamber van be fitted to transfer personnel {{into and out of the}} system while under pressure and to treat divers for decompression sickness if this should be necessary.|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedIn {{addition}} to {{many forms of}} land-based architecture in this world, there are several instances of <b>underwater</b> <b>habitats.</b> These habitats have implications for space exploration and extreme climates. Based on the research conducted for this thesis, twelve of these habitats are examined in the following chapters. Their uses range from allowing divers {{to spend more time}} underwater, studying the effects of global warming, and examining changes to underwater conditions which can effectively be examined near the oceanic shelf. Furthermore, ocean tide could provide energy of infinite sustainability. The reason it is sustainable is that tidal waves provide energy without pollution, and energy without limit. What these <b>underwater</b> <b>habitats</b> could do is facilitate constant monitoring of tidal action, and the savings on the cost of energy may be able to justify the cost of <b>underwater</b> <b>habitats,</b> especially since studies demonstrated that there is enough potential tidal wave energy for all needs. In the following case studies of <b>underwater</b> <b>habitats,</b> their uses have already been defined. What will be looked at in regards to the case studies is how they were built to sustain themselves under such conditions.
