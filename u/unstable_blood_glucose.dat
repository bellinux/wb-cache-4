40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: to {{identify}} {{evidence in the}} literature on the possible risk factors for the risk of <b>unstable</b> <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> diagnosis in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and to compare them with the risk factors described by NANDA International. Method: an integrative literature review guided by the question: what are the risk factors for <b>unstable</b> <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> level in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus? Primary studies were included whose outcomes were variations in glycemic levels, published in English, Portuguese or Spanish, in PubMed or CINAHL between 2010 and 2015. Results: altered levels of glycated hemoglobin, body mass index> 31 kg/m 2, previous history of hypoglycemia, cognitive deficit/dementia, autonomic cardiovascular neuropathy, comorbidities and weight loss corresponded to risk factors described in NANDA International. Other risk factors identified were: advanced age, black skin color, longer length of diabetes diagnosis, daytime sleepiness, macroalbuminuria, genetic polymorphisms, insulin therapy, use of oral antidiabetics, and use of metoclopramide, inadequate physical activity and low fasting glycemia. Conclusions: risk factors for the diagnosis, risk for <b>unstable</b> <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> level, for persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus were identified, and 42 % of them corresponded to those of NANDA International. These findings may contribute to the practice of clinical nurses in preventing the deleterious effects of glycemic variation...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> control and <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> {{monitoring}} {{in intensive care}} unit (ICU) patients: two important aspects of care for and monitoring of critically ill patients. While the precise targets of <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> control in ICU patients remain a matter of debate, currently many, if not all, critically ill patients are treated with insulin at some point during their stay in the ICU. Although many patients are currently treated with insulin, it could be that certain patient groups benefit more from <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> control than other patient groups. Several quality and safety metrics for <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> control are proposed to be used, among others the mean <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> level, the proportion of patients developing or samples showing dysglycemia, and glycemic variability. However, these metrics of quality and safety for <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> control are only partly, and frequently inconsistently used. <b>Blood</b> <b>glucose</b> levels are still monitored manually using point-of-care devices with significant inaccuracies. Manual <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> monitoring is not only time-and blood-consuming, but also bears the risk of incorrect adjustments of the insulin infusion rate.

This was a descriptive cross-sectional study, conducted based on information contained in the records of 112 elderly patients, admitted from January to July 2011, in a public teaching hospital of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais (Brazil). Results. 53 % of patients were female and were 70 years or older. The most common diseases that led to hospitalization were cardiac (31 %), neoplasms (22 %), lung (10 %) and vascular diseases (10 %). Only 44 % of the patients had a ND identified. After exclusion of repetitions, 36 different diagnosis labels were identified. The primary ND were: risk for infection (78 %), impaired physical mobility (69 %), risk for impaired skin integrity (59 %), risk for falls (57 %), imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements (57 %), risk for <b>unstable</b> <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> (51 %) and self-care deficit (51 %).

Corticosteroid is one of the effective therapy for OLP in reducing the sign and symptoms of this disease, but this therapy have a serious side effect, therefore to administering one must consider the patient’s systemic condition. We reported a case of OLP in 52 years old female patient who has no history of diabetes mellitus and unknown glucose level. Management of this patient included application of corticosteroid swish, topical 0. 05 % clobetasol propionate and 0, 1 % triamcinolone acetonide, antimycotics, improvement the oral hygiene status and referral to internal medicine specialist.

However, dietary intake is diverse across country contexts. This study aimed to compare the dietary intake, food patterns, and <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> among middle-aged adults living in urban and suburban areas in Mandalay city, Myanmar, and explore their relationships. Methods: A cross-sectional community-based study was conducted during June–November 2014. Adults aged 35 – 64 were randomly selected and requested to record all food they ate in a 4 -day diary. Fasting and 2 -hour postprandial <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> values were measured over two consecutive days. Dietary intakes were calculated in terms of energy, macronutrients, glycemic index, and glycemic load, and food patterns were identified by factor analysis. The relationships between food pattern, dietary intake, and <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> were assessed. Results: Of 440 participants, dietary intake between urban and suburban residents was significantly different. Six food patterns were identified. There {{was no difference in}} fasting and 2 -hour postprandial <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> between urban and suburban residents, but a strong correlation between fasting <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> and 2 -hour postprandial <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> was found (correlation coefficient= 0. 8).

Relationships between food patterns and <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> or abnormal <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> status were not found. Conclusion: Food patterns were associated with dietary intake, not with abnormal <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> status. Two-hour postprandial <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> was highly correlated with fasting <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> and may be used for identifying abnormal <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> status...|$|R
40|$|Glycemic {{control in}} {{postoperative}} cardiac patients {{is necessary to}} improve outcomes in wound infection and overall mortality. In recent years, clinical trials evaluating <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> control in critically ill patients advocated for intense <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> management and found {{a significant reduction in}} morbidity and mortality. Some organizations published recommendations regarding <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> management in critically ill patients reflecting this information.

40|$|Aim. To {{estimate}} {{dynamics of}} secretory and motor-evacuational {{functions of the}} stomach in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and gastrointestinal form of diabetic neuropathy. Materials and methods. 32 patients with DM 1 without gastrointestinal pathology allocated to different groups depending on DM duration (gr. 1 less than 10 yr, gr. 2 over 10 yr). Vegetative equilibrium was estimated from the Kerdo index, rehabilitative potential from its basic constituent (morphophysiological index). The motor-evacuational function of the stomach was studied {{with the use of}} a scintillation gamma-chamber, the gastric secretory function by pH measurements. Results. Half of the patients in gr 2 presented with hypersympathicotony. The frequency of hypertonic form of gastric tone increased with duration of DM while the acid-producing and evacuational functions of the stomach decreased (as estimated by pH-measurement and gastroscintiography respectively). The propulsive function most significantly decreased in the pyloric part. The efficacy of rehabilitation of diabetic patients with gastrointestinal form of diabetic neuropathy was much lower than in those with preserved vegetative function of the stomach. Conclusion. Impairment of evacuational function of the stomach and duodenum with DM 1 duration may be a cause of <b>unstable</b> <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> level. Hypomotor dyskinesia of the upper gastrointestinal tract due to DM 1 and deficit of parasympathetic innervation occurs more frequently in patients with low rehabilitative potential. Functional changes in the gastrointestinal tract of DM 1 patients do not depend on the quality of compensation of metabolic disorders but correlate (r=- 0. 39) with DM duration.

40|$|Object: Type 1 {{diabetes}} (T 1 D) {{is associated}} with other autoimmune diseases such as celiac disease (CD) and thyroid disease. It {{has been estimated that}} 4 - 12 % of children with T 1 D, also have CD. In Norway, most diabetic children are screened for CD. The aim was to investigate the relationship between T 1 D and CD in Norwegian children. Methods: We wanted to explore the extent of symptoms, treatment and quality of life. To answer these questions, a questionnaire was made based on two previous studies. The patients were 0 - 20 years old, and had both T 1 D and CD. Of 146 Norwegian patients who filled these criteria, 82 participated in the survey. Their mean age was 13 years, 62 % were girls. Results: The prevalence of CD in children with T 1 D is 8 % in Norway. 23 % had first-degree relatives with T 1 D or CD. The most common symptoms were gas, abdominal pain, weakness, <b>unstable</b> <b>blood</b> <b>glucose,</b> moodswings and poor growth. 90 % ate strictly gluten free diet (GFD). 64 % experienced improved health after initiating GFD. 7 % found it hard to follow the diet. Half of the patients felt always/frequently/sometimes excluded by their peers, two third felt different, embarrassed, angry. The quality of life was generally good and was not significantly different from patients with T 1 D only. Frequency of severe hypoglycemia, DKA and mean HbA 1 c was not significantly different between patients with or without CD. Conclusions: CD is an additional burden, but did not significantly impair quality of life or HbA 1 c compared to patients with T 1 D only...|$|E
40|$|Background. It {{has been}} {{previously}} demonstrated that addition of anti-LFA- 1 {{to a combination of}} CTLA 4 Ig and anti-CD 40 L induces the permanent acceptance of dopaminergic fetal pig xenografts when transplanted into the brain of wild-type mice. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test whether this costimulation blockade also can induce acceptance of adult pig islets transplanted to C 5713 L/ 6 mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Methods. Recipients were treated with CTLA 4 Ig/anti-CD 40 L +/- anti-LFA- 1 or isotype control antibodies during the first week after transplantation. Half of the costimulation blockade-treated recipients had their grafts removed after 8 weeks. The other half was observed up to 5 months. Results. Recipients treated with CTLA 4 Ig/anti-CD 40 L/anti-LFA- 1 had significantly lower blood glucose and gained more weight than CTLA 4 Ig/anti-CD 40 L-treated recipients. CTLA 4 Ig/anti-CD 40 L-treated recipients exhibited <b>unstable</b> <b>blood</b> <b>glucose.</b> IPGTT of these recipients revealed a slow recovery to normal blood glucose levels at week 4. In comparison, CTLA 4 Ig/anti-CD 40 L/anti-LFA- 1 treated recipients exhibited a significantly superior glucose clearance. CTLA 4 Ig/anti-CD 40 L +/- anti-LFA- 1 treated recipients did not produce anti-pig IgG, whereas control antibody-treated mice did. CD 4 + T cells from costimulation blockade-treated recipients proliferated less than CD 4 + T cells from control antibody-treated mice when co-cultured with syngeneic antigen presenting cells loaded with pig islet antigens. Conclusions. CTLA 4 Ig/anti-CD 40 L/anti-LFA- 1 -treated recipients had superior islet function compared with CTLA 4 Ig/anti-CD 40 L-treated recipients. However, both costimulation blockade regimens led to islet graft acceptance up to 5 months after a 1 -week treatment...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} effect of {{intensive}} insulin therapy on <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> amplitude variation and pattern irregularity in critically ill patients. To assess the association of these <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> signal characteristics with hospital mortality, independent of <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> level. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of the databases of two previously published randomized controlled trials. SETTING: University hospital, 56 -bed adult surgical intensive care unit and 17 -bed medical intensive care unit. PATIENTS: One thousand five-hundred forty-eight surgical intensive care unit patients, admitted between February 2000 and January 2001, and 1200 medical intensive care unit patients, admitted between March 2002 and May 2005. INTERVENTIONS: In the two randomized controlled trials, patients were randomized to receive either intensive insulin therapy (targeting normoglycemia, between 4. 4 and 6. 1 mmol/L) or conventional insulin therapy (infusing insulin when <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> levels were > 12 mmol/L and stopping at 10 mmol/L). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Intensive insulin therapy significantly lowered mean <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> (5. 8 vs. 8. 4 mmol/L), hyperglycemic index (0. 8 vs. 3. 2 mmol/L), and glycemic penalty index (26 vs. 53), but it increased the mean daily difference between minimum and maximum <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> (mean daily delta blood glucose; 4. 0 vs. 3. 3 mmol/L). There was no {{significant effect on the}} standard deviation of the <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> measurements or on jack-knifed approximate entropy. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, corrected for baseline risk factors, <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> levels outside the normoglycemic range, higher mean daily delta <b>blood</b> <b>glucose,</b> higher standard deviation <b>blood</b> <b>glucose,</b> and higher jack-knifed approximate entropy were independently associated with hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The Leuven intensive insulin therapy strategy increased mean daily delta <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> while not affecting standard deviation <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> and jack-knifed approximate entropy. Increased <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> amplitude variation and pattern irregularity were associated with mortality, irrespective of <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> level. The reduced mortality observed with intensive insulin therapy in the Leuven trials cannot be attributed to an effect on <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> amplitude variation or entropy.

METHODS: Rats were randomly divided into four groups: normal control group(NC), normal fluctuation group(NF), diabetes mellitus group(DM) and diabetes fluctuation group(DF). Diabetic models were induced through intraperitoneal injection of STZ. A certain amount of glucose was injected in the rats of group NF and DF intraperitoneally {{three times a day}} after the model was established, thereby causing <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> fluctuations. Full-day <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> monitoring was conducted once every two weeks to observe the <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> fluctuation situation, according to <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> levels drawing the “time-blood glucose concentration” curve. The stability of <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> was evaluated from four different aspects, through calculating mean blood glucose(MBG), standard deviation blood glucose(SDBG), largest amplitude of glycemic excursions(LAGE) and Sclichtkrull Mz value. RESULTS: The full-day <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> of rats in the group NC was in a normal range, and it was stable without fluctuation. The <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> of rats in group NF was fluctuated between 5 - 10 mmol/L. The <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> of rats in group DM were maintained at higher level(> 20 mmol/L), without great fluctuation extent and DF with sighificant fluctuation. The <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> fluctuation in graoup DF was significant. The <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> changes of rats in the group NF and DF were significant and regular. The curve of <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> fluctuations was relatively stable. All values of rats in group NF, DM and DF were significantly increased compared with group NC. Group DF was increased more significantly, and the comparison with group NF and DM had significant difference(P CONCLUSION: Significant <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> fluctuation can be formed through the method of manual intraperitoneal injection of glucose.

40|$|Abstract Background For {{mothers with}} diabetes, {{breastfeeding}} {{is a great}} challenge due to their struggle with potentially <b>unstable</b> <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> levels. This paper explores breastfeeding attitudes and impact of breastfeeding on the daily life of mothers with type 1 diabetes compared with non-diabetic mothers. Methods We performed a prospective cohort study of 108 mothers with type 1 diabetes and a reference group of 104 mothers in the west of Sweden. Data were collected through medical records and structured telephone interviews at 2 and 6 months after childbirth. Results Women in both the diabetes group and the reference group had high levels of confidence (84 % and 93 % respectively) in their breastfeeding capacity before childbirth, and 90 % assessed breastfeeding as a positive and an important experience during the six months of follow-up. About 80 % assessed breastfeeding as influencing daily life ‘very much’ or ‘quite a lot’ at 2 months as did 60 % at 6 months, with {{no difference between the}} groups. In mothers with diabetes, the impact of breastfeeding on the priority of other duties decreased over time, as did feelings of time pressure and negative effects on patterns of sleep. Compared to the reference group, mothers with diabetes at 6 months remained more affected by disruptions in daily life and they felt more worried about their health both at 2 and 6 months after childbirth. For the reference group mothers’ sensitivity to unexpected disruptions in daily routines decreased between 2 and 6 months after childbirth, and they expressed a greater need to organize their time than mothers with diabetes. Conclusion Mothers with diabetes type 1 express more worry for own health and are more sensitive to distruptions.

40|$|Diabetes, {{specifically}} {{type 2 diabetes}} (T 2 DM), is a {{metabolic disease}} that is highly correlated with increasing age. Diabetes is prevalent in {{about a quarter of}} residents in LTC, where its management in elderly residents is complicated by the presence of multiple comorbidities, a high level of vulnerability and risk of death. Despite this, evidence for the benefit of tight blood glucose control in preventing cardiovascular and other geriatric outcomes in the frail elderly is inconclusive. Although many clinical practice guidelines (CPG) call for more relaxed blood glucose control in the frail elderly, evidence for relaxed blood glucose targets is mostly based on expert consensus, resulting in variable recommendations among different CPG’s. Furthermore, the current literature suggests that blood glucose values are generally below the recommended lower threshold (an A 1 C < 7. 0 %) in LTC residents. However, it is not conclusive as to whether lower A 1 C values are a reflection of the clinical characteristics of the frail elderly in LTC, or a result of stringent blood glucose control. Finally, research in Canada regarding the management of diabetes in LTC homes is greatly lacking. This study conducted a mixed method design (convergent parallel design) in order to explore the current practices, processes, and opinions of blood glucose control in Ontario LTC homes. This study conducted a provincial survey exploring opinions of blood glucose control and treatment among LTC medical directors and attending physicians across Ontario. Alongside the survey, this study also conducted in-depth phone interviews with medical directors, attending physicians, and nurses of varying educational and managerial positions, in order to explore the experiences of managing blood glucose in LTC residents with diabetes. The findings of this study illustrate the growing appreciation of less stringent blood glucose control in elderly LTC residents among LTC physicians and nurses. Frailty, a limited life expectancy and dementia, are common factors that promote less stringent blood glucose control. However, there is still variance in what blood glucose targets physicians are willing to consider. Furthermore, there appears to be two approaches to managing hyperglycemia in LTC. Whereas some physicians are mainly concerned with preventing acute symptoms of hyperglycemia in LTC residents with a less stringent approach, other physicians are of the opinion that hyperglycemia is still related to multiple short term illnesses and complications in LTC residents, and are less willing to consider the more extreme opinions of less stringent control that exist. Barriers to optimal blood glucose control within LTC homes include the presence of dementia and managing a resident’s diet, including unpredictable intake and poor diet choices by the resident or family. Physicians limited their consideration of sliding scale and complex insulin regimens in LTC residents when possible. However, attempts to reduce monitoring parameters was complicated by the presence of <b>unstable</b> <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> levels as a result of frailty, dementia, and variable diet intake. The study also identified the role for increased communication between health professionals within LTC and a need for continuing education, especially for the nursing staff, in order to facilitate optimal management. Future research should explore the perceptions and experiences of other key professionals and individuals that are essential to informing the experiences of blood glucose control and overall diabetes management in LTC. Studies should also address the current practices of diabetes management in LTC residents, in order to highlight any potential differences between what physicians and nurses report versus actual practice. Finally, future studies should explore the effect of hyperglycemia on short term complications and geriatric outcomes, in order to better inform management that improves {{the quality of life of}} residents...|$|E

It is noteworthy that, in the research process were respected ethical principles laid down in Resolution 196 / 96. The data were analyzed by statistical treatment of descriptive and discussed in the light of the relevant literature. For the construction of the diagnoses and nursing interventions, were used, respectively, the Classifications North American Nursing Diagnosis Association International and Nursing Interventions Classification. Results: In the interpretation of the findings, it was found that the septic picture occurred not only in the elderly more long-lived, but in the elderly young, with greater incidence between males and those with low education and low socioeconomic level. The lowest period of hospitalization was associated with the highest rates of mortality, which indicates great risk of death in these patients, when the clinical picture evolves for sepsis to septic shock. The main problems adaptive found were related to the components oxygenation and disposal. We identified 28 nursing diagnoses in group researched and obtained an average of 19. 6 diagnoses per elderly person. Among the most frequent, stood out 22 diagnoses that have reached a frequency greater than or equal to 50 %. The most incidents were: spontaneous ventilation impaired, impaired gas exchange, imbalanced nutrition: less than the body needs, self-care deficit: bath, intimate hygiene and feeding and the risk of <b>unstable</b> <b>blood</b> <b>glucose.</b> Thus, for these nursing diagnoses, were drawn up results and nursing interventions that could subsidize the decision-making process of the nurse, which contributes to solve or minimize such diagnoses. Conclusion: The data obtained by means of this research suggest that nursing care is essential and a priority for the elderly in septic process, especially when based on Adaptation Model of Roy. Considering this, it was drawn up a plan of care with a view to promoting a care directed at the needs of elderly septic that may help to reduce/minimize the situations of physiological adaptation ineffective...|$|E

Although fingertip capillary blood has been used for SMBG, alternative-site <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> testing (i. e., from the forearm or the palm of the hand) has been developed because patients have requested less painful measurement tech-niques. However, there has been debate about <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> equivalence at alter-native sites because some reports suggest that glucose monitoring at the forearm shows a delayed value if <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> changes rapidly (1, 2). One study reported that <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> measurement at the palm is not delayed compared with fin-gertip measurement after a test meal and exercise load (3). Another study reported that palm <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> is comparable to fingertip <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> in acute hypogly-cemia (4). Since there has been no re-search comparing <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> values simultaneously at the fingertip, forearm, and palm of the hand in acute hypoglyce-mia, we performed this study to compare <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> values in induced acute hy-poglycemia at several sites and evaluated the differences in alternative-site <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> testing...|$|R

Methods The study included a total of 120 clinically healthy client-owned cats aged 8 years and older of varying breeds and BCSs. <b>Blood</b> <b>glucose</b> was measured {{at the beginning of the}} consultation from an ear/paw sample using a portable glucose meter calibrated for cats, and again after physical examination from a jugular sample. Fasting <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> was measured after overnight hospitalisation and fasting for 18 - 24 h. Results The reference interval upper limit for screening <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> was 189 mg/dl (10. 5 mmol/l). Mean screening <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> was greater than mean fasting glucose. Breed, body weight, BCS, behaviour score, fasting <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> concentration and amount of carbohydrate consumed 2 - 24 h before sampling collectively explained only a small proportion of the variability in screening <b>blood</b> <b>glucose.</b> Conclusions and relevance Screening <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> measurement represents a simple test, and cats with values from 117 - 189 mg/dl (6. 5 - 10. 5 mmol/l) should be retested several hours later. Cats with initial screening <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> > 189 mg/dl (10. 5 mmol/l), or a second screening <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> > 116 mg/dl (6. 4 mmol/l) several hours after the first, should have fasting glucose and glucose tolerance measured after overnight hospitalisation...|$|R

We wished to develop an insulin adjustment protocol for an adult intensive care unit to maintain <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> concentrations safely within a narrow range. Methods: After a 6 month introductory period, an observational study was conducted during a 10 month period in an Australian level III intensive care unit to assess the safety and feasibility of an insulin adjustment protocol to maintain <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> concentrations safely within a narrow range. The protocol included a variable insulin infusion, a constant caloric source and frequent <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> level monitoring to detect and prevent hypoglycaemia. Results: Over the 10 month period a total of 148 patients were studied using the protocol and represented 13 % of all intensive care unit admissions during this period. In total, there were 12, 623 patient hours ‘on protocol’, with 5, 603 <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> levels performed. The mean morning <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> level was 6. 5 mmol/L and 49 % of <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> levels were within the target range of 4. 1 - 7. 0 mmol/L. There were four recorded incidents of hypoglycaemia, defined as a <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> level of less than 2. 2 mmol/L, the lowest at 1. 5 mmol/L being the only symptomatic episode. The incidence of hyperglycaemia (<b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> level> 10 mmol/L) was 13 % of all <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> level measurements.
