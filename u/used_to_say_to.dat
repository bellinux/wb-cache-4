500|$|In 1965, at age 90 {{and with}} no heirs, Calment signed a deal to sell her {{apartment}} to lawyer André-François Raffray, retaining a life estate. Raffray, then aged 47 years, agreed to pay her a monthly sum of 2,500 francs (€381.12) until she died. Raffray ended up paying Calment the equivalent of more than €140,000 which was {{more than double the}} apartment's value. After Raffray's death from cancer at the age of 77, in 1995, his family continued the payments until Calment's death. Calment's comment on this situation was reported to be, [...] "In life, one sometimes makes bad deals." [...] During all these years, Calment <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> them that she [...] "competed with Methuselah". In 1985, she moved into a nursing home, having lived on her own until age 110.|$|E
500|$|In {{making the}} album Parablepsia, Kawada {{describes}} {{the concept of}} the album as [...] "E.M.R.", which stands for [...] "Electric. Mami Kawada. Rock". She considers [...] "Borderland" [...] to be most representative of her style, so she wanted to make an album which included songs which sounded similar to it. Originally, she only wanted a single song to convey the theme of the album, but for Parablepsia, several songs do. This includes the title song [...] "Parablepsia", which she describes as a song about not losing yourself in a society which moves around in circles, [...] "Fly Blind", which is a song about not always allowing yourself to be influenced by society, [...] "Eager Eyes", which is the song in the album which has the closest style to [...] "Borderland", [...] "It's no big deal", which takes inspiration from a phrase that her father <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> her, and [...] "Dendritic Quartz", which is about flowers which constantly bloom and will never wither; [...] "Dendritic Quartz" [...] takes inspiration from a pendant she owns which has a pattern of trees.|$|E

500|$|Although Howarth was {{familiar}} with campus fraternity life while attending George Washington University, he did not base Todd or his other roles on anyone he knew. [...] When asked about his roles, {{he was unable to}} explain why he was consistently cast as a bad guy, but said that he enjoyed it. [...] "I would never want to come in now and play a nice guy for three months. That would be dreadfully boring. This suits me fine. It's just as easy to pretend I'm a bad guy as it is to pretend I'm a good guy," [...] Howarth said. Playing a rapist was like playing any other role because [...] " [...] it's all make-believe". He was perplexed by writers' need to redeem villains. [...] "Todd's a pretty interesting character just the way he is," [...] Howarth said in late 1994. [...] "There's no need to fix it if it's not broken. I don't know where the whole notion of redeeming characters comes from. People <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> me, 'I hope you get redeemed so you can stay on the show.' Well, Todd hasn't been redeemed, and he's still on the show." [...] He added, [...] "I don't love the character I play. If I met Todd on the street, I wouldn't say 'Hi' to him, but I do love playing this character." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tom Wills, Australia's most revered cricketer of {{the mid-19th}} century, was also its most {{controversial}} {{and he was}} often accused of (and admitted to) throwing. Many of his contemporaries recalled his trickery: [...] " [...] <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> the umpire, 'Just look at my feet, will you; I have a bad habit now and then of going over the crease.' The umpire would look at Tom's feet, and Tom would let go a throw for all he was worth." [...] In 1872 {{he became the first}} cricketer to be called for throwing in a major Australian match, effectively ending his first-class career.|$|E

So people <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> me, 'You're like a whoopee cushion.' And that's where the name came from." [...] She said in 2011, [...] "My mother did not name me Whoopi, but Goldberg is my name, it's part of my family, part of my heritage. Just like being black." [...] Henry Louis Gates, Jr., in his book In Search of Our Roots: How 19 Extraordinary African Americans Reclaimed Their Past, found that all of Goldberg's traceable ancestors were African Americans, that she has no known Jewish ancestry, and that none of her ancestors were named Goldberg. Results of a DNA test, revealed in the 2006 PBS documentary African American Lives, traced part of her ancestry to the Papel and Bayote people of modern-day Guinea-Bissau. Her admixture test indicates that she is of 92% sub-Saharan African origin and of 8% European origin.|$|E
2500|$|Clarke {{conducted}} at ten or more London theatres, including the Lyceum Theatre, where he composed music {{for a number}} of Henry Irving's productions, including Hamlet and The Merchant of Venice. Irving's co-star, Ellen Terry, wrote in her memoir, The Story of My Life, [...] "No one was cleverer than Hamilton Clarke, Henry's first musical director, and a most gifted composer, at carrying out [...] instructions. [...] Hamilton Clarke often grew angry and flung out of the theatre, saying that it was quite impossible to do what Mr. Irving wanted. 'Patch it together, indeed!' he <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> me indignantly.... 'Mr. Irving knows nothing about music, or he couldn't ask me to do such a thing.' But the next day he would return with the score altered on the lines suggested by Henry, and would confess that the music was improved. 'Upon my soul, it's better! The 'Guv'nor' was perfectly right.'" [...] He was one of the many composers recruited to write German Reed Entertainments at St. George's Hall. These included Castle Botherem: or An Irish Stew (1880), Cherry Tree Farm (1881), [...] and Nobody's Fault (1882) to texts by Arthur Law, and Fairly Puzzled (text by Oliver Brand) in 1884 and A Pretty Bequest (text by T. Malcolm Watson) in 1885. Reviews both for Clarke's music and the performances of Corney Grain {{and the rest of the}} company were excellent.|$|E
2500|$|Tabari relates on the {{authority}} of Ibn Ishaq that when Jesus was about nine or ten years old, his mother Mary would send him to a Jewish religious school. But whenever the teacher tried to teach him anything, he found that Jesus already knew it. The teacher exclaimed, [...] "Do you not marvel at the son of this widow? Every time I teach him anything, I find that he knows it far better than I do!" [...] Tabari further relates on {{the authority}} of Ismail al-Suddi that [...] "when Jesus was in his youth, his mother committed him [...] to study the Torah. While Jesus played with the youths of his village, he used {{to tell them what}} their parents were doing." [...] Sa'id ibn Jubayr, according to Tabari, is said to have reported that Jesus would say to one of his fellow playmates in the religious school, [...] "Your parents have kept such and such food for you, would you give me some of it?" [...] Jesus would usually tell his fellow pupils in the religious school what their parents ate and what they have kept for them when they return home.

2500|$|Phil has a {{panic button}} {{installed}} and Kathy helps the police trace Gavin via his mobile phone. Ben tells Gavin to leave or be arrested, {{as the police}} have arrived. Ben tells his family that Gavin has left, but Gavin returns, where Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) apparently recognises him and appears fearful. On Halloween, Kathy is on edge, and she fears Gavin has gone into Ian's house. Ben and Kathy then see Gavin, but are unsure it was him. They go to Phil's house, where Gavin locks Phil and Dennis Rickman Jnr (Bleu Landau) in a bedroom. When Kathy attempts to call the police, Gavin appears. He threatens to light fireworks inside the house, hoping to kill himself, Kathy, Ben, Phil and Dennis. Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean), Phil's wife and Dennis's mother, arrives and Gavin reveals he knows that Sharon is the adopted daughter of Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) and Angie Watts (Anita Dobson). Gavin surprises Kathy by saying that Walford was once his home {{and he had a}} child. Sharon realises Gavin could be her birth father, and he confirms it when he says, [...] "Hello, princess", which Den <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> her. Kathy pleads with Gavin not to light the fireworks and promises to leave with him again. Phil escapes, knocks Gavin unconscious and ties him up. While Sharon talks to Kathy, she realises that Margaret Midhurst (Jan Harvey), the solicitor who arranged her adoption and who she has been visiting to track her father, is Gavin's sister. When Gavin wakes up, Sharon asks about her adoption; Gavin says he had a fling with Carol Hanley (Sheila White), who had a breakdown after Sharon's birth, and Gavin was not paternal but Den was, so he traded Sharon for part in a bank raid that Den was working on. Phil then tells Sharon that Gavin previously had him locked in a room with no windows and just a bottle of whisky, meaning Phil turned to alcohol. Sharon decides to call the police so presses Phil's panic button. Sharon then confronts Gavin, who tells her that he asked Den to greet Sharon for him occasionally by calling her [...] "princess". When the police arrive, Gavin has gone. Sharon reveals she took money from Phil's safe to let Gavin go, and when she meets Margaret again, she confirms she helped Gavin fake his death and gives Sharon his phone number. Sharon calls and leaves a message, and later receives a text message, saying they will see each other soon.|$|E
