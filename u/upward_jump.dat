In essence, the athlete goes into a slight squat (crouch) upon landing in which the hip, knee, and ankle joints flex.

As the knee-joint extension is taking place, ankle-joint extension begins {{and is the only}} action that occurs as the takeoff (breaking contact with the ground) takes place.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a new and}} accessible approach to establishing certain results concerning the discounted penalty function. The direct approach consists of two steps. In the first step, closed-form expressions are obtained in the special {{case in which the}} claim amount distribution is a combination of exponential distributions. A rational function is useful in this context. For the second step, one observes that the family of combinations of exponential distributions is dense. Hence, it suffices to reformulate the results of the first step to obtain general results. The surplus process has downward and <b>upward</b> <b>jumps,</b> modeled by two independent compound Poisson processes. If the distribution of the <b>upward</b> <b>jumps</b> is exponential, a series of new results can be obtained with ease. Subsequently, certain results of Gerber and Shiu [H. U. Gerber and E. S. W. Shiu, North American Actuarial Journal 2 (1) : 48 – 78 (1998) ] can be reproduced. The two-step approach is also applied when an independent Wiener process is added to the surplus process.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} the effect that 2 lb and 5 lb hand-held weights had on vertical jump performance as assessed by vertical takeoff velocity. Secondary analyses were conducted to provide additional insight into the observed results. Thirty-one male athletes performed three countermovement jumps (CMJ) with an arm-swing under three different treatment conditions: holding a 2 lb hand weight in each hand (CMJ 2), holding a 5 lb weight in each hand (CMJ 5), and without holding onto any weight (CMJ 0). All jumps were performed on a forceplate, which permitted the calculation of vertical take-off velocity (vto), average force during the <b>upward</b> <b>jump</b> phase (avgforceup) and the duration of the <b>upward</b> <b>jump</b> phase (timeup). A repeated measures ANOVA was used to test for significant differences between the three treatment conditions for both the primary and secondary analyses.

40|$|Substantial {{evidence}} from animal studies indicates that jumping increases bone mass and strength. However, most {{studies have focused}} on the take-off, rather than the landing phase of jumps. Thus, we compared the effects of landing and <b>upward</b> <b>jump</b> impact on trabecular bone mass and microarchitecture. Male Wistar rats aged 10 weeks were randomly assigned to the following groups: sedentary control (CON), 40 -cm upward jumps (40 UJ); 40 -cm drop jumps (40 DJ); and 60 -cm drop jumps (60 DJ) (n = 10 each). The <b>upward</b> <b>jump</b> protocol comprised 10 upward jumps/day, 5 days/week for 8 weeks to a height of 40 cm. The drop jump protocol comprised dropping rats from a height of 40 or 60 cm at the same frequency and time period as the 40 UJ group. Trabecular bone mass, architecture, and mineralization at the distal femoral metaphysis were evaluated using microcomputed tomography. Ground reaction force (GRF) was measured using a force platform. Bone mass was significantly higher in the 40 UJ group compared with the DJ groups (+ 49. 1 % and + 28. 3 %, respectively), although peak GRF (- 57. 8 % and - 122. 7 %, respectively) and unit time force (- 21. 6 % and - 36. 2 %, respectively) were significantly lower in the 40 UJ group. These results showed that trabecular bone mass in growing rats is increased more effectively by the take-off than by the landing phases of jumps and suggest that mechanical stress accompanied by muscle contraction would be more important than GRF as an osteogenic stimulus. However, the relevance of these findings to human bone physiology is unclear and requires further study...|$|E

The leading order curvature correction to θ is proportional to g^ 2 / 3. The expansion applies in particular to exponential decay in the limit of large level, where the curvature correction considerably improves the linear approximation.
