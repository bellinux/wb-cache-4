5000|$|The most {{traditional}} method, {{also known as}} the angel food cake method is as follows. First the egg whites, and possibly salt and cream of tartar, are mixed at a medium speed <b>until</b> a <b>soft</b> <b>peak</b> forms. Whipping continues while the sugar is slowly added. Once a hard peak is formed, [...] the flour is folded into the mixture of egg whites and sugar. This technique is done in order to disturb the foam as little as possible.|$|R
40|$|Egg white foam {{is a type}} of foam (a colloid {{in which}} a gas is {{dispersed}} or spread throughout a liquid) used in meringues, souffl és, and angel food cake to make them light and porous (airy). To prepare an egg white foam, egg whites are initially beaten (with a wire wisk or electric mixer) until they become frothy. Then an acid (such as cream of tartar) is added. Depending on the application, the beating of the egg white continues <b>until</b> <b>soft</b> (when the <b>peaks</b> stand straight and bend slightly at the tips) or stiff peaks (when the peaks stand straight without bending) are formed. Salt and sugar may also be added. How It Works: Egg whites are made up of water, protein, and small amounts of minerals and sugars. When the egg whites are beaten, air is added and the egg white protein, albumen, is denatured. Denaturation is the change of a protein’s shape under stress (in this case, beating). The denatured protein coats the air bubbles and holds in the water, causing them t...|$|R

40|$|We {{compute the}} {{composite}} X-ray spectrum {{of a population}} of unresolved SSS's in a spiral galaxy such as our own or M 31. The sources are meant to represent the total underlying population corresponding to all sources which have bolometric luminosities {{in the range of}} 10 (exp 37) - 10 (exp 38) ergs/s and kT on the order of tens of eV. These include close-binary supersoft sources, symbiotic novae, and planetary nebulae, for example. In order to determine whether the associated X-ray signal would be detectable, we also 'seed' the galaxy with other types of X-ray sources, specifically low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXB's) and high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXB's). We find that the total spectrum due to SSS's, LMXB's, and HMXB's exhibits a <b>soft</b> <b>peak</b> which owes its presence to the SSS population. Preliminary indications are that this <b>soft</b> <b>peak</b> may be observable...|$|R
