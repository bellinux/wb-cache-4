40|$|Spain is {{the largest}} European <b>Union</b> <b>producer</b> and {{exporter}} of pomegranates. More than 85 % of Spanish commercial plantings {{are located in the}} Elche area (Alicante Province, SE Spain), where cv. Mollar de Elche is the most important cultivar. The incidence and etiology of postharvest pomegranate diseases were determined in local environmental conditions. Commercially-grown pomegranates cv. Mollar de Elche from two orchards were assessed, during two consecutive seasons, for latent and wound pathogens causing postharvest diseases. Healthy pomegranates were either artificially wounded in the rind or surface disinfected and placed in humid chambers at 20 ºC for up to 15 weeks. Additionally, decay was periodically assessed on commercially-handled pomegranates stored at 5 ºC for up to 27 weeks. The main causal agents of wound and latent infections were Penicillium spp. and Botrytis cinerea, respectively. The same pathogens were also the most frequently isolated from cold-stored fruit, but decay at 5 ºC was only significant after 19 weeks. Another relatively frequent pathogen on fruit incubated at 20 ºC was Aspergillus niger. Among the fungi isolated, Penicillium expansum, P. sclerotiorum, P. glabrum and Pilidiella granati were pathogenic on inoculated pomegranates, whereas P. minioluteum and Cytospora annulata were not. No decay caused by Alternaria spp. or Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was observed. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper briefly narrates the {{historical}} and present challenges facing sheep herders in the Kyrgyz Republic. Originally these were nomads employing an horizontal and vertical migration system, but Russian conquest and settlement forced this to change {{to a system of}} transhumance. The latter, albeit structured in a collective system, was more or less maintained throughout the communist period. Other major changes during this period included the shift from fat tail meat sheep to fine wool sheep and the increasing dependence on imported feed. Independence since 1991 has caused drastic changes in resource ownership, organisation and feed supply. These changes have led to a fragmentation of sheep ownership and a 50 % decline in sheep numbers. Although land reform in the Kyrgyz Republic is ongoing, the situation regarding rangeland is still rather confused. Many of the high mountain pastures are State owned, but logistical problems, together with the contraction of the national flock, have caused them to become decreasingly well used. This has led to the over-utilisation of lowland pastures, which has been aggravated by shortages in feed supplements (imports of which were halted after the break-up of the Soviet <b>Union).</b> <b>Producer</b> prices are low, and can be linked to the remote location of producers, a lack of local purchasing power and the low quality of wool produced. It is not yet clear whether the sheep production system will continue to produce fine wool in the future, or whether it will revert to the meat/coarse wool production system seen commonly throughout the Near East...|$|E

The second part describes the role that trade unions could play both within individual producer co-operatives and in the wider movement.
