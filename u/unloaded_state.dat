50|$|Emerson {{manufactures}} a {{scroll compressor}} that {{is capable of}} varying the refrigerant flow as per requirement. Instead of fixing the scrolls together permanently, the scrolls are allowed to move apart periodically. As the scrolls move apart, the motor continues to turn but the scrolls lose the ability to compress refrigerant, thus motor power is reduced when the scroll compressor is not pumping. By alternating the two different working states: the loaded state and the <b>unloaded</b> <b>state.</b> A solenoid contracts and expands the rotating scroll and/or the fixed scroll, using axial compliance. The controller modifies the load time, and the unload time, matching the capacity of the compressor to the load requested. This type of scroll compressors while offering variable capacity control, normally down to 20% of the full flow, can suffer from a significant loss of efficiency especially toward the lower range of the capacity control.|$|E
50|$|When {{a surface}} area is {{illuminated}} {{with a highly}} coherent laser light, a stochastical interference pattern is created. This interference pattern is called a speckle, and is projected on a rigid camera's CCD chip. Analogous with Electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI), to obtain results from the speckle we need to compare it with a known reference light. Shearography uses the test object itself as the known reference; it shears the image so a double image is created. The superposition of the two images, a shear image, represents {{the surface of the}} test object at this <b>unloaded</b> <b>state.</b> This makes the method much less sensitive to external vibrations and noise. By applying a small load, the material will deform. A nonuniform material quality will generate a nonuniform movement of the surface of the test object. A new shearing image is recorded at the loaded state and is compared with the sheared image before load. If a flaw is present, it will be seen.|$|E

50|$|Providing {{further insight}} is the {{observation}} that the <b>unloading</b> <b>state</b> of spaceflight and of HS also increases the expression of fast type II sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) ATPase-driven calcium pumps (SERCA II) while repressing the slower type I SERCA calcium pump. Since calcium cycling is used to regulate fiber activation and relaxation, the SR component of the muscle fiber controls the synchrony of contraction-relaxation processes. Since calcium cycling and crossbridge cycling are the two major systems that account {{for the vast majority}} of the energy expended during muscle contraction to support movement, when this property of the muscle is switched to a faster system the muscle can function more effectively in the unloaded environment. However, when the muscle encounters environments with a high gravitational stimulus, the faster properties are inherently less economical in opposing gravity and thus the muscle fibers become more fatigable when contracting against a load for long durations.|$|R

30|$|We have {{demonstrated}} air-bubble-entrapped conductors with both enhanced elastic properties and electrical robustness for stretchable electronics applications. The functional air bubbles can be formed easily {{and sustained in}} a CNT-doped PDMS matrix {{with the aid of}} a small amount of surfactant. It was experimentally found that the bubble conductor requires ~ 3.4 times lower stress (~ 66  kPa) compared to the bare conductor (~ 225  kPa) to achieve ~ 80  % elongation. The change in the electrical resistance of the stretchable conductor upon stretching to 80  % was decreased by ~ 44.8  % (from 39.5 to 21.8  %) by integrating air bubbles into the matrix. The bubble conductor also showed quite reliable and reversible performance under repetitive operations, with low standard deviations of 0.58 and 0.36  % in the loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>states,</b> respectively. The bubble conductors could find many potential applications in stretchable electronics due to the advantages that include simple fabrication, enhanced elastic properties, and electrical robustness against physical deformations.|$|R
30|$|The {{presence}} of cracks is unavoidable in reinforced concrete structures {{and also a}} gateway for chloride into concrete, leading to corrosion of steel reinforcing bars. So, crack control, crack width limitation and chloride threshold levels are well-established concepts in durability of reinforced concrete structures. This paper reports on accelerated chloride-induced corrosion in cracked reinforced strain-hardening cement-based composites and reinforced mortar beams, both in loaded and <b>unloaded</b> <b>states.</b> Corrosion rates are monitored and loss of mass and yield force, as well as corrosion pitting depth in steel bars are reported. The chloride content at different depths in specimens is also determined through XRF, and through chemical testing of acid and water soluble chloride content by titration. Finally, different relationships are drawn between crack properties, mass loss, yield force, corroded depth and chloride levels at the steel surface for different cover depths. It is found that the crack spacing and free chloride at the steel surface level are best correlated to the corrosion damage in the specimens.|$|R

Measurements were performed with and without superimposed tensile mechanical loading and the results compared with analytical results. The improved spatial resolution of the synchrotron technique relative to the other methods has allowed the strain fields around a fatigue crack growing from a cold-expanded hole to be evaluated in the <b>unloaded</b> <b>state</b> and at two loading levels.

30|$|The {{importance}} of strain energy density {{and in particular}} the distortional part of it relative to material failure was understood, conjectured and postulated, as early as in the era of Maxwell (1937) and others (Hencky 1924; Huber 1904). Strain energy, supplied to the material via some generalized loading, can be additively decomposed into two parts: the elastic and the inelastic one (for metals the plastic one); the elastic strain energy is recoverable upon removing the load (i.e., the corresponding strain at the <b>unloaded</b> <b>state</b> is zero) {{due to the fact that}} the materials remained elastic throughout its loading; the plastic strain energy is unrecoverable (and sometimes is called plastic work because it represents the energy lost to microstructural dissipative processes such as grain boundary slippage) that, when the load is removed, yields a permanent strain known as plastic strain.|$|E
30|$|As an {{assumption}} to this work, we considered only symmetrical loading cases. Two reasons {{did not allow}} to consider asymmetrical loading: first, the geometric imperfection at the <b>unloaded</b> <b>state</b> and second, the high deformability of the mock-up. The deviation of the initial geometry from the theoretical model influenced the structural behavior, producing asymmetrical displacement fields and asymmetrical modal shapes although the symmetrical loading. Hence, asymmetrical loading would have complicated the structural identification of the mock-up. Moreover, since the lowest collapse multiplier is usually associated with asymmetrically loaded grid shells, the Voronoi vault would have prematurely drawn its ultimate limit state for the same (or even lower) loading rates, being the vault not optimized for asymmetric loading conditions. A complete validation for the Voronoi tessellation {{in the presence of}} asymmetric loading is demanded to future works, as well as investigations on the effect of additional stiffening contribution given by bracing cables.|$|E
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{modelling}} of nonlinear response of reinforced concrete structures {{by means of the}} finite element method. A new technique which employs a variable mesh {{in order to reduce the}} computational cost of classical approaches is presented. For some piecewise linear constitutive models which are widely employed for the modelling of reinforced concrete, some properties of the solution can be predicted. The knowledge of these properties can be used as a discretization criterion of the structural elements. Therefore, the nonlinearity of the problem is easily handled with an iterative scheme that modifies adaptively the position of the nodes. The results obtained on some framed structures show that with this scheme we obtain accurate solutions with a substancial reduction of the computational cost compared with the solutions obtained with fixed meshes, both for loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>states.</b> 1 A.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} {{was to examine the}} effects of {{artificial}} gravity (2. 5 g) on skeletal muscle strength and key anabolic/catabolic markers known to regulate muscle mass. Two groups of subjects were selected for study: 1) a 21 day-bed rest (BR) control (C) group (N= 7); and 2) an AG group (N= 8), which was exposed to 21 days of bed-rest plus daily 1 hr exposures to AG (2. 5 g). This particular experiment was part of an integrated AG Pilot Project sponsored by NASA/Johnson Space Center. The in vivo torque-velocity relationships of the knee extensors and plantar flexors of the ankle were determined pre and post treatment. Also, pre- and post treatment biopsy samples were obtained from both the vastus lateralis and soleus muscles and were used, in part, for a series of analyses on gene expression (mRNA abundance) of key factors implicated in the anabolic versus catabolic state of the muscle. Post/Pre toque-velocity determinations revealed greater decrements in knee extensor performance in the C versus AG group (P less than 0. 04). The plantar flexor muscle group of the AG subjects actually demonstrated a net gain in torque-velocity relationship; whereas, in the C group the overall post/pre responses declined (AG vs C; P less than 0. 001). Measurements of muscle fiber cross-sectional area (for both muscles) demonstrated a loss of approx. 20 % in the C group while no losses were evident in the AG group. RT-PCR analyses of muscle biopsy specimens demonstrated that markers of growth and cytoskeletal integrity (IGF- 1, IGF- 1 BP 4, mechano growth factor, total RNA, and pro-collagen 3 a) were higher in the AG group, whereas catabolic markers (myostatin and atrogen) were elevated in the C group. Importantly, these patterns were seen in both muscles. Based on these observations we conclude that paradigms of AG have the potential to maintain the functional, biochemical, and structural homeostasis of skeletal muscle in the face of chronic <b>unloading</b> <b>states.</b> These findings also warrant further studies since it is likely that other robust paradigms of AG that employ various exercise strategies may be more effective in counteracting long duration <b>unloading</b> <b>states</b> as anticipated on the platforms of the Moon and Mars...|$|R
