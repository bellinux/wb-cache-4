50|$|Niépce used Bitumen of Judea as the photoresist. Initially soluble {{in various}} spirits and oils, a thin coating of bitumen hardens (polymerizes) {{where it is}} exposed to light. The <b>unexposed</b> <b>parts</b> can then be rinsed away with a solvent, baring the {{underlying}} material, which can then be etched to the desired depth. Niépce's process lay dormant for many years, but it was revived in the 1850s and bitumen was widely used as a photoresist far into the 20th century. Very long exposures in bright light were required, but bitumen had the advantage that it was superbly resistant to strong acids.|$|E
50|$|The root words photo, litho, and graphy {{all have}} Greek origins, with the {{meanings}} 'light', 'stone' and 'writing' respectively. As {{suggested by the}} name compounded from them, photolithography is a printing method (originally based {{on the use of}} limestone printing plates) in which light plays an essential role. In the 1820s, Nicephore Niepce invented a photographic process that used Bitumen of Judea, a natural asphalt, as the first photoresist. A thin coating of the bitumen on a sheet of metal, glass or stone became less soluble where it was exposed to light; the <b>unexposed</b> <b>parts</b> could then be rinsed away with a suitable solvent, baring the material beneath, which was then chemically etched in an acid bath to produce a printing plate. The light-sensitivity of bitumen was very poor and very long exposures were required, but despite the later introduction of more sensitive alternatives, its low cost and superb resistance to strong acids prolonged its commercial life into the early 20th century. In 1940, Oskar Süß created a positive photoresist by using diazonaphthoquinone, which worked in the opposite manner: the coating was initially insoluble and was rendered soluble where it was exposed to light. In 1954, Louis Plambeck Jr. developed the Dycryl polymeric letterpress plate, which made the platemaking process faster.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was carried out}} {{about the effect of}} warm moisture on the fracture energy of an adhesive system formed by steel adherends joined by an epoxy adhesive. The specimens were double cantilever beams, manufactured with the open-face technique. The halves of the specimens (single beams covered by the ‘‘primary'' adhesive layer) were degraded in a climatic cell at 50 °C and 100 % RH, for time periods in the range of 1 - 5 weeks. At the end of each desired period, the half-specimens were dried, to account for irreversible effects only, and the bonds were completed with the second halves. Static fracture tests were carried out on an Instron 100 kN machine, monitoring crack propagation with a charge-coupled device microscope. The data were processed by means of the Simple Beam Theory to calculate the strain energy release rate and the R-curves were obtained. Similar trends were found for initial and steady critical strain energy release rates: compared to <b>unexposed</b> specimens, great <b>part</b> of the reduction (about - 50 %, - 40 %, respectively) occurred in the first week, stabilized values (about - 80 %, - 60 %) were observed after 3 weeks. The load-displacement curves decreased likewise. The fracture, mostly interfacial, followed a stepped crack path between the adherend...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} method of {{fabricating}} aperture tapered-fiber metal-coated SNOM probes with a corrugated core surface which assures efficient photon-to-plasmon conversion and thus high energy throughput. High energy throughput allows for a small apex aperture and high resolution. The procedure consists of recording of Bragg grating in the to-be-tapered part of a Ge-doped silica fiber and chemical etching with the Turner method. Bragg gratings are recorded with UV light through nearly sinusoidal phase masks of chosen lattice constants. The refractive index contrast in the Bragg grating differentiates the etch rate of the Ge-doped hydrogenated fiber core in exposed and <b>unexposed</b> <b>parts</b> by about 100 nm/min at room temperature...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePhoto-thermo-refractive (PTR) {{glass is}} an {{optically}} transparent photosensitive oxide glass. Upon heating, the UV-exposed regions of this glass undergo copious crystallization of NaF nano-crystals {{giving rise to}} a permanent, localized refractive index change.

A self-consistent description of these data is presented in the framework of classical nucleation theory using the interfacial free energy of the critical nuclei and the effective diffusion coefficient as adjustable parameters.

40|$|The Hyde-Macraes hear zone in east Otago, New Zealand, is a low-angle north- to northeast-dipping thrust {{system in}} which gold-bearing quartz veins have been deposited. Mineralization {{accompanied}} deformation in the shear zone which is preferentially developed in graphitic pelitic schist. The shear zone is a duplex system dominated by steep hinterland-dipping thrust faults between well-defined shallow-dipping upper and lower bounding thrusts. Imbrication and stacking {{have occurred in the}} shear zone, especially where intrashear schist is psammitic and relatively brittle. This stacking contributes to lateral thickness changes from 2 up to 125 m. Mineralized veins formed mainly in dilational jogs or localized extensional zones on the relatively shallow-dipping parts of the intrashear thrust faults. Late-stage shallow south-dipping extensional veins crosscut the duplex structures but are related to the same overall deformation. From analysis of the shear zone structure, it is possible to make predictions about the geometry of mineralized schist within <b>unexposed</b> <b>parts</b> of the shear zone.

40|$|Styrene is {{a widely}} used {{chemical}} {{in the manufacture of}} synthetic rubber, resins, polyesters, and plastics. The highest levels of human exposure to styrene occur during the production of reinforced plastic products. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine occupational exposure to styrene in a multistage approach, in order to integrate the following endpoints: styrene in workplace air, mandelic and phenylglyoxylic acids (MA + PGA) in urine, sister chromatid exchanges (SCE), micronuclei (MN), DNA damage (comet assay), and genetic polymorphisms of metabolizing enzymes (CYP 2 E 1, EPHX 1, GSTM 1, GSTT 1, and GSTP 1). Seventy-five workers from a fiberglass-reinforced plastics factory and 77 <b>unexposed</b> controls took <b>part</b> in the study. The mean air concentration of styrene in the breathing zone of workers (30. 4 ppm) and the mean concentration of urinary metabolites (MA + PGA = 443 ± 44 mg/g creatinine) exceeded the threshold limit value (TLV) and the biological exposure index (BEI). Significantly higher SCE frequency rate and DNA damage were observed in exposed workers, but MN frequency was not markedly modified by exposure. With respect to the effect of genetic polymorphisms on different exposure and effect biomarkers studied, an increase in SCE levels with elevated microsomal epoxide hydrolase activity was noted in exposed workers, suggesting a possible exposure-genotype interaction...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the association between chronic arsenic exposure through drinking groundwater and decrement in lung function, particularly among individuals who do not have signs of arsenic lesions, among an adult population. This was a comparative cross-sectional study conducted during the months of January to March 2009. One hundred participants a parts per thousand yen 15 years of age in each group, i. e. exposed (a parts per thousand yen 100 mu g/l) and <b>unexposed</b> (a <b>parts</b> per thousand currency sign 10 mu g/l) to arsenic, determined by testing drinking water samples (using portable kits), were compared for effects on lung function using spirometry. A structured and validated questionnaire was administered. Examination for arsenic skin lesions was also done. There was a decline in the mean adjusted FEV 1 of 154. 3 ml (95 % CI: - 324. 7, 16. 0, p = 0. 076), in mean adjusted FVC of 221. 9 ml (95 % CI: - 419. 5, - 24. 3, p = 0. 028), and in FEV 1 /FVC ratio of 2. 0 (95 % CI: - 25. 3, 29. 4, p = 0. 884) among participants who were exposed to arsenic compared to those unexposed. A separate model comprising a total of 160 participants, 60 exposed to arsenic concentrations a parts per thousand yen 250 mu g/l and 100 unexposed at arsenic concentrations of a parts per thousand currency sign 10 mu g/l, showed a decrement in mean adjusted FEV 1 of 226. 4 ml (95 % CI: - 430. 4, - 22. 4, p = 0. 030), in mean adjusted FVC of 354. 8 ml (95 % CI: - 583. 6, - 126. 0, p = 0. 003), and in FEV 1 /FVC ratio of 9. 9 (95 % CI: - 21. 8, 41. 6, p = 0. 539) among participants who were exposed to arsenic in drinking groundwater. This study demonstrated that decrement in lung function is associated with chronic exposure to arsenic in drinking groundwater, occurring independently, and even before any manifestation, of arsenic skin lesions or respiratory symptoms. The study also demonstrated a dose-response effect of arsenic exposure and lung function decrement...|$|R
40|$|My thesis draws {{inspiration}} from three distinct sources - the functional aspect {{of an object}} providing sensual experience, the sculptural quality produced by a personal aesthetic and technical consideration from the maker 2 ̆ 7 s perspective. My creative process involves finding a balance between these three considerations. The choice of wood as the primary material plays a decisive role in providing the sensual experience and visual effect for the work. Smooth wooden surfaces provide sensory enjoyment and warmth, especially on types of furniture that involve intimate body contact such as a chair, bench, or even stair railing. This kind of distinctly human interaction naturally leads me to associate wood with human skin. Additionally, the forms that I create with wood relate to my interest in {{the beauty of the}} human body and the significance of human musculature. The study based on these qualities became abstracted organic forms resulting from the consideration of a construction strategy and possible uses of the form. In the process of creating these organic forms using wood as the building material, I encountered various technical challenges. The problem solving process began with researching existing construction methods while considering the best way to achieve both rigidity and practicality. Consideration also had to be given to the most efficient use of the material. During the making process, as I interacted with each piece, constant intuitive decision- making and improvisation provided unexpected discoveries that were based on my personality and personal experience.

40|$|The {{transport}} of ions {{related to the}} penetration of chlorides into concrete has been studied in the field by drilling 100 -mm concrete cores from a marine bridge column. A 4 -year-old concrete column in Sweden was selected. The concrete was of high quality (i. e., frost- and sulfate-resistant, with a low-heat, low-alkali portland cement with a maximum water-cement ratio of 0. 40) according to new Swedish recommendations. Concrete cores were drilled from the submerged, splash, and atmospheric zones. Selective grinding from the concrete surface(profile grinding) revealed concentration profiles of acid-soluble chlorides, carbonates, sulfates, and water-soluble alkalies. Selected parts of the concrete surface were examined by SEM and thin-section microscopy for microstructural studies. Laboratory estimates of chloride diffusivities were carried out on 6 -month-old laboratory concrete of similar mix proportions, and also on <b>unexposed</b> <b>parts</b> of drilled concrete cores. Chloride diffusivities obtained from laboratory exposure were then compared with the values obtained from the field concentration profiles, from both the bridge column and a field station, using Fick's second law of diffusion. Maximum chloride diffusivities calculated from the field profiles after 4 years of exposure were more than ten times lower than those obtained from the same concrete in the laboratory. Clearly, there are important mechanistic problems associated with laboratory procedures, resulting in serious misjudgments, if such laboratory tests are used for linear extrapolation of the service life for marine concretes. ...|$|E
40|$|Steel {{producers}} {{are forced to}} reduce the production cost {{on the one hand}} and increase the performances of the products on the other hand, to maintain or even increase their market share. A likely method to save on production costs is to cut down the rather long production chain for conventional cold rolled strip, and to substitute certain cold rolled steel grades by hot rolled steel. Certainly this can rarely be achieved for exposed parts, requiring a perfect surface finish, whereas for <b>unexposed</b> <b>parts,</b> e. g. structural components, with lower surface requirements, the use of hot strips might be a cost saving alternative. The aim of this thesis is to contribute to the understanding of the microstructure and texture development of deep-drawing steels during ferritic rolling, subsequent cold rolling and annealing {{on the one hand and}} to appraise the possible improvement of the mechanical and deep-drawing properties on the other hand. On the basis of these results guidelines for the industrial production of ferritic rolled hot strip are proposed. Furthermore, a new hot rolling strategy for the production of hot rolled low alloy TRIP steel is proposed and the development of the microstructure and the mechanical properties to be obtained are investigated in a set plain strain compression test using a hot deformation simulator.

40|$|On Kissing’ at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, 14 November 2008 : Screening Andy Warhol's film 'Kiss' (1964) as a {{historical}} backdrop, the event looked at kissing, both as physical act and metaphor, {{as a gesture of}} exchange or desire, as hidden by the very anatomy of faces and bodies, as playing with the invisible aspects of love. Speakers: artists Melanie Manchot and Wiebke Leister, who will both be presenting new work, writer and curator Lisa Le Feuvre and film historian A. L. Rees. Wiebke Leister's performance consisted of a live reading of her monologue 'Lovers, Liars and Laughter' read by the Shakespearean actor Kenneth Gilbert accompanied by a 32 -piece colour slide projection of the photographs from the series 'Ever After' (23 mins). During the piece each of the eight photographs developed in four stages from either a positive into a negative or from negative into positive – the pale orange skin of the <b>unexposed</b> <b>parts</b> of the colour film not unlike human skin, turning into deep black shadow when developed as a positive. Written in the voice of a young female character, the monologue was read by a white-headed actor in his eighties, as if looking back at an event of his past.

40|$|Hierarchical nanopatterned {{interfaces}} are {{an intriguing}} tool to study clustering processes of proteins like for example integrins that mediate cell adhesion. The {{aim of this}} work {{is the development of}} innovative methods for the fabrication of hierarchical micro-nanopatterned surfaces and the use of such systems as platforms to study cell adhesion. In {{the first part of this}} work different approaches are presented which are suitable for preparing micro-nanopatterned interfaces at a large scale and high sample throughput as required for biological studies. Nanopatterning is achieved by employing diblock copolymer lithography, a method previously reported to be suitable for the fabrication of extended arrays of noble metal nanoparticles by pure selfassembly. The particles are thereby embedded in a micellar shell built up by the polymer, which can be transferred to solid interfaces. Within this work the method has been combined with conventional lithographic techniques to control the particle orientation on discrete areas on the substrate material with single particle precision. Electron beam lithography was used to immobilize gold particles by cross-linking the polymeric matrix with a focused electron beam. The benefits of high precision, single particle deposition and arbitrary pattern design of this technique are opposed by the lack of ability to cover areas larger than a square millimeter in one day exposure time. To overcome this drawback, nanopatterned silicon chips were completely coated with an electron sensitive resist that covered all particles on the substrate. After illuminating the resist by electron beam lithography in desired areas, the <b>unexposed</b> <b>parts</b> including the underlying particles could be removed. Washing off the protecting resist in exposed parts revealed the gold particles pattern. With this technique exposed areas could be increased to square centimeter areas within one day exposure time. As a further approach a new method was developed by exposing the substrate through a metal grid to electrons emitted by an electron flood gun rather than scanning the substrate by a focused beam. Micropatterned areas of several square centimeters could be prepared within minutes, even on non-conductive glass substrates. The three different approaches now provide a toolbox out of which a method can be chosen that suits the respective scientific purpose. Possibilities range from single particle deposition to larger scale arbitrary patterns, that can even be transferred to non-conductive and transparent substrates. The second part of the work, the cellular interactions of rat embryonic fibroblasts (REF) and dendritic cells (DC) with the biofunctionalized micro - nanopatterns produced were studied. Biofunctionalization included linkage of a cell receptor addressing peptide to the nano-particles and a protein repellent layer in between to avoid unspecific interaction. Fluorescent and electron microscopy images revealed, that cellular anchor points are confined to the underlying micro-nanopattern of gold particles. Intracellular actin networks connect to these protein anchor points, forming so called focal adhesions, and thereby mediate mechanical stress. At sizes of the squared adhesive patches of larger than or equal to 1 µm actin fibers connected to one adhesive patch. Whereas, if patterns consisted of squared patches smaller than or equal to 500 nm side length the actin fibers bridged these pattern gaps over several adhesion domains. Patterns with edge lengths of 100 nm comprising 6 ± 1 particles per patch were found to be the minimum number of adhesion receptors that need to cluster in order to induce adhesion. Cell-surface interactions have also been studied with dendritic cells, that play a key role in the immune system since they capture antigens in peripheral tissues and migrate to lymph nodes to present the processed antigen to T-cells and trigger an immune response. In contrast to fibroblasts, DCs were also able to adhere to gold particles that were functionalized with a control peptide that does not address integrins and to particles that were not functionalized at all. Additionally DC adhesion could be induced even on homogeneous patterns with spacings of up to 130 nm. Dendritic anchor points were confined to squared adhesive patches if the pattern comprised edge lengths of 5 µm or 10 µm, but were able to bridge pattern gaps if hierarchical structures consisted of 1 µm and 500 nm adhesive areas...|$|E
