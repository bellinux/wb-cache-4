On 7 March 1964, XS688 became the first Kestrel to conduct its maiden flight, flown by Bill Bedford. The Kestrel had fully swept wings and a larger tail than the early P.1127s, and the fuselage was modified to take the larger 15,000lbf (85kN) Pegasus 5 engine as in the P.1127/Kestrel prototype XP984, in addition to some other changes, such as addition of <b>ultra</b> <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> (<b>UHF)</b> radio and assorted operational equipment in a bay house within the rear fuselage.

The reader’s architecture is proposed and the design details of its RF frond-end are presented. The read range is formulated through calculating the time-averaging power absorbed by the tag and the signal-noise-ratio (SNR) of the demodulation, and accordingly RFID systems can be classified into tag-determining and reader-determining ones. It is concluded that the gain of the reader antenna, the phase noise of the local oscillation (LO) and the receive-transmit isolation coefficient dominate the demodulation output noise of the reader, and consequently the reader-determining maximum operational distance. A prototype reader working at the frequency of 915 MHz was built with off-the-shelf components and was evaluated with a commercial tag in an indoor environment. The measured results show that this RFID system is of tag-determining and has a read range of 8. 4 meters, which are in good agreement with the calculated results. 1...|$|R

40|$|Radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) is an asymmetric radio protocol, where uplink communication (from transponder to reader) {{is implemented}} with backscattering modulation. The idea was first {{demonstrated in the}} 1940 's. One of the first consumer applications of RFID was access control, and key cards based on an inductive near field coupling are widely used even today. The introduction of Schottky diodes to CMOS processes enabled passive RFID, i. e. transponders without a battery, at <b>ultra</b> <b>high</b> <b>frequencies</b> (<b>UHF)</b> with reasonable cost and read range {{in the end of}} 1990 's. This has opened up new applications and inspired new research on RFID. This thesis studies the radio frequency (RF) components and general RF phenomena in RFID at UHF and millimetre waves. The theoretical analysis of the radio path reveals that the read range of a passive UHF system is ideally limited by the downlink, i. e. the power transfer from reader to the transponder. However, the architecture of the reader RF front end is critical, because the transmitted signal may couple a significant amount of noise to the receiver, overpowering the faint reflection from the transponder. In the thesis, two adaptive RF front ends are introduced to eliminate the noise coupling from the transmitter. One of the most critical problems with UHF RFID has been the detuning of transponder antennas on different mounting platforms. The detuning may significantly diminish the read range of the transponder, especially on metal surfaces. In this thesis, two backscattering-based measurement techniques for the transponder antennas are presented. The detuning effect has been studied using these measurement techniques, and a platform tolerant antenna is introduced. RFID at millimetre waves enables miniaturisation of the reader antenna, and widening the data bandwidth over short distances. This could be used to access wirelessly mass memories with wide data bandwidth. A semi-passive or active transponder could communicate, e. g., with automotive radars. The millimetre wave identification (MMID) has been theoretically studied and experimentally verified at 60 GHz...|$|R

40|$|A {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) bore 2 ̆ 7 s structure, loading parameters, and material composition influence {{the ability of}} a radio frequency signal to propagate. Many researchers have tried to create wireless telemetry networks within the MR bore. However, no research has generated a model for bore path loss. The goal of this work is to create a frequency-specific path loss model for the MR bore using electromagnetic theory and experimental results. This model is structured similar to the log-normal shadowing model, which has reference, environmental, and adjustment terms to describe path loss in differing environments. Theory indicates that the MR bore should behave like a cylindrical waveguide or cavity if excited at <b>ultra</b> <b>high</b> <b>frequencies</b> (<b>UHF).</b> Therefore, the path loss behavior, or attenuation characteristic, of the bore should be governed by the mode structure created when the bore is excited by a single tone frequency. The bore should also have improved signal attenuation characteristics when compared to the same signal propagating in free space. The relative path loss behavior of the MR bore is determined experimentally at UHF. An experiment is conducted to determine expected signal attenuation when the bore is empty (air-filled) or dielectrically loaded (patient-filled). This information is especially important to the wireless network designer who is implementing an in-bore physiological monitoring network. A circuit model is proposed as a way to model each mode for the environmental portion of the overall path loss model. This model represents a transmitter exciting an empty bore at the transverse center and longitudinal edge of the bore. Experimental results are used to augment unknown parameters. The circuit model is extended to apply to different transmitter locations by adding reference and adjustment terms. It is also extended to address the addition of the dielectric body to the bore. Results show that the MR bore exhibits impressive path loss performance at 434 MHz, with greatest signal strength arriving at the receiver when the bore is dielectrically loaded. The empty and dielectrically filled bore path loss models predict bore path loss within 1 dB of actual path loss in some bore locations...|$|R

Particularly extracting operations may {{play a major role in}} damaging or removing the tags from the trees.
