500|$|While {{shooting}} the first subway scenes, D'Onofrio's performance was over-the-top and bombastic. Yoshimura {{asked him to}} act a little calmer during the earlier scenes and save the energy for the later scenes, because [...] "if he did go <b>up</b> <b>right</b> <b>away,</b> there was nowhere else {{for him to go}} after that". D'Onofrio agreed and modified his performance accordingly. Fleder also clashed with MacVittie over his portrayal of the Biedron character. Fleder felt that the character appeared too crazy in earlier scenes, and that the actor was telegraphing the twist in which MacVittie {{would turn out to be}} a murderer. MacVittie approached Yoshimura about the criticism, but Yoshimura agreed with Fleder's interpretation. After MacVittie toned down the character's behavior, Fleder said that he was extremely pleased with the end result.|$|E
500|$|Gabrielle Christian first {{auditioned for}} the role of Spencer (then called [...] "Zooey") in July 2004, though Lynch also had her read for Ashley's part. Mandy Musgrave also auditioned {{for the role}} of Spencer, but Lynch liked her {{chemistry}} with Christian, so he paired the two up with Musgrave as Ashley. The pilot was first shot in October 2004 and directed by Rose Troche, but after the series was picked up by The N in January 2005, Lynch decided to recast many of the characters. He said that [...] "I didn't pick [...] <b>up</b> <b>right</b> <b>away,</b> I had her keep re-auditioning. ... I [...] {{to make sure that this}} combination [...] perfect." [...] Her contract was finally picked up in May 2005 and the pilot was re-filmed with the new cast in July. Filming took place in Los Angeles, with a correctional facility used largely as the high school set. Donna Deitch, who directed the second version of the pilot but no subsequent South of Nowhere episodes said that the pilot is [...] "something I'm really, really proud of, because I think that show has a look, a style to it that really helps". She felt that the style she set suited the material and was [...] "fairly inventive" [...] for a low-budget series.|$|E

[...] He played the song on American radio the next day, and in an interview, claimed, [...] "The phone lines lit <b>up</b> <b>right</b> <b>away.</b> Within a couple of days, it was our number-one requested song."

60|$|However, {{as far as}} I {{can make}} out from the books, the King was between the devil and the deep sea at the time, and hadn't much choice. He owed the United States a large debt--a debt which he could pay if allowed time, but time was denied him. He must pay <b>up</b> <b>right</b> <b>away</b> or the {{warships}} would be upon him.

Frederick Henry personally started the siege of Schenkenschans within days of its fall, but soon transferred command to his cousin John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen.
