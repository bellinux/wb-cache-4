5|$|Stefano Ghislotti {{wrote an}} article in Film Anthology which {{discusses}} how Nolan provides the viewer with the clues necessary to decode the sujet as we watch and help <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> fabula from it. The color sequences include a brief overlap to help clue the audience into {{the fact that they}} are being presented in reverse order. The purpose of the fragmented reverse sequencing is to force the audience into a sympathetic experience of Leonard's defective ability to create new long-term memories, where prior events are not recalled, since the audience has yet to see them.|$|E

25|$|To {{choose an}} example that did not get much {{attention}} in the debate (because it was shared by both sides), the Solow-Swan model assumes a continuously-attained equilibrium with 'full employment' of all resources. Contrary to Keynesian economics, saving determines investment in these models (rather than vice versa). The fact that the critique was also stated entirely using exactly {{the same kind of}} unrealistic assumptions meant that {{it was very difficult to}} do anything but 'criticize' Solow and Swan. That is, Sraffian models were explicitly divorced from empirical reality. And, as is very common in debates, it was much easier to destroy neoclassical theory than to develop a full-scale alternative that can help <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> world.|$|E

His reply enables me to focus, I hope with equal clarity and sensitivity, on what remains the fundamental difference in the way each of <b>us</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> contents and significance of what the council had to say about other religious traditions...|$|R
25|$|New advancements in biotechnological {{experimental}} {{methods such as}} the use of Bessel beam plane illumination microscopy and FRET-based sensor molecules can better demonstrate dynamic structures of gap junction plaques. For these experiments, different types of AB5 toxins can be used to induce the fast formation of tCDR in E.Coli cells. The response can then be recorded using cAMP concentration fluctuations in gap junction-coupled cells using FRET-based sensor constructs. Research suggests that CDRs could perhaps be linked with rapid rearrangement of lipids and protein in connexin channels within the gap junction plaques. This can further help <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> signaling cascade that follows a cellular loss of K+ when exposed to bacterial infection.|$|E

2500|$|Mirror neurons are neurons {{that fire}} both when an animal acts {{and when the}} animal observes the same action {{performed}} by another. Thus, the neuron [...] "mirrors" [...] {{the behavior of the}} other, as though the observer were itself acting. Such neurons have been directly observed in primate and other species including birds. The function of the mirror system is a subject of much speculation. Many researchers in cognitive neuroscience and cognitive psychology consider that this system provides the physiological mechanism for the perception action coupling (see the common coding theory). They argue that mirror neurons may be important for understanding the actions of other people, and for learning new skills by imitation. Some researchers also speculate that mirror systems may simulate observed actions, and thus contribute to theory of mind skills, while others relate mirror neurons to language abilities. Neuroscientists such as Marco Iacoboni (UCLA) have argued that mirror neuron systems in the human brain help <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> actions and intentions of other people. In a study published in March 2005 Iacoboni and his colleagues reported that mirror neurons could discern if another person who was picking up a cup of tea planned to drink from it or clear it from the table. In addition, Iacoboni {{and a number of other}} researchers have argued that mirror neurons are the neural basis of the human capacity for emotions such as empathy. Vilayanur S. Ramachandran has speculated that mirror neurons may provide the neurological basis of self-awareness.|$|E

But it is only by such figures that the Bible can make <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> truth, that Christ is the highest being in all heavens and worlds; equal with God the Father, and sharer of his kingdom, and power, and glory, God blessed for ever.

6000|$|I {{have but}} briefly touched upon these things, because, {{whatever}} his words are, I can scarce imagine, that [...] "he, {{who is always}} concerned for the true honour of reason, and would have no spurious issue fathered upon her," [...] should mean any thing so absurd as to affirm, [...] "that {{there is no difference}} betwixt comedy and tragedy but what is made by the taste only;" [...] unless he would have <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> comedies of my lord L. where the first act should be pottages, the second fricassees, &c. and the fifth a chere entiere of women.|$|E
6000|$|THE DOCTRINE OF EMERSON. Since we {{constantly}} hear of [...] "idealism" [...] {{in connection}} with Emerson, let <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> word if we can; or rather the fact, for idealism {{is the most significant}} quality of humanity. The term will be better understood if we place it beside [...] "materialism," [...] which expresses an opposite view of life. The difference may be summarized in the statement that the idealist is a man of spirit, or idea, in that he trusts the evidence of the soul; while the materialist is a man of flesh, or sense, in that he believes only what is evident to the senses. One judges the world by himself; the other judges himself by the world.|$|E
60|$|Recurring, then, to a {{previous}} suggestion, let <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> systems—let us understand each star, with its attendant planets—as but a Titanic atom existing in space with {{precisely the same}} inclination for Unity which characterized, in the beginning, the actual atoms after their irradiation throughout the Universal sphere. As these original atoms rushed towards each other in generally straight lines, so let us conceive as at least generally rectilinear, the paths of the system-atoms towards their respective centres of aggregation:—and in this direct drawing together of the systems into clusters, with a similar and simultaneous drawing together of the clusters themselves while undergoing consolidation, we have at length attained the great Now—the awful Present—the Existing Condition of the Universe.|$|E

60|$|Hence {{in general}} the truths of {{specific}} form are {{the first and most}} important of all; and next to them, those truths of chiaroscuro which are necessary to make us understand every quality and part of forms, and the relative distances of objects among each other, and in consequence their relative bulks. Altogether lower than these, as truths, though often most important as beauties, stand all effects of chiaroscuro which are productive merely of imitations of light and tone, and all effects of color. To make <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> space of the sky, is an end worthy of the artist's highest powers; to hit its particular blue or gold is an end to be thought of when we have accomplished the first, and not till then.|$|E
60|$|Neither is he {{speaking}} only {{of a few}} believers. He says that, owing to the Lord's rising on this day, all shall be made alive--not merely all Christians, but all men. For he does not say, as in Adam all Christians die, but all men; and so he does not say, all Christians shall be made alive, but all men. For here, as in the sixth chapter of Romans, {{he is trying to}} make <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> likeness between Adam and Jesus Christ, whom he calls the new Adam. The first Adam, he says, was only a living soul, as the savages and heathens are; but the second Adam, the Lord from heaven, the true pattern of men, is a quickening, life-giving spirit, to give eternal life to every human being who will accept His offer, and claim his share and right as a true man, after the likeness of the new Adam, Jesus Christ.|$|E
60|$|These {{words are}} {{especially}} solemn words. They stand in an especially solemn and {{important part of}} the Bible. They are the last words of the Old Testament. I cannot but think that it was God's will that they should stand where they are, and nowhere else. Malachi, the prophet who wrote them, did not know perhaps that he was the last of the Old Testament prophets. He did not know that no prophet would arise among the Jews for 400 years, till the time when John the Baptist came preaching repentance. But God knew. And by God's ordinance these words stand {{at the end of the}} Old Testament, to make <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the New Testament. For the Old Testament ends by saying that God would send to the Jews Elijah the prophet. And the New Testament begins by telling us of John the Baptist's coming as a prophet, in the spirit and power of Elias; and how the Lord Jesus himself declared plainly that John the Baptist was Elijah who was to come; that is, the Elijah of whom Malachi prophesies in my text.|$|E
