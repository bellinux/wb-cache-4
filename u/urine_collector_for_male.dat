40|$|With {{care and}} patience, {{complete}} collections of urine and faeces {{can be obtained}} from infants and incontinent children, and metabolic studies to the standards acceptable in adults are practicable. Collection of Urine In 1959, Wilkinson and Baldwin described a disposable plastic <b>urine</b> <b>collector</b> <b>for</b> use in boys and girls. In the light of further experience this has been modified and the new bag is illustrated in Fig. 1. Two sizes of bag are available as before: bags of 8 in. x 3 in., and 12 in. x 4 in., for babies up to 3 months and over 3 months respectively. The new bag differs from the older pattern, first in having no hole for the anus, the plaster being of such a size that it terminates just before the peri...|$|R

40|$|Nutrition {{values of}} silages from {{different}} sorghum cultivars are evaluated. Five 26 -kg castrated crossbred lambs, housed in pens equipped with feces and <b>urine</b> <b>collectors</b> <b>for</b> {{the study of}} their metabolism, were employed in a 5 x 5 Latin square experimental design. Treatments consisted of silage from five different sorghum cultivars: IPA 1011 and IPA 2564 (grain sorghum), IPA 2502 (dual purpose sorghum), IPA FS- 25 and IPA 467 (forage sorghum). Protein level was corrected to 12 % by adding a mixture of urea: ammonium sulfate (9 : 1). Treatments IPA 1011, IPA 2564 and IPA 2502 provided high intake of dry matter, total carbohydrate and total digestible nutrients, and low intake of neutral detergent fiber. Cultivars IPA 1011 and IPA 2564 provided high apparent crude protein digestibility coefficient, whereas cultivars IPA 1011 and IPA 2564 had high total digestible nutrient levels. All cultivars provided positive nitrogen. Owing to nutrient intake and digestibility values, grain sorghum silages evidenced high potential in ruminant nutrition. </p...|$|R
40|$|A simple, inexpensive, {{non-invasive}} method for urine collection {{was used in}} 28 consecutive infants for periods of 48 hours (n = 10) and 72 hours (n = 18). The incidence of <b>urine</b> <b>collector</b> detachment was low on {{the first and second}} days (< 4 %) and increased significantly on the third day (28 %). Volume of urine leaked was < 4 % of the total volume collected daily. This method is applicable to both sexes and is reliable for up to 48 hours...|$|R

Refinements included a <b>urine</b> <b>collector</b> strip on their Clearblue pregnancy test that turns pink to indicate proper urine absorption, thus reducing {{the chance of a}} false-negative test by improper use. A later refinement also replacing the simple blue line indicator with an LCD display that clearly indicates the result, reducing the chance of the test line being misinterpreted by people unaccustomed to using medical test kits.|$|R
