5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, American musical theater {{was a major}} source for popular songs, many of which {{influenced}} blues, jazz, country, and other extant styles of popular music. The center of development for this style was in New York City, where the Broadway theatres became among the most renowned venues in the city. Theatrical composers and lyricists like the brothers George and Ira Gershwin created a <b>uniquely</b> <b>American</b> theatrical style that used American vernacular speech and music. Musicals featured popular songs and fast-paced plots that often revolved around love and romance.|$|E
5|$|The New York {{classical}} music scene included Charles Griffes, originally from Elmira, New York, who began publishing his most innovative material in 1914. His early collaborations were attempts to use non-Western musical themes. The best-known New York composer was George Gershwin. Gershwin was a songwriter with Tin Pan Alley and the Broadway theatres, and his works were {{strongly influenced by}} jazz, or rather the precursors to jazz that were extant during his time. Gershwin's work made American {{classical music}} more focused, and attracted an unheard of amount of international attention. Following Gershwin, the first major composer was Aaron Copland from Brooklyn, who used elements of American folk music, though it remained European in technique and form. Later, {{he turned to the}} ballet and then serial music. Charles Ives was one of the earliest American classical composers of enduring international significance, producing music in a <b>uniquely</b> <b>American</b> style, though his music was mostly unknown until after his death in 1954.|$|E

25|$|After the War of 1812, {{there was}} an {{increasing}} desire to produce a <b>uniquely</b> <b>American</b> literature and culture, {{and a number of}} literary figures emerged, among them Washington Irving, William Cullen Bryant, and James Fenimore Cooper. Irving wrote humorous works in Salmagundi and the satire A History of New York, by Diedrich Knickerbocker (1809). Bryant wrote early romantic and nature-inspired poetry, which evolved away from their European origins.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{influential}} school of thought that is <b>uniquely</b> <b>American</b> is pragmatism. It {{began in the late}} nineteenth century in the United States with Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and John Dewey. Pragmatism begins with the idea that belief is that upon which one is willing to act. It holds that a proposition's meaning is the consequent form of conduct or practice that would be implied by accepting the proposition as true.|$|E
25|$|Insull also {{invented the}} {{regulated}} monopoly, a <b>uniquely</b> <b>American</b> institution that included utility companies and later, AT This {{came from a}} combination of his business persona and his political one. On the one hand, he abhorred the waste of competing power producers, whose inefficiency would often double the cost of production. On the other hand, he believed in the citizen's right to fair treatment. So while he bought up rival companies and created a monopoly, he kept his prices low and campaigned vigorously for regulation.|$|E

Commanded by Hiram Berdan, himself a noted {{marksman}} who had been actively involved in their recruitment - they were thus popularly known as Berdan’s Sharpshooters. Recruited from picked marksmen, employed as snipers and skirmishers - like the German Schützen they often bore their own personal weapons and were dressed (<b>uniquely</b> for <b>American</b> regular military units) in dark green.|$|R
25|$|It can {{be argued}} that superheroes, the <b>uniquely</b> <b>American</b> {{contribution}} to comic books, owe their origin to New York, {{despite the fact that the}} first superhero, Superman, was created by two artists from Cleveland, Ohio. Even when not based explicitly in New York, superhero stories often make use of recognizable stand-ins for the city, such as Metropolis or Gotham City (Gotham being a common nickname for New York). The form and narrative conventions of superhero stories frequently dictate New York-sized cities as the settings, even generically.|$|E
25|$|For the 111 {{years that}} the Militia Act of 1792 {{remained}} in effect, it defined {{the position of the}} militia in relation to the federal government. The War of 1812 tested this <b>uniquely</b> <b>American</b> defense establishment. To fight the War of 1812, the republic formed a small regular military and trained it to protect the frontiers and coastlines. Although it performed poorly in the offensive against Canada, the small force of regulars backed by a well-armed militia, accomplished its defensive mission well. Generals like Andrew Jackson proved that, just as they had in the Revolution, regulars and militia could be effective when employed as a team.|$|E

JNF-USA continues to play an important leadership role in the JNF family and claims to be the largest contributor to JNF-KKL in the world. In 1996, the JNF-USA was accused of mismanaging funds. According to the charges, only 21% of US donations reached Israel, and money was being diverted to Latin American JNF offices. In the wake of this scandal, the North American management was forced to resign.|$|E

50|$|An Act of Parliament in 1825 {{incorporated}} the Canada Company with the Huron Tract settlement objective as its primary goal. The Canada Company received its Charter in 1826, ceased business in 1951 and was dissolved in December 1953. The {{administration of the}} Huron Tract demonstrates the <b>uniquely</b> North <b>American</b> tendency to allocate to private enterprise, functions which would normally have been the Crown prerogative in Britain. Nevertheless, private enterprise and the ruling elite never quite separated {{in the case of}} the Huron Tract, the Canada Company and the Family Compact being almost synonymous until after the Rebellions of 1837.|$|R
25|$|The New England colonies {{were the}} center of early American literature. The revolutionary period {{contained}} political writings by Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Paine. In the post-war period, Thomas Jefferson's United States Declaration of Independence solidified {{his status as a}} key American writer. It was in the late 18th and early 19th centuries that the nation's first novels were published. With the War of 1812 and an increasing desire to produce <b>uniquely</b> <b>American</b> literature and culture, a number of key new literary figures emerged, perhaps most prominently Washington Irving and Edgar Allan Poe. In 1836, Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882) started a movement known as Transcendentalism. Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862) wrote Walden, which urges resistance to the dictates of organized society. The political conflict surrounding abolitionism inspired the writings of William Lloyd Garrison and Harriet Beecher Stowe in her world-famous Uncle Tom's Cabin. These efforts were supported by the continuation of the slave narrative autobiography, of which the best known example from this period was Frederick Douglass's Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1990s, a revival of {{interest}} in the ranch style house occurred in United States. The renewed interest in the design is mainly focused on existing houses and neighborhoods, not new construction. Younger house buyers find that ranch houses are affordable entry level homes in many markets, and the single story living of the house attracts older buyers looking for a house they can navigate easily as they age. The houses' <b>uniquely</b> <b>American</b> heritage, being an indigenous design, has furthered interest as well. The houses' simplicity and unpretentious nature, in marked contrast to the more dramatic and formal nature of neo-eclectic houses, makes them appealing for some buyers. The more distinctive ranch houses, such as modernist Joseph Eichler or Cliff May designs, as well as custom houses with a full complement of the style's features, are in particular demand in many markets. Many neighborhoods featuring ranch-style houses are now well-established, with large trees and often with owner modifications that give these sometimes repetitive styles individual character. As these houses were mainly built in the time frame of 1945 to 1970, they are modern in their infrastructure; their heating/cooling systems, wiring, plumbing, windows, doors, and other systems can all be easily repaired and upgraded.|$|E

50|$|Trade, not politics, {{also served}} as the {{principal}} issue around which various, <b>uniquely</b> Latin <b>American</b> regional organizations were formed after mid-century. On October 14, 1951, the governments of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua signed a new treaty creating the Organization of Central American States (Organización de Estados Centroamericanos, or ODECA) to promote regional cooperation, integration and unity in Central America. This {{led to the creation}} of the Central American Common Market, the Central American Bank for Economic Integration, and the Secretariat for Central American Economic Integration (SIECA) nine years later on December 13, 1960.|$|R

500|$|Although Satin {{argues in}} New Age Politics that Americans {{need to change}} their {{consciousness}} and decentralize their institutions, in Radical Middle he says they can build a good society if they adopt and live by Four Key Values: maximize choices for all Americans, give every American a fair start, maximize every American's human potential, and help {{the peoples of the}} developing world. [...] Instead of finding those values in the writings of contemporary theorists, Satin says they are just new versions of the values that inspired 18th-century American revolutionaries: liberty, equality, pursuit-of-happiness, and fraternity, respectively. [...] He calls Benjamin Franklin the radical middle's favorite Founding Father, and says Franklin [...] "wanted us to invent a <b>uniquely</b> <b>American</b> politics that served ordinary people by creatively borrowing from all points of view." ...|$|E

50|$|International {{indebtedness}} {{turned into}} a severe problem in the late 1980s, and some countries, despite having strong democracies, have not yet developed political institutions capable of handling such crises without resorting to unorthodox economic policies, as most recently illustrated by Argentina's default in the early 21st century. The last twenty years have seen an increased push towards regional integration, {{with the creation of}} <b>uniquely</b> South <b>American</b> institutions such as the Andean Community, Mercosur and Unasur. Notably, starting with the election of Hugo Chávez in Venezuela in 1998, the region experienced what has been termed a pink tide - the election of several leftist and center-left administrations to most countries of the area, except for the Guianas and Colombia.|$|R
50|$|Silk ribbons, {{brought to}} North America by European traders, {{inspired}} a new, <b>uniquely</b> Native <b>American</b> art form. Mi'kmaq people created ribbon appliqué {{as early as}} 1611. In 1789 the regime of the French Revolution decreed that clothing should be plain, so silk ribbons fell out of fashion in France and were exported to North America. Those tribes who traded furs with the French are most known for their ribbon work, such as the Kickapoo, Mesquakie, Miami, Odawa, Ojibwa, Osage, Otoe-Missouria, Potawatomi, and Quapaw, but the practice has spread to many other tribes. Initially, layers of ribbons were sewn {{on the edges of}} cloth, replacing painted lines on hide clothing and blankets. By the close of the 18th century, Native seamstresses created much more intricate appliqué ribbon work designs.|$|R
500|$|Series creator Eric Kripke had {{previously}} {{written for the}} WB series Tarzan, and was offered the chance to pitch show ideas to the network. He used the opportunity for Supernatural, a concept he had been developing for nearly ten years. Kripke envisioned Supernatural as a road trip series, deeming it the [...] "best vehicle to tell these stories because it's pure, stripped down and <b>uniquely</b> <b>American...</b> These stories exist in these small towns all across the country, and it just makes so much sense to drive {{in and out of}} these stories." [...] Though the network rejected his initial pitch—a tabloid reporter investigates supernatural occurrences throughout the country—they were still interested in a series featuring urban legends. Kripke quickly suggested a Route 66-style series, and the network loved it. Filming was greenlit after director David Nutter, who previously had worked with Kripke on Tarzan, signed on.|$|E
500|$|The Western {{was by far}} the {{predominant}} B genre in both the 1930s and, to a lesser degree, the 1940s. Film historian Jon Tuska has argued that [...] "the 'B' product of the Thirties—the Universal films with [...] Mix, [...] Maynard, and [...] Jones, the Columbia features with Buck Jones and Tim McCoy, the RKO George O'Brien series, the Republic Westerns with John Wayne and the Three Mesquiteers ... achieved a <b>uniquely</b> <b>American</b> perfection of the well-made story." [...] At {{the far end of the}} industry, Poverty Row's Ajax put out oaters starring Harry Carey, then in his fifties. The Weiss outfit had the Range Rider series, the American Rough Rider series, and the Morton of the Mounted [...] "northwest action thrillers". One low-budget oater of the era, made totally outside the studio system, profited from an outrageous concept: a Western with an all-midget cast, The Terror of Tiny Town (1938) was such a success in its independent bookings that Columbia picked it up for distribution.|$|E
500|$|Some sources {{suggest that}} Longacre may have based the {{features}} of Liberty on those of his daughter, Sarah. [...] This story would be more often associated with Longacre's Indian Head cent, but {{the features of}} Liberty on both coins (and also the Type I gold dollar, the double eagle, and the three-cent nickel piece) are nearly identical. To help distinguish the new coin from the quarter eagle or $2.50piece, Longacre used a thinner planchet, or blank, to make the piece greater in diameter. [...] He also flattened the planchet of the gold dollar to enlarge it, and gave it the same Indian princess design. [...] The reverse originates Longacre's [...] "agricultural wreath" [...] of corn, tobacco, cotton, and wheat which would also appear on the gold dollar, Flying Eagle cent, and his revised reverse for the Seated Liberty dime and half dime. [...] This blended the produce of the South and North {{at a time of}} intersectional tension.
