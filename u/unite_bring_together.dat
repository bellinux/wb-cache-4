40|$|As we all know, {{some words}} {{have the power}} to open doors (as Ali Baba’s phrase “Sésame, ouvre-toi” in Antoine Galland’s added story to the One Thousand and One Nights) or, more often in our {{everyday}} web-connected life, windows. Working as a confirmation, or counterfeiting, of the “trespasser’s” identity, words can allow access to the virtual caves where we store personal information, financial resources, memories. But words are not only keys. As Seamus Heaney stated, commenting the title of his second book of poetry Door into the Dark (Faber and Faber, London, 1969) : “Words themselves are doors; Janus is to a certain extent their deity, looking back to a ramification of roots and associations and forward to a clarification of sense and meaning. ” If words are doors, then they can open and connect or, on the contrary, separate, hide and deceive, as is the case of the “Morgana door” that the Italian poet Giorgio Caproni used as a metaphor for words: “[ [...] . ] La porta / condannata [...] . // La porta / cieca, che reca / dove si è già, e divelta / resta biancomurata / e intransitiva [...] . / [ [...] . ] / La porta / morgana: // la Parola. ” Drawing textual examples from the works of the two poets, my paper will compare Heaney’s and Caproni’s poetics, focusing on this double, contradictory nature of the word as sym-bolon (sym-ballein: to <b>unite,</b> <b>bring</b> <b>together)</b> and dia-bolon (dia-ballein: to throw apart, separate). info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

40|$|A natural {{consequence}} of groundwater withdrawals is {{the removal of}} water from subsurface storage, but the overall rates and magnitude of groundwater depletion in the United States are not well characterized. This study evaluates longterm cumulative depletion volumes in 40 separate aquifers or areas and one land use category in the <b>United</b> States, <b>bringing</b> <b>together</b> information from the literature and from new analyses. Depletion is directly calculated using calibrated groundwater models, analytical approaches, or volumetric budget analyses for multiple aquifer systems. Estimated groundwater depletion in the United States during 1900 – 2008 totals approximately 1, 000 cubic kilometers (km 3). Furthermore, the rate of groundwater depletion has increased markedly since about 1950, with maximum rates occurring during the most recent period (2000 – 2008) when the depletion rate averaged almost 25 km 3 per year (compared to 9. 2 km 3 per year averaged over the 1900 – 2008 timeframe) ...|$|R

Although social movements differ from pressure groups - as they are generally not centrally organised and reflect broader societal shifts - social movements can <b>bring</b> <b>together</b> elements of various pressure groups and political parties; for example, Green politics in the <b>United</b> Kingdom can <b>bring</b> <b>together</b> pressure groups such as Greenpeace and the Soil Association, alongside political parties such as the Green Party; the Green Party however denies {{that it is a}} single-issue political party, and has a manifesto including a wide range of non-ecologically related issues.|$|R
40|$|Too often basic {{research}} on etiological processes {{that contribute to}} substance use outcomes is disconnected from efforts to develop prevention and intervention programming. Substance use on college campuses {{is an area of}} concern where translational efforts that <b>bring</b> <b>together</b> basic scientists and prevention/intervention practitioners have potential for high impact. We describe an effort at a large, public, urban university in the <b>United</b> States to <b>bring</b> <b>together</b> researchers across the campus with expertise in college behavioral health with university administration and health/wellness practitioners to address college student substance use and mental health. The project “Spit for Science” examines how genetic and environmental influences contribute to behavioral health outcomes across the college years. We argue that findings coming out of {{basic research}} can be used to develop more tailored prevention and intervention programming that incorporates both biologically and psychosocially influenced risk factors. Examples of personalized programming suggest this may be a fruitful way to advance the field and reduce risky substance use...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} airport performance measurement systems under varying ownership patterns in Europe and the <b>United</b> States, <b>bringing</b> <b>together</b> a rich pic-ture of different practices. The need for airports to give greater emphasis to their operational context {{to evaluate their}} performance objectively is emphasized. Many performance measures currently in use are output variables, usually quantitative and based onwhat is easy tomeasure rather thanwhat is important tomeasure. The dysfunctional effects of measurement systems are considered, including the prob-lems of discrepancies {{in the definition of}} key variables and of attempts to achieve direct comparability between airports. This article reviews current practice in the performance measurement of airports andattempts to critique some of the shortcomings of common performance measurement prac-tices used by airports. The pragmatic contexts in which measures have been developed must be recognized. This article represents a reflection on the outcomes of a series of related projects and in addition draws on a series of interviews with air transport managers. The projects were in the areas of airport privatization (see Humphreys, 1999), performance measurement in regu-lated industries (see Francis & Minchington, 1999), and benchmarking in air transport (se...|$|R
