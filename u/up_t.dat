50|$|Athletes in alpine skiing events must combine {{speed and}} agility while racing down the slopes at speeds of {{approximately}} 100 km/h. As in the Olympics, {{there are four}} alpine skiing events: downhill, super-G, slalom, and giant slalom. Downhill events are the only event that is all about speed; athletes complete one downhill 'run' in the fastest time possible, reaching speeds of <b>up</b> <b>t</b> 130 km/h in elite competition. Super giant slalom, or super-G, is also a speed event, but unlike in downhill, racers are required to turn slightly to pass through wide sets of gates on {{their way down the}} mountain. In both the downhill and super-G, athletes have only one attempt to achieve the best time.|$|E

50|$|The Hot Dry Canyons {{ecoregion}} {{is heavily}} dissected by the occurring canyons. Relief (or local relief) can get <b>up</b> <b>t</b> 5,000 ft (1,524 m). Relief {{is the difference}} between the highest and lowest elevations in a given area. Much like the canyons in ecoregion 16c, the canyons here become drier and warmer as depth increases. This region receives little snowfall in the winter. Widespread vegetation includes mountain sagebrush, ponderosa pine, and various grasses. Vegetation on south-facing slopes is less than on north-facing slopes to the increased impact of the Sun due to the Earth's tilt in the Northern Hemisphere. This effect also causes the sites on south-facing slopes to be drier. Douglas-fir can also be found, but is less common than in nearby ecoregions. The bottoms of canyons have been impacted by mining. Some of these canyon bottoms are used as transportation corridors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Most {{protocols}} for multi-party computation (MPC) are secure either against information-theoretic (IT) {{or against}} computationally bounded adversaries. Hybrid-secure MPC protocols guarantee {{different levels of}} security, depending {{on the power of}} the adversary. We present a hybrid-secure MPC protocol that provides an optimal trade-off between IT robustness and computational privacy: For any robustness parameter ρ < n 2 we obtain an MPC protocol that is simultaneously IT secure with robustness for <b>up</b> to <b>t</b> ≤ ρ actively corrupted parties, IT secure with fairness (no robustness) for <b>up</b> to <b>t</b> < n 2 and computationally secure with agreement on abort (no fairness) for <b>up</b> to <b>t</b> < n − ρ. Our construction is secure in the universal composability (UC) framework (with broadcast and CRS), and achieves the bounds of Ishai et al. [CRYPTO’ 06], Katz [STOC’ 07], and Cleve [STOC’ 86] on trade-offs between robustness and privacy, and on fairness. For example, in the special case ρ = 0 our protocol simultaneously achieves non-robust MPC for <b>up</b> to <b>t</b> < n corrupted parties in the computational setting (like Goldreich et al. [STOC’ 87]) while providing security with fairness in the IT setting for <b>up</b> to <b>t</b> < n 2 corrupted parties (like Rabin and Ben-Or [STOC’ 89] though without robustness). A crucial technique in our construction is player emulation, first suggested by Chaum [CRYPTO’ 89]. In this work we provide a formal and detailed treatment of emulated players in the UC setting...|$|R
