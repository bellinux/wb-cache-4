25|$|These earlier Greek {{ideas of}} numbers were later upended by the {{discovery}} of the irrationality of the square root of two. Hippasus, a disciple of Pythagoras, showed that the diagonal of a <b>unit</b> <b>square</b> was incommensurable with its (unit-length) edge: in other words he proved there was no existing (rational) number that accurately depicts the proportion of the diagonal of the <b>unit</b> <b>square</b> to its edge. This caused a significant re-evaluation of Greek philosophy of mathematics. According to legend, fellow Pythagoreans were so traumatized by this discovery that they murdered Hippasus to stop him from spreading his heretical idea. Simon Stevin {{was one of the first}} in Europe to challenge Greek ideas in the 16thcentury. Beginning with Leibniz, the focus shifted strongly to the relationship between mathematics and logic. This perspective dominated the philosophy of mathematics through the time of Frege and of Russell, but was brought into question by developments in the late 19th and early 20thcenturies.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is clear}} that if one permits similarities, any two squares in the plane become {{equivalent}} even without further subdivision. This motivates restricting one's attention to the group SA2 of area-preserving affine transformations. Since the area is preserved, any paradoxical decomposition of a square {{with respect to this}} group would be counterintuitive for the same reasons as the Banach–Tarski decomposition of a ball. In fact, the group SA2 contains as a subgroup the special linear group SL(2,R), which in its turn contains the free group F2 with two generators as a subgroup. This makes it plausible that the proof of Banach–Tarski paradox can be imitated in the plane. The main difficulty here {{lies in the fact that}} the <b>unit</b> <b>square</b> is not invariant under the action of the linear group SL(2, R), hence one cannot simply transfer a paradoxical decomposition from the group to the square, as in the third step of the above proof of the Banach–Tarski paradox. Moreover, the fixed points of the group present difficulties (for example, the origin is fixed under all linear transformations). This is why von Neumann used the larger group SA2 including the translations, and he constructed a paradoxical decomposition of the <b>unit</b> <b>square</b> with respect to the enlarged group (in 1929).
