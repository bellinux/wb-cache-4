2500|$|Water {{releases}} from Benbrook Lake {{are made}} primarily through a [...] gated conduit at the southeast {{end of the}} dam. When waters rise too quickly to be released by this method, then the lake may flow over the <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>spillway</b> at the northwest end of the dam. This spillway is a [...] concrete weir with a , [...] notch in its center. As of 2005, there have only been five occasions on which the lake has been high enough for water to come over the spillway and through this notch. The lake has never been high enough {{to go over the}} entire width of the spillway, which is to be expected as the spillway was designed that this should happen only during a 100-year flood event.|$|E
