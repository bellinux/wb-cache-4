5|$|As Lois finds Chris and {{his friends}} {{watching}} a pornographic film, she becomes convinced a proper sex-ed class should be taught at his school. Since the sex-ed class at her children's school was removed, Lois decides to become the school's newest sex-ed teacher. In class, she attempts to teach students about safe sex, but her efforts are ruined by a botched attempt of Peter, who wishes to distribute his views on sex as well. Soon after the first sex-ed class, parental protests arise as Lois taught kids about safe ways to perform premarital sex, rather than abstinence. As a result, Lois is subsequently fired. She {{is replaced by a}} reverend who promotes both premarital and marital abstinence, explaining fictional consequences of intercourse with various questionable examples. The idea appeals to most students, including Meg, who starts a relationship with a fellow student named Doug. In a subplot, Stewie loses a tooth and is told about the tooth fairy. Frightened by the fairy tale, Stewie develops a plan to capture the fairy, not knowing she does not exist. He borrows Herbert's false teeth and provokes Brian's girlfriend Jillian to throw <b>up,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> has bulimia nervosa, in order to collect her teeth as well. Brian, overseeing Stewie's increasing obsession with the fairy, reveals to Stewie that she does not exist, but another scene shows a man named T. Fairy, having an apparent tooth fetish, stealing teeth to roll around in them.|$|E

Ian Walker of AbsolutePunk elaborated on the song's composition: [...] "'I Was Here' is Beyoncé's monument to the ages. The song climbs higher and higher, chorus by chorus, until Beyoncé reaches her apex, delivering some of her best vocals on the album. The lyrics are a bit uninspired, overly triumphant but somewhat humble as the singer contemplates her mark on history. Although she has garnered massive amounts of acclaim through her storied career, Beyoncé is far from satisfied." ...|$|E

Her mother was of French, Dutch and German ancestry and her father {{was the son of}} a wealthy {{manufacturer}} of railway cars and of English descent. Her maternal grandfather's father was Jewish. When Barney was five years old her family spent the summer at New York's Long Beach Hotel where Oscar Wilde happened to be speaking on his American lecture tour. [...] Wilde scooped her <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> ran past him fleeing a group of small boys, held her out of their reach then sat her down on his knee and told her a story. The next day he joined Barney and her mother on the beach, where their conversation changed the course of Alice's life, inspiring her to pursue art seriously, despite, years later, her husband's disapproval. She later studied under Carolus-Duran and James McNeill Whistler. Many of Alice Pike Barney's paintings are now in the Smithsonian American Art Museum.|$|E

500|$|Ellen Southard had {{rounded the}} {{northern}} tip of Wales, passing Point Lynas at 1pm {{on the day}} of the storm. After receiving the pilot on board, she was taken in tow by the steamtug United Kingdom under the command of Captain Griffiths for the final leg of her journey into the port of Liverpool. By 9pm, conditions had become very stormy, and her sails were taken down; by the time she reached Formby, the ship could no longer be steered, and the tow line was also lost. Ellen Southard dropped her anchors, but they did not hold in the ever-strengthening storm. [...] Finding that it was unable to offer further assistance, the tug set off for Liverpool with the purpose of returning with a lifeboat, but was soon grounded, thereby leaving the stricken American ship to fend for herself. By midnight when the storm reached its peak, Ellen Southard was dismasted and grounded on Jordan Flats about a mile from Crosby lighthouse. [...] The waves crashed heavily on her, and she started to break <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> thumped on the sandbank. The crew were unable to signal for assistance until first light as the vessel did not carry any signal flares — in the interim, they lashed themselves to what remained of the ship to prevent being swept away by the heavy sea.|$|E

Behold the Madonna clones—she {{is turning into}} one fine legend." [...] Jeff Sewald from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that [...] "the modus operandi [...] was clear. Madonna was not only selling her music to throngs of teen-agers and adults alike, but she was selling herself and the entire package {{proved to be a}} joy for the 14,500 screaming fans. [...] Madonna's 'Virgin Tour' had torn the cover off Pittsburgh's sexuality." [...] Rachel Lee from The Sacramento Bee felt that [...] "more than any pop star in recent memory, even Boy George and Prince, Madonna is an image. Her hour-long concert here Tuesday night, as professionally performed and well-choreographed as it was, did nothing to give her more dimension than the two already bestowed on her." [...] Arthur Daniels from Lexington Herald-Leader felt that [...] "Madonna looked grim, but the fans were delighted when the blond rock star made her first major concert appearance to kick off her 'Virgin Tour'. [...] She looked blank and did not look <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> passed fans who gathered by the stage door before the show." ...|$|E

[...] The same day, Roberts gave two more exclusive stills to website Digital Spy; in one image, she was smelling roses, while, in the second, she was [...] "playing with a pair of shoes". The video was released on 30 November 2011.

[...] Mendoza found that Roberts was [...] "becoming quite the chameleon" [...] and had [...] "trampled all over her innocent charm to create a sex siren", referencing her transformation throughout her videos. Katherine St Asaph, of Pop Dust, found that the video's low budget had had a negative effect.
