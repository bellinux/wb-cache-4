5|$|<b>Urban</b> {{expansion}} {{has resulted}} in Delhi's <b>urban</b> area now being considered as extending beyond NCT boundaries to incorporate towns and cities of neighbouring states including Gurgaon and Faridabad of Haryana, and Ghaziabad and Noida of Uttar Pradesh, the total population estimated by the United Nations at over 26 million. According to the UN this makes Delhi <b>urban</b> area the world's second largest, after Tokyo, although Demographia declares the Jakarta <b>urban</b> area to be the second largest. The 2011 census provided two figures for <b>urban</b> area population: 16,314,838 within the NCT boundary, and 21,753,486 for the Extended <b>Urban</b> Area.|$|E

5|$|As of 2011, Radstock {{became a}} town council {{in its own}} right. Until then, the town {{was part of the}} Norton Radstock civil parish, which was created in 1974 as a {{successor}} to the Norton-Radstock <b>Urban</b> District, itself created in 1933 by the merger of Midsomer Norton and Radstock <b>urban</b> districts, along with part of Frome Rural District. Under the Local Government Act 1972 it became a successor parish to the <b>urban</b> district.|$|E
5|$|Before {{becoming}} a civil parish, Mossley was a municipal borough. The unparished areas are: Ashton-under-Lyne (municipal borough), Audenshaw (<b>urban</b> district), Denton (<b>urban</b> district), Droylsden (<b>urban</b> district), Dukinfield (municipal borough), Hyde (municipal borough), Longdendale (<b>urban</b> district), and Stalybridge (municipal borough). The status of each area before 1974 {{is shown in}} brackets. An <b>urban</b> district was a type of local government district which covered an urbanised area. Ashton-under-Lyne, Audenshaw, Denton, Droylsden, and Mossley were previously in Lancashire. Dukinfield, Hyde, Longdendale, and Stalybridge were in Cheshire.|$|E
5|$|Between {{two thirds}} and three {{quarters}} of the population live in <b>urban</b> areas. Switzerland has gone from a largely rural country to an <b>urban</b> one in just 70 years. Since 1935 <b>urban</b> development has claimed as much of the Swiss landscape as it did during the previous 2,000 years. This <b>urban</b> sprawl does not only affect the plateau but also the Jura and the Alpine foothills and there are growing concerns about land use. However, {{from the beginning of the}} 21st century, the population growth in <b>urban</b> areas is higher than in the countryside.|$|E

5|$|Conventional {{real estate}} {{development}} and <b>urban</b> planning activities are subject to conflicting interests and positional bargaining. The integrative negotiation approach emphasises mutual gains. The approach has been applied in land use planning and environmental management, but has not {{been used as a}} coordinated approach to {{real estate development}}, city design, and <b>urban</b> planning. <b>Urban</b> design management involves reordering the chain of events in the production of the built environment according to the principles of integrative negotiation. Such negotiation can be used in <b>urban</b> development and planning activities to reach more efficient agreements. This leads to integrative developments and more sustainable ways to produce the built environment.|$|E
5|$|In Manitoba, a {{city is a}} type of <b>urban</b> municipality. The Municipal Act {{stipulates}} that an <b>urban</b> municipality can only be named a city if it has a minimum population of 7,500 residents.|$|E
5|$|In Manitoba, an <b>urban</b> {{municipality}} may {{be named}} a town upon formation. Other than the requirements to incorporate as an <b>urban</b> municipality (1,000 residents and 400 people/km2), the Municipal Act has no minimum population threshold {{to limit the}} naming of them as towns. A town can alternately be named a village or <b>urban</b> municipality under the Municipal Act or a city {{if it has a}} minimum population of 7,500.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the rebels}} had <b>urban</b> backgrounds, and the {{majority}} of those involved in the events of London were probably local townsfolk rather than peasants. In some cases, the townsfolk who joined the revolt were the <b>urban</b> poor, attempting to gain {{at the expense of the}} local elites. In London, for example, the <b>urban</b> rebels appear to have largely been the poor and unskilled. Other <b>urban</b> rebels were part of the elite, such as at York where the protesters were typically prosperous members of the local community, while in some instances, townsfolk allied themselves with the rural population, as at Bury St Edmunds. In other cases, such as Canterbury, the influx of population from the villages following the Black Death made any distinction between <b>urban</b> and rural less meaningful.|$|E
5|$|Not all {{cities have}} a {{distinct}} <b>urban</b> heat island. Mitigation of the <b>urban</b> heat island {{effect can be}} accomplished {{through the use of}} green roofs and the use of lighter-colored surfaces in <b>urban</b> areas, which reflect more sunlight and absorb less heat.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} demographic changes in the state was the percentage of <b>urban</b> dwellers. Between 1910 and 1930, the percentage of <b>urban</b> dwellers (those living in towns of greater than 2500 people) increased by 32%, resulting in 41% of Texans living in <b>urban</b> areas in 1930. World WarII pushed the <b>urban</b> population over 50%.|$|E
5|$|The 1972 {{legislation}} {{came into}} effect on 1 April 1974, {{with the county}} borough ceasing to exist at midnight on 31 March.

5|$|The city spans {{an area of}} , one of {{the largest}} {{municipal}} areas in Israel, even though its <b>urban</b> area is much smaller. In 1993, the city's jurisdiction was , still many times larger than the <b>urban</b> area. The historical site of Tel Arad and the Arad Park (also known as Ran Grove) can also be found within its municipal area, west of the <b>urban</b> core. Arad also has a commercial landing strip located slightly to the south of its <b>urban</b> core. It borders the Tamar and Abu Basma regional councils, and the closest local municipality to Arad is the Bedouin local council Kuseife.|$|E

5|$|The {{northern}} mockingbird is {{a species that}} is found in both <b>urban</b> and rural habitats. There are now more {{northern mockingbird}}s living in <b>urban</b> habitats than non-urban environments, so they are consequently known as an urban-positive species. Biologists have long questioned how northern mockingbirds adapt to a novel environment in cities, and whether they fall into the typical ecological traps that are common for urban-dwelling birds. A comparative study between an <b>urban</b> dwelling population and a rural dwelling one shows that the apparent survival is higher for individuals in the <b>urban</b> habitats. Lower food availability and travel costs {{may account for the}} higher mortality rate in rural habitats. <b>Urban</b> birds are more likely to return to the nest where they had successfully bred the previous year and avoid those where breeding success was low. One explanation for this phenomenon is that <b>urban</b> environments are more predictable than non-urban ones, as the site fidelity among <b>urban</b> birds prevents them from ecological traps. Mockingbirds are also able to utilize artificial lighting in order to feed nestlings in <b>urban</b> areas such as residential neighborhoods into the night in contrast to those that do not nest near those areas. The adaptation of mockingbirds in <b>urban</b> habitats has led it to become more susceptible to lead poisoning in Baltimore and Washington, D.C. populations.|$|E
5|$|There are {{concerns}} raised about possible contribution from <b>urban</b> heat islands to global warming. Research on China indicates that <b>urban</b> heat island effect contributes to climate warming by about 30%. On the other hand, one 1999 comparison between <b>urban</b> {{and rural areas}} proposed that the <b>urban</b> heat island effects have little influence on global mean temperature trends. Many studies reveal increases in {{the severity of the}} effect with the progress of climate change.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} causes of an <b>urban</b> heat island (UHI); for example, dark {{surfaces}} absorb significantly more solar radiation, which causes <b>urban</b> concentrations of roads and buildings to heat more than suburban {{and rural areas}} during the day; materials commonly used in <b>urban</b> areas for pavement and roofs, such as concrete and asphalt, have significantly different thermal bulk properties (including heat capacity and thermal conductivity) and surface radiative properties (albedo and emissivity) than the surrounding rural areas. This causes {{a change in the}} energy budget of the <b>urban</b> area, often leading to higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas. Another major reason is the lack of evapotranspiration (for example, through lack of vegetation) in <b>urban</b> areas. With a decreased amount of vegetation, cities also lose the shade and cooling effect of trees, and the removal of carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|<b>Urban</b> design {{management}} offers prescriptive advice for practitioners trying to organise city planning activities {{in a way}} that will increase sustainability by increasing satisfaction levels. Real estate development and <b>urban</b> planning often occur at very different decision-making levels. The practitioners involved may have diverse educational and professional backgrounds. They certainly have conflicting interests. Providing prescriptive advice for differing, possibly conflicting, groups requires construction of a framework that accommodates all of their daily activities and responsibilities. <b>Urban</b> {{design management}} provides a common framework to help bring together the conventional practices of <b>urban</b> and regional planning, real estate development, and <b>urban</b> design.|$|E
5|$|<b>Urban</b> foxes {{can cause}} {{problems}} for local residents. Foxes {{have been known}} to steal chickens, disrupt rubbish bins and damage gardens. Most complaints about <b>urban</b> foxes made to local authorities occur during the breeding season in late January/early February or from late April to August, when the new cubs are developing. In the UK, hunting foxes in <b>urban</b> areas is banned, and shooting them in an <b>urban</b> environment is not suitable. One alternative to hunting <b>urban</b> foxes has been to trap them, which appears to be a more viable method. However, killing foxes has little effect on the population in an <b>urban</b> area; those that are killed are very soon replaced, either by new cubs during the breeding season or by other foxes moving into the territory of those that were killed. A more effective method of fox control is to deter them from the specific areas they inhabit. Deterrents such as creosote, diesel oil, or ammonia can be used. Cleaning up and blocking access to den locations can also discourage a fox's return.|$|E
