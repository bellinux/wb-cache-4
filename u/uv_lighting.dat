40|$|Wood-plasticlumber is {{promoted}} as a low-maintenance high-durability product. After weathering, however, wood-plasticcomposites (WPCs) often fide and lose mechanical properties. In {{the first part}} ofthis study, 50 % wood-flour-filled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) composite samples were injection molded or extruded. Composites were exposed to two accelerated weathering cycles in a xenon-arc type weathering apparatus; either ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> <b>light</b> only or <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> and water spray. The composites lightened less when they were exposed to only <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> compared with exposure to <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> and water spray. The change in modulus of elasticity (MOE) and strength was also much less when the composites were exposed to <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> only. The {{second part of the}} study involved stabilizing the WPCs with an ultraviolet absorber and or pigment. The stabilized composites were also exposed to the two weathering cycles. Again the amount of lightening and loss in mechanical properties was less when the composites were exposed to <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> only compared with exposure to <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> and water spray. The pigment was more effective than the ultraviolet absorber retaining composite properties. The pigment had a larger impact on property retention when the composites were exposed to <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> and water spray. The results of this study demonstrate that exposing WPCs to water spray in combination with <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> is more severe than exposing WPCs to only <b>UV</b> <b>light.</b> This is likely a result of the water spray washing away the degraded layer and wood extractives during weathering, as well as causing the wood-plastic interface to be compromised through dimensional changes in the wood particles...|$|R
30|$|As a conclusion, the CuO NWs {{have been}} {{successfully}} grown by using thermal oxidation method which is cheap, simple, and non-catalyst method. Hydrogen gas sensor {{with the assistance of}} <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> has been successfully fabricated. The dominant role of <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> is to enhance the gas sensing properties for room temperature and 100  °C. The stability of the gas sensor is very good at 100  °C where it is in elevated operating temperature. With the irradiation of <b>UV</b> <b>light,</b> sensor could achieve stability in the first cycle compared to sensor without <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> which required about 10  cycles to achieve stability at initial stage. The sensor response also increases with the assistance of <b>UV</b> <b>light.</b> Therefore, we are not required to use higher operating temperature which consumes high power. Besides that, we have found that the sensor with irradiation of <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> has a great potential to operate at low temperature (room temperature) which can reduce the loss power consumption. The stability and sensor response increase with the assistance of <b>UV</b> <b>light.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of {{fluorescent}} inspection, the inspector will use ultraviolet radiation with an intensity appropriate to {{the intent of the}} inspection operation. This must take place in a dark room to ensure good contrast between the glow emitted by the penetrant in the defected areas and the unlit surface of the material. The inspector carefully examines all surfaces in question and records any concerns. Areas in question may be marked so that location of indications can be identified easily without the use of the <b>UV</b> <b>lighting.</b> The inspection should occur at a given point in time after the application of the developer.

40|$|Murine {{epidermis}} {{contains two}} types of bone marrow-derived cells of the immune system, Langerhans' cells (LC), which are dendritic antigen-presenting cells, and Thy- 1 + dendritic cells (Thy- 1 + DEC), which express the gamma/delta T-cell receptor for antigen and hence are probably T cells whose function in the epidermis is unknown. Ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> <b>light</b> greatly reduces the density of both of these cell types, and hence this {{may be one of}} the mechanisms by which <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> induces immunosuppression. It is important to develop strategies for protecting these cells from the effects of <b>UV</b> <b>light.</b> In this study we show that topical all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) and an orally administered retinoid, temarotene, protect both LC and Thy- 1 + DEC from being depleted by <b>UV</b> <b>light.</b> However, neither retinoid inhibited the development of immunosuppression in response to application of a contact sensitizer. We also compared two congenic mouse strains, one albino, the other lightly pigmented and capable of tanning in response to <b>UV</b> <b>light.</b> There was no difference in the ability of <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> to deplete LC or Thy- 1 + DEC in these two strains or of retinoids to inhibit their depletion.

50|$|Due to {{its small}} size, the {{common musk turtle}} {{generally}} makes a better choice for a pet turtle than other commonly available species, such as the red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans). Throughout their range, wild-caught specimens are commonly available, but the species is also frequently captive-bred specifically for the pet trade. (In the United States, USDA regulations ban the sale of turtles under four inches long as pets. This technically excludes most musk turtles, as most specimens found are smaller than 4 inches.) They readily accept a diet of commercially available turtle pellets, algae wafers, and various insects, such as crickets, snails, mealworms, bloodworms, earthworms. A varied diet is essential to a captive turtle's health {{and it is important}} to note that it should not be fed with turtle pellets only. A captive turtle being fed a high protein diet may develop vitamin A and E deficiencies. Supplemental calcium in the form of commercial powders or a cuttle bone is also a must. Aquatic plants (water lettuce, duckweed, etc.) can also be provided, as some musk turtles prefer more vegetables in their diet than others. Though less sensitive to limited access to <b>UV</b> <b>lighting,</b> common musk turtles require ultraviolet (UVA and UVB) lighting as most other turtle species do for proper captive care. As bottom dwellers, musk turtles are rarely seen basking, but a basking area should still be provided.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn earlier report {{describing}} {{a lack of}} compensation to imposed myopic and hyperopic defocus in chicks reared in <b>UV</b> <b>lighting</b> {{has led to the}} belief that the spatial resolving power of the UV cone photoreceptor network in chicks is not capable of decoding optical defocus. However this study used dim light rearing conditions, of less than 10 lx. The purpose of the current study was to determine if emmetropization is possible in young chicks reared under higher luminance, <b>UV</b> <b>lighting</b> conditions. Young, 4 day-old chicks were reared under diurnal near UV (390 nm) illumination set to either 20 or 200 lx while wearing a monocular defocusing lens (+ 20, + 10, − 10 or − 20 D), for 7 days. Similarly treated control groups were reared under diurnal white lighting (WL) of matching illuminance. The WL and UV LED sources were set to equivalent illuminances, measured in “chick lux”, calculated from radiometer readings taken through appropriate narrow band interference filters, and a mathematical model of the spectral sensitivity of the chick visual system. High resolution A-scan ultrasonography was undertaken on days 0 (before lenses were fitted), 2, 4, and 7 to track ocular dimensions and refractive errors were measured by retinoscopy on days 0 and 7. Compensation to negative lenses was unaffected by UV illuminance levels, with near full compensation being achieved under both conditions, as well as under both WL conditions. In contrast, compensation to the positive lenses was markedly impaired in 20 lx <b>UV</b> <b>lighting,</b> with increased instead of decreased axial elongation along with a myopic refractive shift being recorded with the + 10 D lens. Compensation under both WL conditions was again near normal for the + 10 D lens. However, with the + 20 D lens, myopic shifts in refractive error were observed under both dim UV and WL conditions. The spatial resolving power of the UV cone photoreceptor network in the chick is sufficient to detect optical defocus and guide the emmetropization response, provided illumination is sufficiently high. However, compensation to imposed myopic defocus may be compromised, when either the amount of defocus is very high or illumination low, especially when the wavelength is restricted to the UV range...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Nests {{are built}} in various animal taxa {{including}} fish. In systems with exclusive male parental care, {{the choice of}} a nest site may be an important component of male fitness. The nest site may influence male attractiveness as a mate, and male, embryo, and juvenile survival probabilities. Reproductively active three-spined stickleback males establish and defend a territory in which they build a nest. Territories can differ remarkably in qualities that influence male and female reproductive success like predation risk or abiotic factors such as dissolved oxygen concentration or lighting conditions. The latter may be important because in sticklebacks the extended visual capability into the ultraviolet (UV) wave range plays a role in female mate choice. Males are thus expected to be choosy about the habitat in which they will build their nest. Results We tested nest-site choice in male three-spined sticklebacks with respect to different <b>UV</b> <b>lighting</b> conditions. Reproductively active males were given the simultaneous choice to build their nest either in an UV-rich (UV+) or an UV-lacking (UV-) environment. Males exhibited no significant nest-site preferences with respect to UV+ or UV-. However, larger males and also heavier ones completed their nests earlier. Conclusion We found that UV radiation as well as differences in luminance had no influence on nest-site choice in three-spined sticklebacks. Males that built in the UV-rich environment were not different in any trait (body traits and UV reflection traits) from males that built in the UV-poor environment. There was a significant effect of standard length and body mass on the time elapsed until nest completion in the UV experiment. The larger and heavier a male, the faster he completed his nest. In the brightness control experiment there was a significant effect only of body mass on the duration of nest completion. Whether nest building preferences with respect to <b>UV</b> <b>lighting</b> conditions are context dependent needs to be tested for instance by nest-site choice experiment under increased predation risk. </p...|$|E
