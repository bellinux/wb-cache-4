50|$|Several {{nations have}} used {{cultural}} relativism as {{a justification for}} limiting the rights in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, despite World Conference on Human Rights rejects it as a refugee of human rights violations. A 2011 study by international legal expert Roger Lloret Blackburn, examining the <b>Universal</b> <b>Periodic</b> <b>Reviews,</b> distinguishes several different groups of nations. One group consists of nations where the current regime has been installed by revolution and that deny the need for political plurality: China, Vietnam, Myanmar, Cuba and Iran. Another group are certain Islamic nations that adhere to Sharia and certain traditional practices: Yemen, Iran, Pakistan. A third possible group is nations that give special rights to specific groups: Malaysia, Mexico, Indonesia, and Colombia.|$|R

25|$|New Zealand’s National Report for the <b>Universal</b> <b>Periodic</b> <b>Review</b> {{provides}} {{a section on}} Tokelau which states that statistical information {{in regards to the}} health levels of Tokelauan’s is unavailable making it difficult to understand the status of health issues such as obesity and disease rates. The report also outlined Tokelau’s biggest challenge in providing health care is attracting medically trained staff to come and work in Tokelau. This challenge was largely attributed to being so isolated from other countries. The World Health Organisation has recognised that the flow on effects from having recruitment issues has led to health workers having to run the hospital and become accountable for a vast amount of high level duties.|$|E

500|$|Many {{human rights}} groups, however, doubted the {{efficacy}} of the proposed reforms, saying that the new laws would only help minor criminals and not help political prisoners, and that the reforms would not actually abolish the re-education through labor system. [...] The Laogai Research Foundation stated that lowering the maximum length of detention and changing the names of the detention facilities would not constitute a [...] "fundamental change". Nine months after the declaration that the laws would be rewritten, the re-education through labor system had not been abolished; in December 2007, a group of academics drafted an open letter to the government calling {{for an end to the}} system. [...] During the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, there were reports that some individuals applying for permits to protest were detained without trial; of these, some were sentenced to re-education through labor. In the United Nations Human Rights Council's September 2008 <b>Universal</b> <b>Periodic</b> <b>Review</b> of the People's Republic of China, re-education through labor was listed as an [...] "urgent human rights concern," [...] and as of February 2009 there remains a large number of active facilities.|$|E

2500|$|The UN Commission on Human Rights (the {{predecessor}} of the HRC) {{established the}} mandate for the Special Rapporteur {{on the situation}} {{of human rights in}} the DPRK in 2004, issuing reports annually. North Korea did not cooperate with this mandate. In addition, in 2009, the DPRK government was the first state to not accept any of the 167 recommendations received from the adoption of its first <b>Universal</b> <b>Periodic</b> <b>Review</b> (a review on human rights conducted by the HRC on all UN members). Both the Special Rapporteur and the UN human rights commissioner [...] denounced grave violations, with the latter saying that the situation in the DPRK was “the worst in the whole world”.|$|E
2500|$|This {{pressure}} during mid {{and late}} 2014 led North Korea {{to change its}} stance, with its Foreign Minister going to the General Assembly {{for the first time}} in 15 years.

The government changed its previous stance of complete rejection of external critique on its human rights, accepting a large part of the recommendations and claiming they were being implemented. Shortly after, during the second cycle of the UPR, 268 recommendations were issued to advance the DPRK's human rights. The DPRK again accepted some of them. However, in both instances it excluded from consideration or redress the most serious violations, including those deemed by the COI to have crossed “the high threshold of crimes against humanity.” ...|$|E
