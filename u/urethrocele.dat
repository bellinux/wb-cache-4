2500|$|Gomoiu {{published}} steadily, {{and also}} lectured at the Medical Students' Society and the Surgical Society. Topics included meningoencephalitis, cerebral atrophy, facial nerve paralysis, fibrous tissue neoplasm, lipoma, {{the anatomy of}} the endothelium, corneal transplantation, skin grafting, dental implants, hysterectomy, various types of cysts and [...] "rare tumors", and talus bone expulsion. These works were taken up in Eraclie Sterian's magazine, Spitalul, of which Gomoiu was co-editor, or published as brochures. His doctoral thesis, on facial anaplasia, was awarded a magna cum laude in 1909, and published the same year. It was followed in 1910 by Gomoiu's introduction to inguinal hernia surgery, his reviews of surgery as applied to genital tuberculosis, vaginal hydrocele, <b>urethrocele,</b> and varicocele, and a work on the physiological role of cholesterol. A winner of the Manoah Hillel scholarship, that year and the next also saw his first contributions as a medical bibliographer and librarian, with catalogues of entries for the Bucharest University graduation papers in medicine. For his service in the Romanian Army, Gomoiu was concentrated in Medgidia.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>urethrocele</b> ( [...] ) is the {{prolapse}} of {{the female}} urethra into the vagina. Weakening of the tissues that hold the urethra in place cause it to move and {{to put pressure on}} the vagina, leading to the descent of the anterior distal wall of the vagina. Urethroceles often occur with cystoceles, (involving the urinary bladder as well as the urethra). In this case, the term used is cystourethrocele.|$|E

30|$|Material and Methods: There were {{operated}} 73 {{women between}} 2007 and 2011 aged (56 ± 17 years). Cystocele was diagnosed in 32 women, <b>urethrocele</b> with stress incontinence 11, enterocele 9, cervical elongation 7, combined pelvic prolapse 5, rectocele 3, total genital prolapse 6. Prolift® System {{was used in}} 27 cases. TVT™ Obturator System was inserted in 4 women with UroSling which was applied in 17 cases. Transvaginal sacrospinous colpopexy Gyneflex - 25 cases.|$|E

The patient was admitted with complaint of u r inary incontinencea nd a swelling of ventral {{surface of the}} penis, and he {{was found to have}} urethral diverticulum, bladder neck contracture and hydronephrosis. Surgi c al treatment was performed in two stages; the first surgery consisted of the Orr's operation and resection of the bladder neck and the second one, extirpation of the diverticulum...|$|E
30|$|Introduction: The {{surgical}} {{repair of}} pelvic organ prolapse (POP) {{has a major}} role to play nowadays, but due to aging the population {{will be even more}} important in the future. There are many innovative changes in the concept of POP surgery during last decade, especially in new techniques and implants to reach the optimal tissue support. The (POP) is a multicompartmental disorder and usually consists of <b>urethrocele,</b> urethral hypermobility, cystocele, uterine or vaginal vault prolapse, enterocoele or rectocele. The simmilar aethiology explains frequent coincidency of occult or evident urinary incontinence as well.|$|E
40|$|Paraurethral cysts or Skene’s duct cysts are a rare {{cause of}} inter labial mass in a neonate. The precise {{etiology}} of paraurethral cyst is unknown. A thorough urologic evaluation {{was required to}} differentiate it from an ectopic ureterocele, <b>urethrocele,</b> urethral diverticula, and benign or malignant urethral and paraurethral tumors. A day 7 female baby was brought to us with history of asymptomatic introital mass noticed at day 4 of life. It was displacing urethra supero-laterally {{to the left and}} the vagina inferiorly with normal cystogenitoscopy. Simple excision of cyst was done uneventfully. Though asymptomatic, because of cosmetic and parental anxiety, and for a definitive diagnosis, simple excision of cyst was done uneventfully without recurrence...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the durability of}} dorsal free graft aurethroplasty using buccal mucosa in adult recurrent bul-bar and pendulous urethral strictures. Patients and Methods: We treated 40 patients with re-current bulbar and penile urethral strictures during a pe-riod of 4 years. Mean age was 40 years. All patients underwent single stage urethral reconstruction using non-tubularized dorsal onlay buccal mucosa graft. The length of stricture dealt with was {{in the range of}} 2. 5 cm to 12 cm. Follow-up was done at 3 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and then yearhv by uroflowmetry and if required by retrograde urethrogram. Results: Outcome was favourable in 38 patients (95 %). 1 patient (2. 5 %) required VIU. I patient (2. 5 %) died due to pulmonary embolism in immediate postoperative pe-riod. Conclusions: Buccal mucosa is easy to harvest. It has thin and well- vascularized lamina propria with efficient imbibitions. Free graft placed dorsally over the tunica gains the mechanical support of the corpora and obviates <b>urethrocele</b> or diverticula formation. The technique offers the advantages of a fixed well-vascu larized surface with improved graft neo-vasculari-ation, reduced graft shrink-age, and optimum durability of graft...|$|E
40|$|The use of laparoscopically {{introduced}} mesh {{was adopted}} {{in order to}} correct all pelvic floor disorders, however today laparoscopic prostheses tend to be used increasingly for patients with prevailing apical prolapse: III and IV degree hysterocele and/or post-hysterectomy prolapse of the vaginal vault. The co-existence of other defects, for example cystocele and/or III degree rectocele, urethral hypermobility and/or <b>urethrocele</b> with associated urinary incontinence and above all {{the presence of these}} defects in an isolated form, usually indicates a vaginal surgical approach. Therefore the operation in which the application of laparoscopically introduced prostheses prevails is indirect promontory colpopexy (or sacrocolpopexy) and hysterosacropexy. At the beginning of the ‘ 90 s, Dorsey [1] and Nezhat [2] were the first authors to describe laparoscopic sacral colpopexy, with dissection of the vagina anterior to the bladder and posterior to the rectum, in order to apply the mesh to the anterior and posterior wall of the vagina. The method then became widely used and was perfected, and it tended increasingly to be performed together with the laparotomic approach. Wattiez [3] even claims that the laparoscopic approach is better than the vaginal and/or laparotomic approach for the treatment and/or prevention, not only of apical genital prolapse, but of the whole range of pelvic floor disorders. Therefore, considering the growing importance of the laparoscopic prosthetic correction of apical defects, the authors, {{on the basis of a}} revision of the literature, describe the following aspects: rational of the technique, type of prosthetic materials used, controversies regarding the method of application of the mesh and whether or not hysterectomy is also to be performed [...] . ...|$|E
