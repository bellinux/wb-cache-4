40|$|Changes in the {{formation}} of antibodies to sheep red blood cells (sRBC) in the presence of Brucella extracts was studied in mice whose spleen cells were assayed by the Jerne procedure. Two strains of female mice were employed. Brucella extracts were prepared: (i) by trichloroacetic acid extraction (LPSN), (ii) by phenol extraction (LPS), and (iii) by hot acetic acid hydrolysis (Ps). B. abortus LPSN and B. melitensis LPSN or LPS, administered with sRBC, stimulated the specific response to sRBC, but only at high doses of endotoxins. B. abortus LPSN and B. melitensis LPSN suppressed nonspecific responses against horse red blood cells (hRBC), in contrast to the typical events following administration of Serratia marcescens endotoxin (or endotoxins from other <b>ubiquitous</b> <b>organisms).</b> In CD- 1 mice, B. abortus Ps depressed the specific anti-sRBC response. Attempts to presensitize mice with abortus LPSN resulted in a stimulation of the response to sRBC, but pretreatment with B. melitensis LPSN had an inhibitory effect. When injected alone, Brucella endotoxins activated anti-sRBC antibody-forming cells but not anti-hRBC cells. B. abortus Ps was unable to modify the background number of anti-sRBC cells and inhibited the hRBC response. These data suggest (i) that there exists a “common antigen” between Brucella cells and sRBC and (ii) that the so-called primary response to endotoxins from <b>ubiquitous</b> <b>organisms</b> represents a secondary response to already naturally sensitized animals...|$|E

Among proteins increasingly expressed in the presence of PCE compared to fumarate as electron acceptor, a total of 57 proteins were identified by mass spectrometry analysis, revealing proteins involved in stress response and associated regulation pathways, such as PspA, GroEL, and CodY, and also proteins potentially participating in carbon and energy metabolism, such as proteins of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and electron transfer flavoproteins.

In silico analysis of the L. monocytogenes EGD genome identified a putative cell wall-anchored protein (Lmo 0435 [BapL]), which had similarity to proteins involved in biofilm formation by staphylococci. An insertion mutation was constructed in L. monocytogenes to determine the influence of this protein on attachment to abiotic surfaces. The results show that the protein may contribute to the surface adherence of strains that possess BapL, but it is not an essential requirement for all L. monocytogenes strains. Several BapL-negative field isolates demonstrated an ability to adhere to abiotic surfaces equivalent to that of BapL-positive strains. BapL is not required for the virulence of L. monocytogenes in mice. 1494...|$|R

We analyzed whole-genome gene expression in five concentric zones of 5 -day-old colonies utilizing sugar beet pulp as a complex carbon source. Growth, protein production and secretion occurred throughout the colony. Genes involved in carbon catabolism were expressed uniformly from the centre to the periphery whereas genes encoding plant biomass degrading enzymes and nitrate utilization were expressed differentially across the colony. A combined adaptive response of carbon-catabolism and enzyme production to locally available monosaccharides was observed.

The applied importance of nematodes and the experimental tractability of many species have promoted their use as models in various research areas, including developmental biology, evolutionary biology, ecology, and animal-bacterium interactions. Nematodes are particularly well suited for the investigation of host associations with bacteria because all nematodes have interacted with bacteria during their evolutionary history and engage {{in a variety of}} association types. Interactions between nematodes and bacteria can be positive (mutualistic) or negative (pathogenic/parasitic) and may be transient or stably maintained (symbiotic). Furthermore, since many mechanistic aspects of nematode-bacterium interactions are conserved, their study can provide broader insights into other types of associations, including those relevant to human diseases. Recently, genome-scale studies have been applied to diverse nematode-bacterial interactions and have helped reveal mechanisms of communication and exchange between the associated partners. In addition to providing specific information about the system under investigation, these studies also have helped inform our understanding of genome evolution, mutualism, and innate immunity.

40|$|Abstract Endophytic fungi are <b>ubiquitous</b> <b>organisms</b> {{found in}} the plants, {{residing}} intercellular or intracellular, {{at least for a}} portion of their lives without causing apparent symptoms of infection. Almost all plants are known to harbor endophytes. The choice of the plant to be used for exploring endophytes for bioactives is important. Therefore, medicinal plants which are known to be used since centuries as an alternative source of medicine, are a valuable source for bioprospecting endophytes. Nevertheless, due to many reasons there is a dire need for novel resources for novel drugs which can be an answer to many deadly diseases. It is in this context that the present review was envisaged. The review reveals the importance of endophytic fungi from medicinal plants as a source of bioactive and chemically novel compounds. The bioactive metabolites produced by endophytic fungi originate from different biosynthetic pathways and belong to diverse structural groups such as terpenoids, steroids, quinones, phenols, coumarins etc. Endophytes therefore, represent a chemical reservoir for new compounds such as, anticancer, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, antiparasitic, antiviral, antitubercular, insecticidal etc. for use in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries.

Most of studies conducted on aquatic ecosystems with 16 S NGS have been in seawater and lakes. A few studies using NGS have been conducted in river environments and have suggested the presence of a bacterial seed-bank. We performed 16 S highly variable V 4 region high-throughput analysis in the Sinos River, which is located in one of most important Brazilian industrial centers. This region has several contrasts in its environmental characteristics, presenting a longitudinal gradient of eutrophication and making it a remarkable study site for observing the dynamics of bacterioplankton. We demonstrated consistent evidence for the existence of a bacterial seed-bank and its longitudinal persistence. Seasonal shifts reinforce the importance of the source of the river in maintaining the bacterial seed-bank that spreads throughout the river. Therefore, the preservation of the source of the river is important not only for hydrologic reasons but also to maintain the microbial composition and the ecological integrity of the river...|$|E
