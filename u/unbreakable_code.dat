5|$|The Joker is {{considered}} one of, if not, the most-recognizable and iconic fictional characters in popular culture (Batman's arguable equal), {{one of the best}} comic villains, and one of the greatest villains of all-time. The character was well-liked following his debut, appearing in nine out of the first twelve Batman issues, and remained one of Batman's most popular foes throughout his publication. The character {{is considered}} one of the four top comic book characters, alongside Batman, Superman, and Spider-Man. Indeed, when DC Comics released the original series of Greatest Stories Ever Told (1987–1988) featuring collections of stories about heroes like Batman and Superman, the Joker was the only villain included alongside them. The character has been the focus of ethical discussion on the desirability of Batman (who adheres to an <b>unbreakable</b> <b>code</b> forbidding killing) saving lives by murdering the Joker (a relentless dealer of death). These debates weigh the positive (stopping the Joker permanently) against its effect on Batman's character and the possibility that he might begin killing all criminals.|$|E

Albert Einstein's work suggested it was possible, {{but it was too}} bizarre, and too contrary to how we then understood space and time, for him to prove. No one could. Until now. Entanglement tells the astounding story of the scientists who set out to complete Einstein's work.

40|$|Following on {{from his}} bestseller, SCHRODINGER'S CAT, John Gribbin {{presents}} the recent dramatic improvements in experimental techniques that have enabled physicists to formulate and test new {{theories about the}} nature of light. He describes these theories not in terms of hard-to-imagine entities like spinning subnuclear particles, {{but in terms of the}} fate of two small cats, separated at a tender age and carried to opposite ends of the universe. In this way Gribbin introduces the reader to such new developments as quantum cryptography, through which <b>unbreakable</b> <b>codes</b> can be made, and goes on to possible future developments such as the idea that the 'entanglement' of quantum particles could be a way to build a STAR TREK style teleportation machine...|$|R

40|$|Recent work {{in quantum}} {{information}} science {{has produced a}} revolution {{in our understanding of}} quantum entanglement. Scientists now view entanglement as a physical resource with many important applications. These range from quantum computers, which would be able to compute exponentially faster than classical computers, to quantum cryptographic techniques, which could provide <b>unbreakable</b> <b>codes</b> for the transfer of secret information over public channels. These important advances in the study of quantum entanglement and information touch on deep foundational issues in both physics and philosophy. This interdisciplinary volume brings together fourteen of the world's leading physicists and philosophers of physics to address the most important developments and debates in this exciting area of research. It offers a broad spectrum of approaches to resolving deep foundational challenges - philosophical, mathematical, and physical - raised by quantum information, quantum processing, and entanglement. This book is ideal for historians, philosophers of science and physicists...|$|R
5000|$|Prophet Five {{was started}} in the 1970s by Oskar Mueller as a project funded by a private foundation. Parts of the project were compartmentalized, but {{it is known that}} the [...] "best and the brightest" [...] mathematicians, linguists, scientists, and cryptologists, {{including}} James Lehman and the father of André Michaux, were recruited to decrypt a section of a 15th-century manuscript known as the Profeta Cinque (Fifth Prophet) which was written in apparently <b>unbreakable</b> <b>code.</b> They succeeded, and discovered that the manuscript referenced proteins, nucleotides and amino acids - advanced genetics apparently ahead of its time. Lehman and Michaux assumed they were being tested, and presented their findings to a committee. The project was shut down and they were sent back to their everyday lives.|$|E
50|$|However, Hawking {{aspired to}} become an author. Her first two novels were Jaded (2004) and Run for Your Life (2005) (also {{published}} as The Accidental Marathon). A few years after she published these novels, her writing style transitioned to children's books, and in 2007, she published George's Secret Key to the Universe, an adventure story about a small boy called George who {{finds a way to}} slip through a computer generated portal and travel around the solar system. This book was written with her father, Stephen Hawking, and his former Ph.D. student, Christophe Galfard, and has been translated into 38 languages and published in 43 countries. A second book in the series was published just two years later and is titled George's Cosmic Treasure Hunt. Two other books have been published in the series: George and the Big Bang in 2011 and George and the <b>Unbreakable</b> <b>Code</b> in 2014.|$|E

50|$|In 1993 {{he became}} United States Permanent Representative to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in Paris, and in 1996 was {{assigned}} the additional job of White House Special Envoy for Cryptography. At the OECD he successfully negotiated the Convention to Prohibit Bribery in International Business Transactions. As Special Envoy for Cryptography, Aaron {{pushed for a}} global standard that would require computer users with high grade encryption to submit keys to their codes for scrambling data to an independent authority, which would hold them in escrow and make them available to law enforcement only under a court order. At the time, he argued that <b>unbreakable</b> <b>codes</b> {{in the hands of}} terrorists would threaten every country's security. However, he was attacked by advocates of privacy rights, who said that the compromise could easily be misused by Governments and corporations. In 1997 he was appointed Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, where ironically he negotiated privacy rules with the European Union on the handling of personal data.|$|R

500|$|The major {{characters}} of the first season were divided between those {{on the side of}} the law and those involved in drug-related crime. The investigating detail was launched by the actions of Detective Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West), whose insubordinate tendencies and personal problems played counterpoint to his ability as a criminal investigator. The detail was led by Lieutenant Cedric Daniels (Lance Reddick) who faced challenges balancing his career aspirations with his desire to produce a good case. Kima Greggs (Sonja Sohn) was a capable lead detective who faced jealousy from colleagues and worry about the dangers of her job from her domestic partner. Her investigative work was greatly helped by her confidential informant, a drug addict known as Bubbles (Andre Royo). Like Greggs, partners Thomas [...] "Herc" [...] Hauk (Domenick Lombardozzi) and Ellis Carver (Seth Gilliam) were reassigned to the detail from the narcotics unit. The duo's initially violent nature was eventually subdued as they proved useful in grunt work, and sometimes served as comic relief for the audience. Rounding out the temporary unit were detectives Lester Freamon (Clarke Peters) and Roland [...] "Prez" [...] Pryzbylewski (Jim True-Frost). Though not initially important players in the operation, Freamon proved a quietly capable and methodical investigator with a knack for noticing tiny but important details, and Prez turned out to be a natural at following paper trails and his persistence when dealing with seemingly <b>unbreakable</b> <b>codes</b> paid off eventually.|$|R
5000|$|On 12-13 October 1918, the {{regiment}} attacked toward {{the line of}} the Aisne (Ayn) River on the right of a four regiment/two brigade attack that advanced the American line and eliminated a German salient south of the Aisne. During this campaign the numerous American Indian members of the old Oklahoma National Guard were used as telephone talkers, becoming a legend as the [...] "Choctaw Talkers", presaging the [...] "Code Talkers" [...] of World War II. Fourteen Choctaw Indian men, trained to use their language, helped the American Expeditionary Force win several key battles in the Meuse-Argonne Campaign in France, the final big German push of the war. The fourteen Choctaw Code Talkers were Albert Billy, Mitchell Bobb, Victor Brown, Ben Caterby, James Edwards, Tobias Frazer, Ben Hampton, Solomon Louis, Pete Maytubby, Jeff Nelson, Joseph Oklahombi, Robert Taylor, Calvin Wilson, and Walter Veach. With at least one Choctaw man placed in each field company headquarters, they handled military communications by field telephone, translated radio messages into the Choctaw language, and wrote field orders to be carried by [...] "runners" [...] between the various companies. The German army, which captured about one out of four messengers, never deciphered the messages written in Choctaw. The Choctaws were recognized as the first to use their native language as an <b>unbreakable</b> <b>code</b> in World War I. The Choctaw language was again used in World War II.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Cryptography {{is taught}} {{with the basic}} rule {{that there is no}} such thing as an {{unbreakable}} encryption because “If someone tries enough keys he is bound to get the right one, ” which gives rise to the basis of the brute force attack. Brute force attack, or exhaustive key search, is a strategy that can, in theory, be used against any encrypted data. It involves systematically checking all possible keys until the correct key is found. One of the measures of the strength of an encryption system is how long it would theoretically take an attacker to mount a successful brute-force attack against it. The so-called Landauer limit implied by the laws of physics sets a lower limit on the energy required to perform a computation of kT and the processing speed and memory requirements also set physical barriers. But with the exponential growth of computing industry supercomputers having computing capacities of 20 Peta-FLOPS and beyond have been made and a number of systems that were originally thought to be impossible to crack by brute force have nevertheless been cracked. A truly <b>unbreakable</b> <b>code</b> must not have an obtainable key. A theory for this is for the code breaker to not realize that he has broken the code even if he has the key. For example, the key and cleartext may change according to a random time variable so that even when the code has been broken the encrypted text could still represent any other meaning. This is however very impractical and has never been able to be put into effect. This paper discusses unbreakability of encryptions and proposes an encryption that can be called truly unbreakable.
