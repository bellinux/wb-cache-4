Untreated <b>unground</b> un-pumiced, <b>unground</b> pumiced, and ground enamel surfaces, as well as synthetic hydroxyapatite surfaces, served as controls for intra-tooth evaluations {{of the effects of}} different treatments. The analyses indicated that exposure to 35 % H 202 alone, besides increasing the nitrogen content, produced no other significant change in the elemental composition of any of the enamel surfaces investigated. Exposure to 37 % H 3 PO 4, however, produced a marked decrease in calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) concentrations and an increase in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations in <b>unground</b> un-pumiced specimens only, and a decrease in C concentration in ground specimens. These results suggest that the reported decrease in the adhesive bond strength of resin to 35 % H 202 -treated enamel is not caused by a change in the elemental composition of treated enamel surfaces. They also suggest that an organic-rich layer, unaffected by acid-etching, may be present on the <b>unground</b> u-n-pumiced surface of young bovine incisors.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the shear bond {{strength}} of several self-etch ad-hesives to their two-step predecessors to ground and <b>unground</b> enamel. Methods: Seventy-five extracted, non-carious human third molar teeth were selected for this study. The buccal surfaces of each tooth were mechanically ground to obtain flat enamel surfaces (ground enamel), while the lingual surfaces were left intact (<b>unground</b> enamel). The teeth were ran-domly divided into five groups according to the adhesive systems (n= 15) : one-step self-etch adhesive- Clearfil S 3 Bond, its two-step predecessor- Clearfil SE Bond, one-step self-etch adhesive- Ad-heSE One, and its two-step predecessor- AdheSE, and a two-step etch-and-rinse adhesive- Adper Single Bond 2 (control). After application of the adhesives to the buccal and lingual enamel surfaces of each tooth, a cylindrical capsule filled with a hybrid composite resin (TPH) was seated against the surfaces. The specimens were stored in distilled water at 37 °C for 24 hours, followed by thermocy-cling (5 °C- 55 °C/ 500 cycles). They were subjected to shear bond strength test in a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 1. 0 mm/minute. The data were compared using a two-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni test at P<. 05. Results: All adhesives exhibited statistically similar bond strengths to ground and <b>unground</b> enamel except for the etch-and-rinse adhesive that showed significantly higher bond strengths than the self-etch adhesives (P<. 05). No significant differences in bond strength values were observed between ground and <b>unground</b> enamel for any of the adhesives tested (P=. 17). Conclusion: Similar bond strengths to ground and <b>unground</b> enamel were achieved with one-step self-etch adhesives and their predecessors.

40|$|In {{developed}} countries, {{there is}} a renewed awareness on the utilization of legumes, because they are regarded as versatile functional ingredients that are nutritionally similar to meat and serve as replacements for animal protein. The primary aim of the work was to produce a sun dried Awara (soybean curd) mix that {{will serve as a}} preliminary research base, aimed at providing a readily available, acceptable, and affordable protein supplement when further processed. The mix was obtained by first sun drying a fresh curd of soybean prepared using a standard acceptable procedure. Therefore, 4 / 5 of the dry curd was ground into flour, which was separated into different particle sizes, using sieves with pore diameters of 250 µ, 180 µ, 132 µ, and 118 µ respectively. The remaining 1 / 5 th of the dried curd was left <b>unground.</b> It was observed that the flours from 250 µ and 180 µ aperture sizes did not form curds after reconstitution, due to lack of cohesion. However, flours from aperture sizes of 132 µ, 118 µ and the <b>unground</b> flour formed curds of increasing cohesion respectively. This indicated that the <b>unground</b> flour has higher cohesion ability than the other flours, therefore less tendency to scatter during further processing.

25|$|There has, however, been {{interest}} among railroad operators in returning to DC use at higher voltages than previously used. At the same voltage, DC often has less loss than AC, {{and for this}} reason high-voltage direct current is already used on some bulk power transmission lines. DC avoids the electromagnetic radiation inherent with AC, and on a railway this also reduces interference with signalling and communications and mitigates hypothetical EMF risks. DC also avoids the power factor problems of AC. Of particular interest to railroading is that DC can supply constant power with a single <b>ungrounded</b> wire. Constant power with AC requires three-phase transmission with at least two <b>ungrounded</b> wires. Another important consideration is that mains-frequency three-phase AC must be carefully planned to avoid unbalanced phase loads. Parts of the system are supplied from different phases {{on the assumption that the}} total loads of the three phases will even out. At the phase break points between regions supplied from different phases, long insulated supply breaks are required to avoid them being shorted by rolling stock using more than one pantograph at a time. A few railroads have tried three-phase but its substantial complexity has made single-phase standard practice despite the interruption in power flow that occurs twice every cycle. An experimental 6kV DC railway was built in the Soviet Union.|$|E

On wet construction sites or in shipyards, isolation transformers may be provided so that a fault in a power tool or its cable does not expose users to shock hazard.|$|E

25|$|German Schuko {{socket outlets}} were once widely used {{alongside}} the British standard BS546 round pin plugs (both 3-pin and 2-pin varieties). However, {{both of these}} systems were replaced by BS 1363, standardised as Irish Standard IS 401 (Plug) and IS411 (Socket outlet). This standard eliminated incompatibilities between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and was chosen as it was completely incompatible with both the old Schuko or BS 546 installations and encouraged people to rewire their homes {{to comply with the}} new standard. It removed the possibility of connecting Class I (requiring an earth connection) appliances, to socket outlets that are either unearthed (<b>ungrounded)</b> or with incompatible earthing contacts – e.g. 2-pin side-earthed Schuko plug will not make earth contact with a 3-hole, 5-amp BS 546 socket. This harmonisation occurred before the advent of pre-fitted 2-pin plugs on appliances destined for the European 220-volt market, which might have led to a different outcome. Until UK and Irish voltages were standardised at 230 volts in the 1990s, it was common for such plugs to be pre-fitted on appliances destined for the Irish market, although they were prohibited on appliances destined for the United Kingdom market. Both countries now require the pre-fitting of BS 1363 plugs on domestic appliances.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} grinding on the bonding effectiveness of a self-etch and an etch-and-rinse adhesive to fluorosed enamel. METHODS: The teeth were classified using the Thylstrup and Fejerskov index (TFI). Fluorosed teeth (TFI= 5) obtained from Isparta (Turkey) and control teeth (TFI= 0) obtained from Leuven (Belgium) were used. Using a depth-marking diamond bur, 0. 3 mm of enamel was removed from mid-buccal and mid-palatal/lingual surfaces of the teeth, whereas the area adjacent to the ground area was left unprepared. A two-step self-etch (Clearfil Protect Bond, Kuraray) and a three-step etch-and-rinse adhesive (Optibond FL, Kerr) were used to bond the resin composite to the ground and <b>unground</b> enamel. Rectangular micro-specimens were prepared using the slow-speed diamond saw and tested in tensile to {{determine the}} micro-tensile bond strength (muTBS). RESULTS: The muTBS to <b>unground</b> fluorosed enamel was significantly lower than to ground fluorosed enamel for Clearfil Protect Bond (15. 8 +/- 15. 2 and 45. 0 +/- 12. 4 MPa, p< 0. 0001) and for Optibond FL (35. 5 +/- 21. 4 and 50. 5 +/- 12. 3 MPa, p< 0. 05), respectively. In control teeth, Clearfil Protect Bond bonded better to ground enamel (p< 0. 01), whereas OptiBond FL exhibited a similar bonding effectiveness to ground and <b>unground</b> enamel (p= 0. 0634). SIGNIFICANCE: Preparation of enamel improved the resin-enamel bond strength in fluorosed teeth. The bonding effectiveness to <b>unground</b> enamel was lower in fluorosed teeth than in control teeth for the self-etch adhesive tested. status: publishe...|$|R
