40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{economic}} effects of the technological changes {{that have taken place}} recently in international shipping, with particular reference to linear services in Australia's export trade. The new technologies are studied for all ship types - bulk carrier and tramp, tanker, and general cargo liner - but attention is concentrated on the development of unitised liner technology (containerisation and palletisation) and its economic effects in Australia's export trade. <b>Unitisation</b> has affected the liner shipping industry through the Conference system, competition between operators, internal cost levels and structure, and relations between land and sea-carriers. As far as Australian shippers are concerned, <b>unitisation</b> is bringing about changes through new freight pricing procedures, methods of rate bargaining, and trade creation or diversion. The Commonwealth Government has an active policy towards liner shipping, and the introduction of <b>unitisation</b> has affected the nature and efficiency of intervention in the overseas shipping market. It has a particularly marked effect on Australian general cargo ports, affecting levels of investment and causing problems of readjustment in the stevedoring industry. The analysis of these tipics draws support from study, early in the thesis, of the derived demand for shipping services in Australia's export sector and supply conditions in international shipping...|$|E
40|$|A central {{challenge}} for any theory of concept learning comes from Fodor’s {{argument against the}} learning of concepts, which lies at the basis of contemporary computationalist accounts of the mind. Robert Goldstone and his colleagues propose a theory of perceptual learning that attempts to overcome Fodor’s challenge. Its main component is {{the addition of a}} cognitive device at the interface of perception and conception, which slowly builds ‘cognitive symbols’ out of perceptual stimuli. The main mechanisms of concept creation are <b>unitisation</b> and differentiation. In this paper, I will present and examine their theory, and will show that two problems hinder this reply to Fodor’s challenge from being a successful answer to the challenge. To amend the theory, I will argue that one would need to say more about the input systems to <b>unitisation</b> and differentiation, and be clearer on the representational format that they are able to operate upon. Until these issues have been addressed, the proposal doesn’t deploy its full potential to threaten a Fodorian position...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} competing explanations of the processes underlying associative recognition. Like recognition memory for individual items, associative recognition is currently understood through two different classes of model. The first is the single-process model class which holds that associative recognition decisions {{are based on a}} continuum of associative memory strength. The second is the dual-process model class, which holds that associative recognition decisions are based on two sources of information, called familiarity and recollection. Familiarity is conceptualised as a fast-acting, context-free „feeling of knowing‟, while recollection {{is said to be a}} slower, more conscious process allowing for the recall of detail and context. Familiarity may play a role in associative recognition through a mechanism called <b>unitisation,</b> whereby two distinct stimuli are bound into a single individual memory trace. State-trace analysis is a method to determine the number of latent variables or processes that contribute to performance on a set of tasks, under mild assumptions. A critical diagnostic feature is the dimensionality of the state-trace plot – a plot of performance on one dependent variable against the other. If associative recognition depends on a single latent variable then manipulation of experimental factors affecting memory should result in a unidimensional state-trace plot. If associative recognition depends on two or more latent variables which are differentially affected by the experimental factors then a bidimensional state-trace will result. State-trace analysis therefore provides a method of discriminating a class of single-process models from a class of dual-process models. State-trace analysis was applied to associative recognition in four experiments. Each experiment utilised two independent variables that previous research had suggested could differentially affect familiarity and recollection. Experiment 1 investigated associative recognition of word pairs by manipulating attention and study presentation frequency. Experiments 2 investigated associative recognition of word pairs under conditions designed to encourage <b>unitisation</b> by pairing an encoding-based <b>unitisation</b> manipulation with a working memory load manipulation. Experiment 3 manipulated the same <b>unitisation</b> instructions as well as varying study time. Experiment 4 examined the effect of <b>unitisation</b> using pairs of faces and manipulated visual similarity and study time. State-trace analysis of the four experiments consistently revealed unidimensional state-trace plots. Using a recently developed monotonic regression statistical test, unidimensionality could not be rejected at either aggregate or individual participant level. Therefore, no evidence was found for the differential activation of familiarity and recollection in associative recognition. The results of this thesis are therefore consistent with a single-process account of associative recognition. These results also pose a challenge to dual-process models to identify alternate experimental manipulations that reveal the involvement of different component processes such as recollection and unitized familiarity.

40|$|Two {{types of}} {{encoding}} tasks have been employed {{in previous research}} to investigate the beneficial effect of <b>unitisation</b> on familiarity-based associative recognition (unitised familiarity effect), namely the compound task and the interactive imagery task. Here we show how these two tasks could differentially engage subsequent recollection-based associative recognition and consequently lead to the turn-on or turn-off of the unitised familiarity effect. In the compound task, participants studied unrelated word pairs as newly learned compounds. In the interactive imagery task, participants studied the same word pairs as interactive images. An associative recognition task was used {{in combination with the}} Remember/Know procedure to measure recollection-based and familiarity-based associative recognition. The results showed that the unitised familiarity effect was present in the compound task but was absent in the interactive imagery task. A comparison of the compound and the interactive imagery task revealed a dramatic increase in recollection-based associative recognition for the interactive imagery task. These results suggest that <b>unitisation</b> could benefit familiarity-based associative recognition; however, this effect will be eliminated when the memory trace formed is easily accessed by strong recollection without the need for a familiarity assessment...|$|E
40|$|Word {{semantic}} transparency (ST) {{refers to}} the extent that word constituents are semantically transparent (T) or opaque (O) to whole-word meaning. Bimorphemic compound words (compounds) may be fully opaque (OO), partially opaque (TO or OT), or fully transparent (TT). The word-superiority effect (WSE) describes the superior recognition of word constituents in a word, as opposed to a nonword, context. Chinese compounds comprise two written characters with a natural space between compound constituents. It has been shown that Chinese compounds with at least an opaque constituent patterned together and displayed a larger WSE (more word-like) than TT compounds. This corroborated with results obtained with English compounds when a space was artiﬁcially inserted between compound constituents. The present study further examined the modulatory effect of ST on the Chinese WSE by transposing the order of constituent characters; the familiar form of the canonical compounds was disrupted, delaying word recognition until at least the initial constituent (now second character) was processed. Expectedly, OO items appeared more word-like than TT items. However, partially opaque items were not as word-like as OO items, especially when the T constituent was the ﬁnal constituent (now ﬁrst character). Taken together with previous results, the effect of ST on Chinese whole-word lexical <b>unitisation</b> appears graded but with a bias toward <b>unitisation</b> wherever there is an opaque element. These results provided a window into how lexical learning and representation is sensitive to language-speciﬁc, script-related variations...|$|E

40|$|The Jiang-Su algebra Z and {{the notion}} of Z-stability (i. e. {{tensorial}} absorption of the Jiang-Su algebra) are now widely acknowledged to be of particular importance in the classification and structure theory of separable nuclear C*-algebras. The key results in this thesis are early attempts to explore Z-stability outside the constraints of unital and of nuclear C*-algebras. Standard unitisations of a separable Z-stable C*-algebra are not Z-stable and we therefore explore possible unitisations that preserve Z-stability. We construct the minimal Z-stable <b>unitisation</b> of a separable Z-stable C*-algebra and show that it satisfies an appropriate universal property. An interesting area in which to exploit Z-stability outside of the context of nuclear C*-algebras is the so-called Kadison’s similarity problem. We show that the tensor product of two separable unital C*-algebras has Kadison’s similarity property if one of them is nuclear and admits a unital *-homomorphism from (the building blocks of) the Jiang-Su algebra. An immediate consequence of this is that any separable unital Z-stable C*-algebra also has this property...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{bilateral}} state {{practice on}} joint development of straddling petroleum deposits across their common borders has attracted avid commentaries across the globe. This growing interest is further {{reinforced by the}} fact that more and more discoveries of straddling offshore petroleum resources across states boundaries are being made regularly. These deposits either lie across delimited continental shelf boundaries or are found in areas of overlapping continental shelf claims. However, the international legal regime governing such deposits only requires states to cooperate in developing such common hydrocarbon deposits. Such obligation within the context of customary international law has been described as no more than mere “rules of engagement ” rather than rules of cooperation. Consequently, the tendency for states to fail to cooperate is ever-present. The question then is: What options are there for the states in the event of failure to reach an agreement on trans-boundary <b>unitisation?</b> The main thrust of this paper therefore is to analyse the options opened to states where no cooperative agreement on joint development of common deposits is reached...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{electricity}} market deregulation, the techniques used for load forecasting have gradually improved over the years. Deregulation {{in the power}} system industry has caused rising requirement in planning, operating and controlling electric energy systems, which brings electricity load forecasting to a crucial level. Therefore, adequate techniques are desired for accurately predicting the load and hence assisting power companies in generating capacity scheduling, maintenance, energy planning and procurement, etc. An accurate forecast can greatly help power distribution companies to improve their electricity marketing strategies and avoid over or under <b>unitisation</b> of generating capacity and therefore optimises energy prices. But, to predict the load demand in real time requires {{a considerable amount of}} efforts. This paper presents a design methodology for a short term load forecasting useful for distribution companies, which are capable of interacting with users, gathering historical load data, performing a statistical analysis on the historical data and plotting graphs of the predicted load using the support vector machine (SVM).

This has implications for the balance between quantitative and qualitative methodologies in achieving a meaningful context for interpreting numbers-based cultural data, as well as for the management of reporting regimes – the process by which value is “conferred” – by individual cultural organisations and events. It concludes with a brief sketch of a new set of priorities for assessment processes based on a less unitized, more cooperative understanding of cultural value (a Total Cultural Value exercise) Design/methodology/approach – This paper is a keynote address from the Global Events Congress. Findings – Valuation processes are comparative processes. They involve benchmarking, standardisation, <b>unitisation</b> and ranking. Cultural activities have an incommensurable aspect that makes them resist this kind of assessment and not infrequently make a nonsense of it. This makes it difficult for policy makers to choose between them from a resource perspective. No new proof of worth is going to change this fundamental characteristic of culture. A Total Cultural Value exercise is “allocutionary” and helps cultural programmes “make a case” based on best use of the available data and a meta-cognitive appreciation of the biases different proofs of worth involve.

40|$|This {{study used}} an interpretative {{qualitative}} multi-case study approach. Three frameworks were {{chosen as the}} underpinning theoretical frameworks due to their emerging relevance: 1) Hansen and Nohria’s (2004) Four Barriers to Collaborative Advantage, to examine individual engagement; 2) Mohr and Nevin’s (1990) Communication Strategies to investigate communication practices; and 3) MacCormack et al’s (2007) Four Pillars of Collaborative Capabilities as a lens for chain architecture. These frameworks were also chosen explicitly for how they fit together {{for the purpose of}} addressing the research question. Participants were purposively sampled from three global agri-chains. Data were collected by interviewing 29 employees about their co-innovation projects and practices using convergent interviewing. Audio recordings were transcribed in N-Vivo for categorisation, coding and <b>unitisation.</b> Excel matrices and tables were used to draw conclusions and theory development. The collaborative chain participants showed greater willingness to collaborate and were better able to transfer tacit knowledge than the trading chain. The communication styles reported to be utilised in successful co-innovation projects were bi-directional, informal, indirect, transparent and face to face. None of the chains significantly organised their people, processes or platforms for collaboration however, the collaborative chains did take a programmed approach to co-innovation. The most significant contribution of this thesis is the proposed integrated model on how to establish co-innovation facilitators in global agri-chains. It is suggested that the collaborative practices influence co-innovation through three broad co-innovation facilitators: 1) strengthening chain relationships; 2) improving information exchange; and 3) creating a coinnovative environment...|$|E
40|$|Extract] Objectives: This study {{investigated}} the role that semantic transparency – the degree of transparency in the semantic relationship between a compound word and its constituents – plays in Chinese compound word representation. Design: Bimorphemic (bicharacter) compounds were classified as either fully opaque, i. e. semantically opaque at both constituents (OO), partially opaque (TO, or OT), or fully transparent (TT). Word frequency (high or low) was manipulated and both character positions were tested. Inferences about lexical organisation were made within a modified Reicher-Wheeler paradigm, in which the word-superiority effect (word–non-word) has been observed. Both words and reversed compounds were compared to nonwords in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Methods: Participants were university students (aged 18 to 34 years) and proficient in Chinese. Stimuli were Chinese compounds, their reverse and matching nonwords. Each stimulus was tachistoscopically presented and the task was partial report (of the character at the designated position). Analysis: Percentage correct was calculated and difference scores (word/reversed compound– non-word) were cast as a three-way ANOVA. In Experiment 1, the word-superiority effect obtained, regardless of semantic transparency, word frequency and character position, especially for low-frequency words {{with at least one}} opaque constituent. In Experiment 2, there was an advantage to the first constituent of reversed compounds, but only for high-frequency words with two opaque constituents. Conclusions: These results suggested that the degree of <b>unitisation</b> in lexical representation goes in the decreasing order of fully opaque compounds, partially opaque compounds and then fully transparent compounds. They were explained using a graded approach to morphological representation within a modified interactive-activation framework...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{prospects}} and {{challenges facing the}} Republic of Cyprus in developing {{the discovery of a}} significant offshore gas field by Noble Energy in December 2011. This discovery came close {{on the heels of the}} major discoveries in adjacent offshore Israel, further astounding the international upstream exploration and production community who had largely overlooked the prospectivity of this area. For the Republic of Cyprus, whose economy is dominated by tourism and the service sector and overshadowed by Eurozone economic malaise, this discovery offers lower domestic energy costs and substantial export revenues. However, as is often the case with unexpected fortune, decisions on how best to develop such a resource for the benefit of a nation with a history of inter-ethnic tensions are not straightforward and further complicated by Cyprus’ geographic and geopolitical setting. Anastasios Giamouridis describes the status of the Aphrodite field and juxtaposes the logical process of progressively defining options for the development of the field and the export strategy for gas produced in excess of Cyprus’ modest current and future consumption needs with the rising expectations, not just of the Cypriot government but also neighbouring countries with either aspirations to share in this source of hydrocarbon wealth or openly disputing Cyprus’ sovereign hydrocarbon ownership rights. Anastasios introduces the pros and cons of future <b>unitisation</b> and joint development with Israel and examines the institutional capability of the Cypriot government to guide the monetisation of the resource at a time when it is also focused on Cyprus’s EU Presidency in the second half of 2012. </p...|$|E
40|$|This PhD thesis aims to {{investigate}} the role of human medial temporal lobe (MTL) neurons in the encoding of associations between items and the characteristics of single neuron activity in response to related items. The invaluable opportunity to record single neuron activity occurs when patients suffering from refractory epilepsy have to be implanted with intracranial depth electrodes to treat their clinical condition. It has been long recognised that the MTL plays a critical role for declarative memory functions. MTL neurons {{have been shown to}} change their tuning during associative learning tasks. However, it is still not clear whether their involvement is confined to the task execution or goes beyond it. To address this issue, we studied the responses of MTL neurons in neurosurgical patients to known concepts (people and places), in conjunction with two different metrics measuring the degree of association between items (one metric based on the patients' evaluations and the other based on web searches). We found that whenever MTL neurons responded to more than one concept, these concepts were typically related, therefore providing evidence for a long-term involvement of MTL neurons in the representation of durable associations, which is essential to declarative memory functions. We also analysed the differences between spiking responses elicited by different stimuli in a single neuron, and how these differences related to the degree of association between stimuli. We found that, in general, MTL neurons exhibit a similar neural activity in response to different stimuli, and that eventual differences in the responses are smaller the more two stimuli are associated to each other. Our results support the idea that a process of <b>unitisation</b> of neural responses occurs in the MTL, and that information about the stimulus identity is not encoded in individual neurons, but rather at the neural assembly level...|$|E

Forty- five students (12 high proficient, 12 semiproficient, 8 medium proficient, 8 medium semiproficient, 5 low proficient) were identified for semistructured individual interviews (Burns, 1994). The interview was informed by the numeration model and, as a consequence, incorporated tasks relating to position and order, to multiplicativity, and to the <b>unitisation</b> and reunitisation of decimal fractions. The interview results revealed that: (a) knowledge of position and order differentiated between high- performing (high proficient, high semiproficient, medium proficient) and low-performing (medium semiproficient, low proficient) students; and (b) availability and accessibility of multiplicativity tasks were the major factors which differentiated performance amongst the high-performing students. As a result of analyses of students' interview responses and the knowledge subcomponents of the decimal-number taxonomy, structural models that represented the cognitions and connections held by the composite performance categories for position/order, multiplicativity, and unitisation/reunitisation were constructed. From a comparison of the structural models, cumulative models that combined findings for each performance category across position/ order, multiplicativity, and unitisation/reunitisation were constructed. The cumulative models represented the two domains involved in decimal-number numeration understanding, namely, whole numbers and fractions, with multiplicativity represented as the structural knowledge that unifies and integrates the structural knowledge of position/order and unitisation/reunitisation. The models were used to draw implications for instruction in decimal numbers and mathematics generally...|$|E
40|$|Jahai, a {{language}} {{belonging to the}} Aslian branch of the Mon-Khmer language family, is spoken {{by a group of}} about 1, 000 hunter-gatherers in the montane rainforests of northern Peninsular Malaysia. Drawing on linguistic data collected in the field, the present dissertation is a study of the grammar of Jahai. The work begins with an introduction to Jahai and its speakers, and subsequent chapters chart the fields of phonology, word formation, nominal word classes, verbal word classes, syntax and a phenomenon referred to here as expressive elaboration. It also includes a word-list. Although largely descriptive in character, the study makes use of suitable theoretical models for the analysis of linguistic features. Typological comparisons are made at times, primarily with other Aslian languages. The phonological section comprises an analysis of phonemes, phonotactic properties, prosody and the phonological behaviour of loanwords. Features of special interest include phonemic vowel nasality and peculiar realisations of word-final nasal consonants. Particular emphasis is placed on the morphological system, which involves intricate and diverse processes of affixation, cliticisation and reduplication. Such processes are analysed within the framework of Prosodic and Template Morphology. A fundamental distinction is made between 'inner' and 'outer' affixation. Verbal morphology is particularly complex, involving a range of derivational categories related to e. g. aspect, Aktionsart and nominalisation. Nominal morphology includes a typologically unusual derivational category of <b>unitisation</b> connected to quantification. The section on syntax analyses tentatively the structure of phrases and clauses and addresses problems of agreement and argument structure. The marginal phenomenon of expressive elaboration deviates in several respects from the ordinary linguistic system and therefore receives separate treatment. In several respects, Jahai conforms to the patterns described for most other languages of the Aslian branch of Mon-Khmer. It also exhibits features hitherto undocumented elsewhere among its relatives. A pervasive feature of the Jahai linguistic system is its readiness to incorporate foreign elements, notably from Malay, the Austronesian majority language of the Malay Peninsula...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} link between human resource development (HRD) interventions and leadership competencies in retail supermarkets in Nigeria and the UK, {{in order to understand}} better how Nigerian supermarkets can improve their leadership competencies by adopting the appropriate HRD interventions learnt from their UK counterparts. The retail supermarket literature in Africa recognises the inability of indigenous retail supermarkets in the continent to outcompete some foreign entrants in their own local market. The thesis, therefore, starts by reviewing the challenges facing these indigenous retail supermarkets in Nigeria, including the specific competencies they may be lacking in comparison with their foreign rivals. With this established in chapter one, the literature review chapters then explore issues of competency creation, including the theories of learning and HRD, since competency is learnt, and the HRD construct is in the forefront of learning in the organisation. The methodology adopted was a constructivist ontological stance coupled with an interpretivist epistemology. 40 qualitative interviews were conducted and the data analysis method adopted was a thematic analysis, particularly the deductive-inductive strategy, while the method of data reduction was via categorisation, <b>unitisation,</b> and detecting a relationship between the empirical and secondary data collected. A set of core competencies were identified, and of these the key difference in the responses (gathered from the two countries) was ‘reflective action taking’, and which was a major competence identified in the responses from the UK supermarkets, especially, Tesco. The thesis, therefore, matched the Tesco options programme (which is a leadership development programme in Tesco) with David Kolb’s experiential learning theory (ELT), and, both correspond neatly well. The thesis, thus, recommends that the ELT should form a fundamental part of our curriculum design, pedagogy and delivery of HRD related modules in schools, but also should be adopted in leadership development programmes, especially, in developing countries. However, by building on the current debate on {{the link between}} HRD, leadership competencies and organisational transformation, this study helps to address the lack of empirical data on HRD in retail supermarkets in developing countries, and suggests ways of improving the competencies of retail supermarket leaders in Nigerian...|$|E
40|$|This master thesis aims {{to enhance}} {{knowledge}} {{on how to}} contribute to an increased sustainability in transport packaging. Five main categories gathering improvement strategy opportunities are developed and illustrated in an Ishikawa diagram. These categories are Process, People, Environment, <b>Unitisation</b> and Material. Empirical data has been collected at company X, both at its headquarters in Gothenburg, and during a one-week visit to its International Distribution Centre in Poland, where interviews to shop floor operators, observations at the packing station, and experiments of different transport packaging alternatives have been carried out. Four initiatives have been undertaken during this study. (1) The layout at the packing area was redesigned to make the material flow more direct and the packing process lean. (2) A guidebook for standardizing operators’ packing methods has been created. (3) Knowledge has been gained from experiments to define best load units across the supply chain. (4) The most valuable packaging materials have been figured {{out to make a}} return flow of packaging material possible. This would reduce raw material consumption as well as reduce the procurement costs of packaging materials. Due to the limitation that only one company has been examined deeply in this master thesis, the result of the study is mainly a good support to the case company focused to work towards sustainable transport packaging. However, the categories of improvement strategy opportunities and the method used in this master thesis can still be a reference to other manufacturing companies in industry. Keywords: transport packaging, sustainability, standardization, process mapping, cyclical packaging.

40|$|M. Comm. Non-profit organisations are {{generally}} self-regulated bodies and usually manage their operations {{in an independent}} manner. This self-management aspect of non-profit organisations can create room for unethical behaviour such as mismanagement and poor performance. As public benefit organisations that primarily function because of donor funding, there is increased pressure from funders and stakeholders for non-profit organisations to provide greater accountability and transparency relating to their work. An information technology solution that can assist non-profit organisations in achieving greater accountability and transparency, as well as improvement in resource utilisation, is the implementation and use of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. However, whether such systems can improve the performance of non-profit organisations and their accountability to stakeholders has not been widely researched. This exploratory study aimed at identifying whether {{the use of an}} ERP system at two non-profit organisations (one based in South Africa and the other in Taiwan) assisted in accountability and transparency in their operations. Furthermore, it was investigated whether the use of an ERP system assists with optimal resource <b>unitisation.</b> Qualitative and quantitative data were collected through the use of an interview guide with six senior managers to assess whether they perceived that the use of an ERP system promoted accountability and transparency. An electronic survey was distributed to a population of 271 users of the system (with 85 completed responses) to gain insight into user perceptions regarding performance improvement through use of an ERP system. Overall, three participants from the South African non-profit organisation suggested that the Maconomy ERP system was beneficial in achieving accountability and transparency goals. They indicated that they system provided them with the ability to monitor and control project activities at the organisation. The three participants from the Taiwanese non-profit organisation indicated that Maconomy ERP system assisted them with accountability and transparency objectives in a limited way. They further suggested that they realise that the system has the potential to assist them further with this requirement as it is still to be rolled out to the entire organisation. Furthermore, most respondents at the South African organisation perceived that the use of the Maconomy ERP system improves operational and personal performance. With regard to the survey, the majority of respondents reported that they understood the system and perceived that it provides value to the organisation. Most respondents at the Taiwanese non-profit organisation perceived that the Maconomy ERP system is beneficial to their organisation; however, most suggested that it does not improve their personal performance. A difference in length of the exposure to the system by respondents could be the cause of the differences in perceptions regarding personal performance. Overall, most of the respondents at both organisations perceived that adopting the Maconomy ERP system to improve performance at their organisation was the correct decision...|$|E
40|$|Multinational {{corporations}} (MNCs) {{are facing}} challenges {{relating to the}} fast changing and dynamic 21 st Century global business environment. These challenges raise critical concerns relating to the strategic role of successive Nigerian governments in creating a favourable macro-environment that enhances industry competitiveness in attracting and sustaining foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows - {{considering the fact that}} since independence in 1960, there has been a significant decline in the Nigerian manufacturing industry output and contribution to the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP). These developments underpin the motivation and rationale for this thesis, which aims to provide better understanding of the dynamic nature of macro-environmental factors influencing the levels of firm competitiveness in the Nigerian manufacturing industry. To achieve this aim, the thesis adopts a pragmatists paradigm underpinned by a mix of Questionnaire Survey involving 84 MNCs operating in the Nigerian manufacturing industry, and a sample size of 925 respondents comprising of 288 Top managers, 460 Staff, and 177 Clients, and Semi-structured interviews of 5 CEOs. The data from the questionnaires and interviews were subjected to factor analysis, multiple regression analysis and content analysis using SPSS and NVivo respectively. The hypotheses tests (H 1, H 1 a-H 1 e) reveal that increased perceived threats from macro-environmental factors significantly reduces the levels of firm competitiveness in the Nigerian manufacturing industry. This is supported by the evidence that, on aggregate, respondents’ perceived levels of threats from politico-legal, economic and financial, sociocultural, technological and ecological environmental factors have a statistically significant negative effect on firms’ competitiveness in the Nigerian manufacturing industry. Using Beta values, politico-legal, economic and financial, and sociocultural factors are identified as the key inhibitors; and in contrast, ecological and technological factors are identifies as the key drivers, of the levels of firm competitiveness. More specifically, on aggregate: (1) Politico-legal factors has statistically significant negative effect, (2) Economic and financial factors has a negative effect but statistically not significant, (3) Sociocultural factors has a negative effect but statistically not significant. In contrast, both (4) Technological factors, and (5) Ecological environmental factors were statistically significant with positive effects, on the levels of firm competitiveness. In addition, the results for both ‘Top Managers’ and ‘Staff’ were statistically significant, while, that for ‘Clients’ were statistically not significant. For the content analysis, a process of pre-coding, <b>unitisation</b> and relationship between themes was adopted. The thematic findings reveals that there is an urgent need for Top managers in manufacturing firms to continuously sense and seize market opportunities, in order to sustain firm competitiveness and to attract increased FDI inflows to the manufacturing industry. The implication of these findings from a decision-making point of view, is that in the short- medium term, strategizing managers need to focus more on the factors which have significant negative or positive effects on firm competitiveness - while in the long-term, they need to evaluate the potential future impact of the factors which at the moment do not {{have a significant effect on}} firm competitiveness. Considering the fact that the holistic framework developed in this study was not tested, future research would test the framework using a mix of quantitative and qualitative data from a case study of 3 - 5 Manufacturing firms in Nigeria...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} effect of normal ageing on the {{strategies}} adopted during episodic memory retrieval, {{using a combination of}} neuropsychological profiling and neuroimaging data measured during performance on a source memory exclusion task. The exclusion task is a type of source memory task where participants distinguish between targets (studied items from one source e. g. female voice), non-targets (studied items from another source e. g. male voice) and new items. Unlike a source memory task where three separate buttons are pressed for each item at test, in the exclusion task one button is pressed for targets and a second for non-target and new items. As this task is more complex than a normal source memory paradigm and also allows participants to perform the task in more than one way, it places high emphasis on the use of strategies to facilitate retrieval and is therefore ideal for investigating strategic retrieval. Previous source memory studies have shown that while older adults are reasonably good at recognising whether items are old or new, they show marked impairments at remembering the source in which items were presented at study. Dual process theories propose that the age-related decline in source memory occurs because recollection becomes impaired with ageing whereas familiarity remains relatively spared. The results reported in this thesis support dual process theory. Experiment 2 a showed that, behaviourally, as expected, the young outperformed the elderly. Event-related potentials (ERPs), recorded while a source memory exclusion test was performed, revealed that both young and older adults showed bilateral frontal and left parietal old/new effects, thought to index familiarity and recollection respectively. Importantly, the magnitude of the left parietal effect was significantly reduced in the older adults. The ERP findings also suggested that dual process theories represent an oversimplification of episodic memory decline with age. In Experiment 1 a, three temporally and topographically distinct late frontal old/new effects were present in the younger adults: a bilateral anterior frontal effect (450 - 900 ms post stimulus), a right prefrontal effect (900 - 1300 ms) and a right frontal effect (1300 - 2000 ms). Significant positive correlations between the magnitude of these effects and performance on neuropsychological tests of executive functioning in Experiment 1 b, revealed that the bilateral anterior frontal effect was related to working memory, strategy use and planning; the right prefrontal effect was related to working memory and planning while the right frontal effect was related to planning. By contrast, the older adults in Experiment 2 a only produced the right frontal effect, which correlated with planning across all three time windows in Experiment 2 c. Post-retrieval monitoring in older adults therefore appeared to be qualitatively different than their younger counterparts. Performance on the neuropsychological tests in Experiment 2 b, revealed that the older adults’ working memory and strategy use was impaired compared to the young, whereas planning was relatively intact, suggesting that age-related differences in post retrieval processing may be due to reduced executive functioning in older adults. Identifying distinct late frontal effects and demonstrating a relationship between these effects and specific executive functions is a novel finding. The presence of a left parietal target greater than non-target difference in the young adults from Experiment 1 a and 2 a was interpreted as the young reducing recollection of irrelevant non-target information. The modulation did not differ in magnitude for targets and non-targets in the elderly adults from Experiment 2 a, suggesting they were less able to reduce activation of goal irrelevant non-target information. The results in the young adults from Experiment 1 a also highlight the importance of considering the context of source information on the processes engaged at retrieval. The bilateral frontal effect was significant for the retrieval of the intrinsic context (source information inherent to the studied item), but not the extrinsic context (source information not inherent to the studied item). This finding was interpreted within a <b>unitisation</b> framework, where the intrinsic context became unitised with the item and enhanced familiarity based remembering. The findings also highlight that in order to fully understand post retrieval processing in both young and old adults, focus should move away from examining quantitative differences in the right frontal effect over long time periods and instead identify qualitatively distinct late frontal effects that may reflect the engagement of various executive functions over time...|$|E
