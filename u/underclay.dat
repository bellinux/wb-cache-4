40|$|Paleoenvironmental {{analysis}} has, thus far, been {{restricted to}} areas where diagenetic and metamorphic influences have been minimal, since modifications resulting from elevated temperatures and pressures can homogenize and overprint environmental signatures. However, results from {{an analysis of}} geochemistry and bulk and clay mineralogy in the Pennsylvanian-age, Buck Mountain <b>underclay</b> and the Lykens Valley <b>underclay,</b> Anthracite region, Northeastern Pennsylvania, suggest that the metamorphic overprint did not completely obliterate the original mineralogical composition, thus allowing paleoenvironmental interpretation. The Buck Mountain <b>underclay</b> is less than 2 meters thick; yet, within the bed, the vertical distribution of feldspars such as albite, of clay minerals [...] chlorite, kaolinite and illite [...] and the metamorphic mineral pyrophyllite, differ considerably. The Lykens Valley <b>underclay</b> occurs approximately 140 meters down section and is 0. 5 meters thick. Geochemical, petrographic and mineralogical analyses, indicate that the Buck Mountain <b>underclay</b> formed during a successional transition from flood plain lake to peat-accumulating swamp and that the Lykens Valley <b>underclay</b> is a well-formed, upland soil profile. ^ The Lykens Valley paleosol profile shows evidence of rooting at depth and is geologically the oldest example of an Ultisol yet identified and provides evidence that an active and complex, forest-type, ecosystem occupied tropical uplands {{at a time when}} coal formation dominated the adjacent lowland environments. The formation of this soil during the Lower Pennsylvanian demonstrates that plant communities had complex rooting systems that were capable of collecting nutrients and surviving in a base-poor and well-drained environment at a much earlier time than was previously thought. Within the upper portion of the paleosol profile, base cations are depleted. However, potassium is enriched. This potassium enrichment coincides with organic enrichment. This research presents evidence for the role of organic matter in the illitization of kaolinite and proposes that this enrichment is the reflection of the biological process of nutrient uptake and sequestration in plant tissues. Thus, illite in the Lykens Valley paleosol is a fossil reflection of Paleozoic nutrient uptake. ...|$|E

Mineralogical trends observed in the <b>underclay</b> with increasing depth below the coal include: (1) a decrease inthe expandability of mixed-layer illite/smectite (I/S); (2) an increase in the amount of ordered US with respect to randomly interstratified US; (3) an increase in the amount of discrete illite with respect to expandable clays; and (4) an increase in chlorite and calcite. Ordered I/S is the dominant mixed-layer clay where calcite is present, but randomly interstratified USdominates where calcite is absent. The pH of the <b>underclay</b> also increases with depth. These trends are consistent with an origin by acid leaching of a preexisting mineral assemblage that included illite, chlorite, and calcite.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{stability}} of coal pillars under realistic conditions of varying weak floor thickness with and {{without the use of}} paste backfill. Weak floor strata underlying coal seams are common in the Illinois Basin. They consist mainly of <b>underclay,</b> which is a gray, argillaceous rock that usually occurs immediately beneath beds of coal. <b>Underclay</b> thickness may vary from less than a foot to twenty feet at different locations in the basin (Grim and Allen, 1938). Locally, <b>underclay</b> thickness may vary gradationally over a distance of two pillars. Even though weak floor thickness is not consistent (Gadde, 2009), most research to date has focused on parametric studies with a fixed <b>underclay</b> thickness and formulated coal pillar designs {{on the basis of the}} maximum <b>underclay</b> thickness measured in the field. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate more realistic field conditions and quantify the influence of a gradated weak floor thickness using additional parametric studies. This research is primarily numerical modeling incorporating various constitutive models and using some calibration. Therefore, the two dimensional plane strain finite difference model in FLAC 3 D is employed to carry out parametric studies on gradated weak floor conditions. <b>Underclay</b> exhibits Mohr Coulomb elastic plastic behavior; hence, the Mohr Coulomb constitutive model is used for the behavior of overburden, coal, and floor. Well-calibrated numerical models can assist in understanding load and failure processes provided that coal, overburden, and weak floor are modeled with sufficient realism. The theoretical approach considers a friction angle of 0 ° to calculate the load bearing capacity of the weak floor for design of pillars with long-term stability, even if the weak floor has a non-zero friction angle. The stiffness of the weak floor increases with an increase in friction angle (Gadde, 2009; Kostecki and Spearing, 2015). As stiffness increases, a point can be reached where floor bearing capacity exceeds coal pillar strength and coal pillar strength becomes the governing factor. For this scenario, the Mohr Coulomb strain softening model is more realistic in estimating loads carried by coal pillars in the post-failure stage. The three-dimensional Mohr Coulomb strain softening model in FLAC 3 D is employed to study qualitatively the floor response in strain softening coal behavior conditions. Maintaining stable coal pillar responses has been a challenge for the coal mining industry due to attempts to increase the primary extraction ratio. Presently, the best available solution seems to be backfilling when considering short-term pillar stability (i. e., less than the long-term factor of safety) with increased extraction ratio. There are various types of mine backfill that have benefits to the mining industry depending on the application, but paste backfill produced from total mill tailings containing no free water is the best option for post-mining ground control in room-and-pillar mines as it prevents weakening of the floor and will not contaminate the ground water. The influence of paste backfill on floor bearing capacity and coal pillar response is studied with numerical modeling using the same constitutive models already identified. Finally, an economic analysis is carried out to look at cost implications of a proposed system with backfill...|$|E

The coal-bearing sequence is underlain by greenish, bioturbated sandstone deposited in open marine water.

The sediments contain marine dinoflagellates and palynomorphs ofan inland flora. Most of the sediment accumulated in tidal channels. Each coal is underlain by rooted strata, usually an <b>underclay.</b> Palynomorphs in the lignite suggest the peat accumulated in low-lying swamps dominated by tupelo trees. These swamps lay along the landward margin of a tidal channel complex. The channel complex probably extended 10 to 30 kin inland from the main coastline.

40|$|Abstract—The S ile Region {{contains}} discontinuous, cyclic, thin coal {{beds and}} industrial clay deposits that were accumulated in lacustrine basins which received extensive volcanoclastic sediments due to transport of highly weathered calc-alkaline volcanic rocks. The Sülüklu ̈ area {{has the largest}} kaolin deposit in this region. Cyclic kaolinization depended {{on the degree of}} leaching of Si and alkalis in cyclic swamp environments and, therefore, kaolinite contents vary in each discontinuous lens-shaped clay bed and <b>underclay</b> within the basin. The kaolins comprise disordered kaolinite, illite, smectite, gibbsite, quartz, pyrite, anatase, K-feldspar and goethite. Depth-related changes in the distribution of clay minerals, associated with coal beds, are indicative of organic acid-mineral reactions. Kaolinite crystallization initiated at the edges of sericitic mica sheets in the form of composite kaolinite stacks. The small size (< 1 mm), morphology and poor crystallinity of kaolinite crystals suggest that kaolinization post dated transportation. Primary or secondary origins of particles can be determined from the stacking sequences of kaolinite particles using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images. Kaolinite stacks always contain a small amount of illite, but smectite is only present in the middle and upper levels.

40|$|Abstract [...] Samples of underclays {{corresponding}} tonine different coal beds of the Maria Luisa {{coal seam}} in the Aller valley (Asturias, Spain) were collected {{to determine whether}} their mineralogy and geochemistry {{could be used for}} correlation. The underclays are dominated by illite, with an average abundance of 46 %, and contain smaller amounts of chlorite, kaolinite (chlorite always more abundant), paragonite, pyro-phyllite, mixed-layer illite/smectite (I/S), and mixed-layer muscovite/paragonite. This mineralogical s-sociation along with the illite "crystallinity " values (mean values of"crystallinity " in air-dried and ethylene glycol-solvated illite are 0. 48 * and 0. 35 * 20, respectively) suggest that the samples have undergone very low-grade metamorphism. No consistent variation in the mineral components with increasing depth below the coal was noted. The presence of chlorite and K-feldspar precludes the development of the underclays by extensive l aching by acid swamp waters and thereby suggests that heir mineral composition was determined largely by provenance. Thirty-seven mineralogical nd geochemical variables were treated by stepwise discriminant analysis. The variables that best served as discriminators between the underclays were: illite + I/S contents of both the whole rock and clay fraction, illite "crystallinity " of the clay fraction in both air-dried and glycolated patterns, pH of the samples, and the elements (in order of atomic number) Na, A 1, K, Ca, Ti, V, Sr, Zr, Nb, Ba.

Paleosol features in the Iatan-Stranger sequence include clay-filled fractures and solution channels (cryptokarst) {{in the top of}} the Iatan Limestone which display some degree of secondary clay orientation along the edges (neostrians). The clay-filled fractures widen upward and grade into the gray to red mottled, non-calcareous, blocky mudstone of the Stranger Shale, which is characterized by an absence of fauna and presence of slickensides, clay coatings on grains (argillans), quartz silt-filled fractures (skeletans), and possible former rooted zones. The mudstone matrix locally displays the sepic plasmic fabrics that are characteristic of soil development. Pedogenesis in this unit resulted from subaerial exposure during retreat of the sea following the transgressive-regressive marine cycle that deposited the Iatan Limestone. Solution-channelling of the top of the Iatan and leaching of clays within its fractures indicates initial exposure to a humid climate with strong meteoric flux. The Stranger paleosol, however, displays features of Entisol, Inceptisol, or Vertisol development in terrestrial deposits under a somewhat drier climate following the partial solution of the upper Iatan. These features include a thick (1 to 2. 4 m) paleosol profile with weak morphologic expression which contains crystalline illitic clays and oxidized iron minerals. Lack of fluvial-alluvial features in the thick, monotonous quartz-silty mudstone sequence of the lower Stranger Shale suggests that fine aeolian detrital influx (desert loess) may have contributed much of the material to this unit. The lack of caliche or weathered clays in the Stranger mudstone indicates the importance of using multiple lines of evidence for recognizing paleosols...|$|E

The Kobiwako group(late Pliocene to Pleistocene) is distributed in the Ueno and Ōmi basins, This group consists of loose sediments of gravel, silt and clay, containing the fossils of fresh-water mollusca and fossil flora.

Also, Iga-clay formation, in rich in commercial clay such as ‘Kibushi clay’and ‘Gairome clay’, which are considered as fresh-water sediments in cuncaves on granitic rocks. The name ‘Kibushi clay’is usually used for a soft and plastic <b>underclay</b> with lignite fragments among sedimentary fireclay. Kurosaki fireclay deposit(about 38 m in depth) can be classified roughly into the following three zones: sandy clay,‘Gairome clay’, and ‘Kibushi clay’. The sandy clay predominate in the deposit, as a whole. Most of the sandy clay,‘Gairome clay’, and‘Kibushi clay’are composed mainly of kaolinite and fine-grained quartz and feldspar. Small amounts of sericite are included in some‘Kibushi clay’. The several white clay layers(about 0. 5 m in thick, each) are intercalated in the upper horizon of‘Kibushi clay’zone. The main constitute minerals of the white clay are smectite(montmorillonite) accompanying with kaolinite and small amount of halloysite. Also, some white clay layers are composed of amorphous substances. These white clay layers were formed diagenetically from volcanic ash, due to their mode of occurrence and mineralogical features. Furthermore, collation of the occurrence and mineralogy of clays in Kurosaki and the other fireclay deposits(Mine, Shimagahara) has been examined. MOst of the clay samples in Mine fireclay deposit are mainly composed of kaolin, quartz and feldspar. These mineral assemblages are similar to that of Kurosaki deposit. Consequently, it is considered that the sedimentary processes and origin of the fireclay deposits in these districts are mostly same conditions. 三重県およびその隣接する近畿県での耐火粘土鉱床は上野市を中心とする伊賀上野盆地周辺地域に多く賦存している。ここでは上野盆地の南端に位置する黒崎陶土鉱山の鉱床の産状および粘土鉱物の性状について述べる。当鉱床は領家黒雲母花崗岩を基盤とし、その凹地を埋めて堆積した伊賀粘土層といわれる花崗岩源の風化砕屑物が粘土化したもので、古琵琶湖層群の最下位の累層にあたる。鉱床は一般に砂質粘土が優位で、蛙目粘土、木節粘土、亜炭、白色粘土などの累層からなり、その最上部を砂礫層が覆っている。これらの砂質・蛙目・木節粘土層の主要鉱物はカオリナイト、石英、長石および少量のセリサイトからなる。鉱床の上位に挾在する数枚の白色粘土層には、スメクタイト（モンモリロナイト）を主として少量のハロイサイトを伴うものと、殆んど非晶質物質からなるものがあり、これらの層は火山灰源と考えている。主な粘土層のカオリナイトは不整が著しくまた結晶度も悪く、瀬戸地域も含めた他地域の同型堆積性粘土鉱床のものと殆んど同じ範囲内にある。また黒埼鉱床と上野盆地島ヶ原地域の峰陶土鉱床の構成鉱物組成、化学成分などを比較してみると、両者に大きな差異はみられない。さらに黒埼鉱山、峰陶土を含む島ヶ原地域での粘土鉱床の生成過程についても考察している...|$|E
