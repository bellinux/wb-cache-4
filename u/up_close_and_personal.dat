The concert was filmed in November 2003 at a sound stage in Nashville, Tennessee, with an audience of 300 people. When conceptualizing the show, Twain desired to make the setting intimate and perform the songs acoustically, so she turned to bluegrass band Alison Krauss and Union Station to perform backup during the concert. It was also modeled after Elvis Presley's '68 Comeback Special, with a similar stage and Twain being costumed by black, leather jumpsuit. <b>Up!</b> <b>Close</b> <b>and</b> <b>Personal</b> premiered on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) on November 25, 2003, and was high in ratings, being watched by over 9 million viewers in the United States.|$|E

[...] Sylvia Chase from The Wichita Eagle said that [...] "seeing Madonna live in an arena and seeing her <b>up,</b> <b>close</b> <b>and</b> <b>personal</b> in the tour cassette is totally different. The energy, the movements, the provocation—all captures you more." [...] Stephen Holden from The New York Times gave it a positive review, stating [...] "filmed with abrupt, swooping camera movements that accentuate the singer's flouncing, slightly ungainly style of dancing, Madonna Live vividly captures the contradictory elements that have made the performer into a cultural icon in spite of a shrill, limited singing voice. In close-up, Madonna's provocative pouts, wiggles and come-hither glances become a more than half-deliberate burlesque of erotic centerfold photography. Both her post-disco music and defiant strut suggest a child's parody of grown-up posturing." ...|$|E
500|$|Krauss was {{apprehensive}} at first, noting drastic {{differences between}} her personal acoustic style {{and that of}} Twain. She stated, [...] "It's so {{different from what we}} do, we didn't know what liberties we were supposed to take. Were we supposed to learn it off the record? Were we supposed to learn the themes?" [...] She found aid in Twain's then-husband and producer Robert John [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange, who told Krauss to perform the songs as if they were her own. While preparing for the show, Krauss said she found the songs very simple to learn because of their catchy melodies that could function in any musical style. While traveling on the Up! Tour, Twain decided to cover of AC/DC's [...] "You Shook Me All Night Long" [...] (1980) for the television special. However, she edited the song's lyrics to void them of the crudeness she was not fond of singing along to as a teenager. Krauss later expressed her opposing views, saying she would have personally kept the original lyrics.

Matt Bjorke of About.com {{reviewed the}} home release of <b>Up!</b> <b>Close</b> <b>and</b> <b>Personal.</b> He had not attended a Shania concert, nor seen the television special, {{and was surprised}} by the singer's stage presence. He believed that the video would make the singer's naysayers realize Shania's vocal talents and ability to entertainment and interact with a crowd. Bjorke concluded, [...] "Up! Live in Chicago is a dynamic DVD experience that is sure to please fans for years to come." [...] Chris Jones of BBC noted the band's differed from most country bands and wanted a more country-influenced sound. However, Jones complimented the singer's incorporation of the audience, naming it her [...] "inimitable style". He added that the video was [...] "far from [...] sterile experience" [...] because of the live setting and crowd ambiance. However, he suspected Shania's [...] "photocopy-perfect" [...] vocal delivery could be attributed to a fair amount of post-production work. [...] "Overall, you know exactly what you're getting with Shania, and for her fans this is bound {{to be a very good}} thing indeed." [...] Bobby Reed of the Chicago Sun Times believed Shania failed to give insight into her identity or personality, noting she never mentioned her relocation to Switzerland or her then-new son, Eja. He complimented the band's strong, yet rote efforts of bringing the dense production to life. However, he claimed Shania's vocal delivery was at times frail. Reed also noted the absence of guest stars, in contrast to her two previous concert specials, and acknowledged that inviting fans onstage gave the concert a country-fair vibe. Mark Guarino of Arlington Heights' Daily Herald believed the concert was evidently tailored for television and that Shania played the proper host. He continued, [...] "As the night wore on, Shania tried different ways, with varying degrees of success, to make the magnitude of such a large event work for the small screen. Her reliance on audience participation was an attempt to humanize things, but it often backfired." ...|$|E
5000|$|Later in 1891, Hugenberg co-founded, {{along with}} Karl Peters, the ultra-nationalist General German League and in 1894 its {{successor}} movement the Pan-German League (Alldeutscher Verband). From 1894 to 1899, Hugenberg {{worked as a}} Prussian civil servant in Posen (modern Poznań, Poland). In 1900 Hugenberg married his second cousin, Gertrud Adickes (1868 - 1960). At {{the same time he}} was also involved in a scheme in the Province of Posen where the Prussian Settlement Commission bought up land from Poles in order to settle ethnic Germans there. In 1899 Hugenberg had called for [...] "annihilation of Polish population". Hugenberg was strongly anti-Polish, and criticized the Prussian government for its [...] "inadequate" [...] Polish policies, favoring a more vigorous policy of Germanization. Hugenberg initially took a role organising agricultural societies before entering the civil service in the Prussian Ministry of Finance in 1903. Again, Hugenberg came into conflict with his superiors who opposed his plans to confiscate all the non-productive estates of the Junkers in order to settle hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germans who would become his idealized farmer-small businessmen and [...] "Germanize" [...] the East. He left the public sector to pursue a career in business and in 1909 he was appointed chairman of the supervisory board of Krupp Steel <b>and</b> built <b>up</b> a <b>close</b> <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> political relationship with Baron Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach. Krupp had been [...] "in search of a man of really superior intelligence" [...] to run the finance department of Krupp AG and found that man in form of Hugenberg with his [...] "extraordinary" [...] intelligence and work-ethic. In 1902, Friedrich Alfred Krupp was outed and committed suicide after the Social Democratic newspaper Vorwarts published love letters he written to his Italian lovers. After his death, the entire firm of Krupp AG was left to his daughter Bertha Krupp. As Krupp AG was one of the world's largest arms-manufactures and the biggest supplier of weapons to the German state, the management of Krupp AG was of some interest to the state, and the misogynistic Emperor Wilhelm II did not believe that a woman was capable of running a business. To solve this perceived problem, the Kaiser had Bertha marry a career diplomat Gustav von Bohlen und Halbach, who was regarded by the Kaiser as a safe man to run Krupp AG. Gustav Krupp as he was renamed by Wilhelm did not know much running a business, and so depended very much on his board to assist him. Hugenberg's role in the management of Krupp AG was thus considerably larger than what his title of director of finance would indicate, and in many ways Hugenberg was the man who effectively ran the Krupp corporation during his ten years at the firm between 1908-18.|$|R
