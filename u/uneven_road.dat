25|$|From 2015 all buses in Scotland {{will have}} to be {{disabled}} accessible to meet the Disability Discrimination Act. This act has caused a great deal of resentment in the bus industry as it will require a large amount of money to be spent modifying or buying new buses that comply with the act, for what is perceived to be little benefit. It also sees a number of otherwise serviceable buses taken off the road and made worthless before the end of their natural life. In Scotland {{there are a number of}} situations where currently no suitable buses are manufactured that could operate due the hilly and <b>uneven</b> <b>road</b> conditions which damage disabled accessible vehicles. The Isle of Arran is one example, where extensive road improvements will be required before disabled accessible buses can be operated extensively on the island.|$|E

Two other people, including the newspaper reporter, followed on bicycles. For short distances the Number 21's speed was close to thirty miles {{an hour on the}} <b>uneven</b> <b>road,</b> and the article said, [...] "there seems no doubt that the machine can reel off forty miles an hour and not exert the engine to its fullest capacity.".|$|E

2500|$|Forced [...] {{vibration}} {{is when a}} time-varying disturbance (load, displacement or velocity) {{is applied}} to a mechanical system. The disturbance can be a periodic and steady-state input, a transient input, or a random input. The periodic input can be a harmonic or a non-harmonic disturbance. Examples {{of these types of}} vibration include a washing machine shaking due to an imbalance, transportation vibration caused by an engine or <b>uneven</b> <b>road,</b> or the vibration of a building during an earthquake. For linear systems, the frequency of the steady-state vibration response resulting from the application of a periodic, harmonic input is equal to the frequency of the applied force or motion, with the response magnitude being dependent on the actual mechanical system.|$|E
2500|$|Figg {{started his}} {{engineering}} career {{in a time}} when computers were just taking off. [...] The first commercial computer wasn’t available until Figg was 21 years old (Keitz 2007). [...] These first computers were very expensive and were used mainly for storage and provided little assistance in calculations. [...] When Figg was in his thirties, computers began to cost less and provide more. [...] The 1960s, and 1970’s, hosted a majority of the pioneering work in technology for structural methods that are used today in concrete bridges. [...] Before the late 1960s, bridges were constructed using deck hinges. [...] This let the structure deform without applying high forces to the girders. [...] However, over time the bridge itself would change shape because of the constant deformations. [...] This would cause problems such as <b>uneven</b> <b>road</b> surfaces and early cracking in the pavement of the roads. [...] Due to improvements in technology, however, this problem was solved using closure joints that made the bridge span continuous (Murillo 2004). [...] This continuity method was made possible largely due to the creation of computer programs that could create detailed material-behavior-prediction models. [...] Using these programs, engineers could run simulations that would help them predict whether or not these new techniques would work. [...] These programs were not available until the early 1970s, because the computer itself still needed improvement.|$|E

50|$|One design consideration, when {{designing}} or {{choosing a}} shock absorber, is where that energy will go. In most shock absorbers, energy {{is converted to}} heat inside the viscous fluid. In hydraulic cylinders, the hydraulic fluid heats up, while in air cylinders, the hot air is usually exhausted to the atmosphere. In other types of shock absorbers, such as electromagnetic types, the dissipated energy can be stored and used later.

25|$|It {{was said}} that Nottingham could not support a tramway company; that there was this, that, and the other special reason why {{it would be all}} moonshine in Nottingham. It was said again that the <b>uneven</b> <b>roads</b> would necessitate the {{employment}} of too many extra horses to make the company pay; but these prognosticators did not know that <b>uneven</b> <b>roads</b> create traffic; that people are ever ready to jump into a car, and even pay a full fare to simply ride {{to the top of a}} hill. Now it happens that these prophets are without honour in their native land. The tramways company is a great success in the town, as we shall see very soon. The first section was opened on September the 18th last year, the running being to and from the Railway Stations, the Trent Bridge , and St. Peter's Church. On that first day 2,277 persons were carried in four inside cars, which were worked by 27 horse, the fare being twopence all the way. But here is something rather good. In the week ending October the 5th (Goose Fair week mind) no fewer than 32,619 persons were carried in five cars; and this result was said by experienced men to be unparalleled in the history of tramways.|$|R

Sometimes she hated Thurston, also, though more often she was sensible of vague regrets, and grew morbid thinking of what might have been. Now she flushed a little as she glanced at the ponies and remembered that they were the price of treachery. The animals were innocent, but she found satisfaction in making them feel the sting of the whip.|$|E

50|$|Ward {{is known}} as being the first {{automobile}} fatality. William Parsons' sons had built a steam-powered car. It was {{thought at the time}} that steam transport would be developed greatly during the near future (this was true for trains, but did not in fact become true for cars due to the development of internal combustion engines). Steam cars were heavy and they did too much damage to the already <b>uneven</b> <b>roads.</b> In 1865 the Red Flag Act imposed a speed limit of four miles per hour for the countryside and two miles per hour in towns. This effectively ended the popularity of motorcars, but some enthusiasts still had one, often homemade, like the Parsons' vehicle.|$|R

They passed ruddy camp-fires, where steam and smoke arose with savory odors, where red-faced men were eating; and they passed other camp-fires, burned out and smoldering. Some tents had dim lights, throwing shadows on the canvas, and others were dark. There were men on the road, all headed for town, gay, noisy and profane.|$|E
60|$|Behind him lay {{the rolling}} moor, cloven by that one ribbonlike stretch of <b>uneven</b> <b>road,</b> broken {{here and there}} with great masses of lichen-covered grey rock, by huge clumps of purple heather, long, {{glittering}} streaks of yellow gorse. The morning was young, and little shrouds of white mist were still hanging around. His own clothes were damp. Little beads of moisture were upon his face. But below, where the Atlantic billows came thundering in upon a rock-strewn coast, the sun, slowly gathering strength, seemed to be rolling aside the feathery grey clouds. Downwards, split with great ravines, the road now sloped abruptly to a little plateau of farmland, on the seaward edge of which stood {{the ruins of a}} grey castle. Dotted here and there about that pastoral strip and on the opposite hillside, were a few white-washed cottages. Beyond these no human habitation, no other sign of life.|$|E

While the Metro was praised for its handling, and offered a significant improvement in ride quality over the Mini, it was criticised for its tendency to pitch and bounce on <b>uneven</b> <b>roads</b> - precisely the characteristics the interconnection was intended to remove.
