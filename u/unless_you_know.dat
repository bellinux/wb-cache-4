500|$|... a John Landis cameo as a {{cafeteria}} dishwasher {{who tries to}} stop Bluto from eating all the food. Landis is dragged across a table and thrown to the floor by Bluto who then says [...] "You don't fuck with the eagles <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> how to fly." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{principle}} {{was modified}} during {{the design of}} X11 to: [...] "Do not add new functionality <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> of some real application that will require it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{wonder at}} you, Foxley,' said his firm-minded acquaintance; 'how can you render {{the young man}} justice <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> who he is?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sometimes I do {{wish you}} could see them; but then <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> could talk with them, and indeed <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> the Melanesian mind and nature, you couldn't {{estimate}} these things rightly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Honora, [...] "and you {{can never}} realize how tired, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> him as I did. When love dies, it turns into hate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's chiefly on {{that account}} {{that we have}} come just now,' said the single gentleman, 'for you will have another visitor presently. We feared you would be anxious <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> from {{ourselves}} what steps we intended to take, and therefore came to you before we stirred in the matter.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly! How can I {{expect you}} to help me <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> what a serious reason there is for keeping Lucilla in the dark." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{project for}} putting watchmen under commissioners, will, I hope, {{be put in}} practice; for it is scarce safe to go by water <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> your man.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{suppose he}} is rather alarming,' said Dick. 'He's {{difficult}} to know, and he's obviously impatient with other people's affectations. There's a certain grimness about him which disturbs you <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> him intimately.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You wouldn't answer Mr. Camperdown's letters, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> That {{alone will}} condemn you. After that there isn't {{a word to}} be said about it;--not a word. Mr. Camperdown is the family lawyer, and when he writes to you letter after letter you take no more notice of him than a--dog!" [...] The old woman was {{certainly}} very powerful. The way in which she pronounced that last word did make Lady Eustace ashamed of herself. [...] "Why didn't you answer his letters, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> were in the wrong? Of course <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> were in the wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{a little}} after that I took her {{slippers}} home from the Charity Ball at the Grand Palaver. Archie Jones took her home herself in his car, but I took her slippers. She'd forgotten them. I thought that a pretty good sign, wasn't it? You wouldn't let a chap carry round your slippers <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> him pretty well, would you, Miss Philippa?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, ha!" [...] said Sir Raffle. [...] "You wouldn't be here <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> where a {{good thing}} is to be picked up. But I must be off. I'm on the Rocky Mountain Canal Company Directory. I'm not above taking my two guineas a day. Good-by, my boy. Remember me to old Optimist." [...] And so Sir Raffle passed on, leaving Crosbie still {{standing}} {{at the corner of}} the lane.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit {{down and}} take a glass of wine. We want your advice in this matter, and <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> how much there is at stake, {{you will not be}} able to enter fully into the affair.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see {{you will}} only mix up matters worse than before <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> the truth. Besides, I offered to marry her: upon my soul I did; but she refused. Her {{real name is}} Susanna Conolly: his sister, worse luck." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is the one}} {{road that}} leads out of my kingdom," [...] said Terribus. [...] "The others all begin and end at the castle. So that <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> the secret of this passage you could never escape from Spor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'For {{what are}} these cries raised? <b>Unless</b> indeed <b>you</b> <b>know</b> me, and have some purpose in your brain?' said the stranger, coming close up to him. 'I am no thief.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I never meant,' said Martin, hastily, 'to {{appeal to}} you against your brother. Do not think me so unmanly and unkind. I merely appealed to you to hear my declaration, that I came here for no purpose of reproach--I have not one reproach to vent--but in deep regret. <b>You</b> could not <b>know</b> in what {{bitterness}} of regret, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> how often I have thought of Tom; how long in almost hopeless circumstances, I have {{looked forward to the}} better estimation of his friendship; and how steadfastly I have believed and trusted in him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Netta {{wanted her}} {{share in the}} matter to remain a secret, Mr. Pettigrew; but I told her {{that was out of}} the question, and that it was quite {{necessary}} that you and Colonel Bulstrode should know the precise facts, for that, as a lawyer, you could not take any action or decide upon any course to be pursued <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> the exact circumstances of the case. However, she asked me, as she has given me the whole particulars, to tell the story for her. When I have done she will answer any questions you may like to ask." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, in that case, I {{should say}} {{two or three}} hours. But it's {{impossible}} to tell exactly, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> how lame the fellow was, and how long a call he made," [...] said Frank, who liked to be accurate.|$|E
6000|$|... "Somehow, I didn't cotton to {{him from}} the beginning. 'Well, I've got to get the other side of it,' I says, 'and <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> any patent way of getting over a hill without going up it, I reckon I am.' ...|$|E
60|$|Perry {{has told}} me that they are almost {{identical}} with the fossilized remains of the diplodocus of the outer crust's Jurassic age. I have to take his word for it--and I guess you will, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> more of such matters than I.|$|E
5000|$|The album {{generally}} received positive reviews. PopMatters critic Deanne Sole {{described the}} {{record as a}} [...] "half an hour of wordless Turkish psychedelica chilled to a nice consistency, being neither too heavy nor superficial." [...] Sole also stated that Özkent [...] "blends his Turkish folk influences so perfectly into the modernity of the psyche-jazz-funk {{that you might not}} even notice them <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> what <b>you</b> were listening for." [...] Keith Kawaii of Tiny Mix Tapes, who described the record as [...] "quite a slice of that time and a real artifact," [...] stated that it [...] "endlessly plods along, riding some kind of universal groove that crosses boundaries and borders just to get you moving." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{short time}} after Strickland had taken Imray's bungalow, my {{business}} took me through that Station, and naturally, the Club quarters being full, I quartered myself upon Strickland. It was a desirable bungalow, eight-roomed and heavily thatched against {{any chance of}} leakage from rain. Under the pitch of the roof ran a ceiling-cloth which looked just as neat as a white-washed ceiling. The landlord had repainted it when Strickland took the bungalow. <b>Unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> how Indian bungalows were built you would never have suspected that above the cloth lay the dark three-cornered cavern of the roof, where the beams and {{the underside of the}} thatch harboured all manner of rats, bats, ants, and foul things.|$|R
6000|$|Among Hilary's guests was Charles Bellingham, a {{bachelor}} of pronounced baldness, who said {{he would come to}} meet Hilary's belated Englishman, in quality of bear-leader to his cousin-in-law, old Bromfield Corey, a society veteran of that period when even the swell in Boston must be an intellectual man. He was not only old, but an invalid, and he seldom left town in summer, and liked to go out to dinner whenever he was asked. Bellingham came to the rescue of the national repute in his own fashion. [...] "I can't account for your not locking up your spoons, Hilary, when <b>you</b> invited me, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> where <b>you</b> could steal some more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only {{came into}} town a week since," [...] said the clerk, rather dryly. [...] "When things look like humming these fellows {{generally}} do come along. But {{you want to}} go slow when you deal with a real-estate man, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> all about him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all. How can {{you trust}} a man, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> him?" [...] "And you expect it within the month? You shall go with me to Lord Scoutbush to-morrow, and--and now we will talk of {{something}} more pleasant." [...] And he began again upon the zoophites.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{only came}} {{for a few}} hours," [...] he told her. [...] "But I have good news for you, Juliet, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> already. Mr. Saunders has found out some of your friends. They {{are going to look}} after you properly, and you will not be alone any more." ...|$|E
6000|$|Some {{will tell}} you, {{that if you}} are sorrowful it is a time for self- examination, and for {{thinking}} of your own soul. I answer--In good time, but not yet. Think first of God; for how can <b>you</b> ever <b>know</b> anything rightly about your own soul <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> first <b>know</b> rightly concerning God, in whom your soul lives, and moves, and has its being? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only {{he likes}} to have a nobleman's name in his mouth," [...] said Geraghty. [...] "I think it's the hoighth of bad manners talking about anybody's friends <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> happen to <b>know</b> them yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{story will}} keep till the morning, Beorn," [...] the king said. [...] "It is still five hours to daylight, {{and we may}} as well retire to rest, <b>unless,</b> indeed, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that there are others engaged in the affair in London or {{elsewhere}} who should be arrested before {{the news of the}} night's business reaches them." ...|$|R
60|$|LORD GORING. The {{drawback}} {{of stealing}} a thing, Mrs. Cheveley, {{is that one}} never knows how wonderful the thing that one steals is. You can’t get that bracelet off, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> where the spring is. And I see you don’t know where the spring is. It is rather difficult to find.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Grahame coolly, [...] "there's {{a risk of}} your {{stopping}} {{here for}} some time. It's an awkward place {{to get out of}} <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it well; particularly when it's blowing fresh. The Northers hardly reach so far, but they unsettle the weather, and when the wind's from seaward a strong eddy stream runs through the bight. Perhaps you may have noticed that the glass is falling fast." ...|$|E
60|$|She noted, too, {{how well}} the gown became her eyes, {{bringing}} out all the deeper colour in them. Lucinda had magnificent eyes. Once Romney had written a sonnet to them in which he compared their colour to ripe blueberries. This may not sound poetical to you <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> or remember just what the tints of ripe blueberries are--dusky purple in some lights, clear slate in others, and yet again in others the misty hue of early meadow violets.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I stop at your house, though," [...] I said, half {{ashamed of}} myself for venturing to make conditions, [...] "there's one promise {{you must make}} me--that I sha'n't see Dr. Ivor <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> let me <b>know</b> and get my consent beforehand." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Downing {{had read}} all the Holmes stories with great attention, and had thought many times what an incompetent ass Doctor Watson was; but, {{now that he had}} started to handle his own first case, he was {{compelled}} to admit that there was a good deal to be said in extenuation of Watson's inability to unravel tangles. It certainly was uncommonly hard, he thought, as he paced the cricket field after leaving Sergeant Collard, to detect anybody, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> who had really done the crime. As he brooded over the case in hand, his sympathy for Doctor Watson increased with every minute, and he began to feel a certain resentment against Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It was all very well for Sir Arthur to be so shrewd and infallible about tracing a mystery to its source, but he knew perfectly well who had done the thing before he started! ...|$|R
5000|$|The show shares stylistic {{similarities}} with Barry's previous series, Bat Masterson, {{in which}} he had played the debonair lawman of the Old West. During the opening credits, as the title flashed onscreen, a woman's voice was heard seductively pronouncing the words [...] "It's Burke's Law!" [...] The title also reflected Burke's habit of dispensing wisdom to his underlings in a professorial manner, e.g.: [...] "Never ask a question <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> already <b>know</b> the answer. Burke's Law." ...|$|R
