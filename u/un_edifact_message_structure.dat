40|$|Abstract] With the {{development}} of applications of XML and the publication of XML schema recommendation by W 3 C, XML+XMLschema-based EDIFACT is becoming a good solution to the electronic commerce applications. Now a lot of large-scale enterprises {{want to make the}} traditional electronic commerce systems migrated to XML schema-based EDIFACT. At the same time many small and medium-scale enterprises want to implement electronic commerce systems with XML schema-based EDIFACT. The design and implementation of <b>EDIFACT</b> <b>message</b> <b>structures</b> based on XML schema is the most important work and the base of applying XML +XML schema-based EDIFACT to electronic commerce systems and implementations of new electronic commerce systems. In this paper we present a method of design and implementation of <b>EDIFACT</b> <b>message</b> <b>structures</b> based on XML schema and illustrate it with examples.

40|$|EDI is {{expected}} to be the dominant form of business communication between organisations moving to the Electronic Commerce era of 2000. The emergence of world-wide EDI standards (like EDIFACT) is a key driver towards this direction. However, the design of new <b>EDIFACT</b> <b>messages</b> is a tedious and complicated task, due to the strict restrictions imposed by the standard. This paper reports on the development of an <b>EDIFACT</b> <b>message</b> generator, i. e. a tool which automatically designs new messages according to input data flows.

30|$|The {{use of the}} Internet {{for trade}} {{facilitation}} became the catalyst {{that led to the}} replacement of EDI in the medium term. An important facilitating role was played by the rapid rise of the XML (eXtensible Markup Language) standard as a means to encode semantic structures pertinent to a domain in a form, which is both machine-readable (well formed) and human-readable (marked up with meaningful tags). XML has become today the most important data interchange format for e-business. An XML document can be displayed by software (for example, by a standard Internet browser) {{but it can also be}} processed by domain-specific applications in the same way as <b>EDIFACT</b> <b>messages.</b> There are now conversion tools such as the XML-Edifact 12 which offer an open path for migration between XML and UN/EDIFACT, turning the complex <b>EDIFACT</b> <b>messages</b> into a human-readable format.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Traditional {{standards}} for Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), such as EDIFACT and ANSI X 12, have been employed in Business-to-Business (B 2 B) e-commerce for decades. Due to their wide industry coverage and long-standing establishment, they will presumably {{continue to play}} an important role for some time. EDI systems are typically not “process-aware”, i. e., messages are standardized but processes simply “emerge”. However, to improve performance and to enhance the control, it is important to understand and analyze the “real ” processes supported by these systems. In the case study presented in this paper we uncover the inter-organizational business processes of an automotive supplier company by analyzing the <b>EDIFACT</b> <b>messages</b> that it receives from its business partners. We start by transforming a set of observed messages to an event log, which requires that the individual messages are correlated to process instances. Thereby, we make use of the specific <b>structure</b> of <b>EDIFACT</b> <b>messages.</b> Then we apply process mining techniques to uncover the inter-organizational business processes.

UN/EDIFACT accounts for over 90% of all electronic data interchange (EDI) messages exchanged globally. UN/EDIFACT messages are used by almost all national customs administrations, all major seaports and a large range of companies (including over 100 000 in the retail sector), and throughout international supply chains.

The new language is tentatively named LEC (Language for Electronic Commerce). 1 The problem 1. 1 Why a new language?

Examples include electronic funds transfers, purchase orders, invoices, and various kinds of administrative information. EDI users range from corporations to armed forces to museums and libraries.

40|$|Objective of {{this paper}} is to {{elaborate}} the impact of the administrative and regulatory framework and the measures within the TEDIS program (Trade Electronic Data Interchange Systems) on the diffusion of EDI. The diffusion of highly standardized EDI solutions, based on EDIFACT and OSI standards, faces two major obstacles: Firstly, companies hesitate to invest in the development of public goods, while other companies and the state can become free riders. Secondly, the economic rationale of EDI solutions is based on a critical mass of participants. Therefore, the role of the CEC to create incentives for companies to invest in an area where part of the results will be public goods (<b>EDIFACT</b> <b>messages)</b> and to collaborate and cooperate with other companies in setting-up EDI networks will be scrutinized.
