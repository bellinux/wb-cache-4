25|$|Disinfection using UV {{radiation}} {{is commonly used}} in wastewater treatment applications and is finding an increased usage in municipal drinking water treatment. Many bottlers of spring water use <b>UV</b> <b>disinfection</b> equipment to sterilize their water. Solar water disinfection has been researched for cheaply treating contaminated water using natural sunlight. The UV-A irradiation and increased water temperature kill organisms in the water.|$|E
25|$|Wastewater is {{collected}} {{and sent to}} the City of Red Deer wastewater treatment plant which treats the sewage with a combination of grit traps, a primary clarifier, biological nutrient removal bioreactors, secondary clarifiers, and <b>UV</b> <b>disinfection.</b> Solids generated from the treatment process are treated using dissolved air flotation, anaerobic digestion, and biosolids lagoons. Treated effluent is then discharged back into the Red Deer River downstream of the water treatment plant.|$|E

To {{enhance the quality of}} the marine discharge from the Davis WWTP, a number of different, proven technologies have been selected {{to be used in the}} future, such as ozonation, <b>UV</b> <b>disinfection,</b> chlorine, as well as UF, activated carbon filtration and RO.|$|E

25|$|Untreated {{organic matter}} that {{contains}} fecal coliform can {{be harmful to}} the environment. Aerobic decomposition of this material can reduce dissolved oxygen levels if discharged into rivers or waterways. This may reduce the oxygen level enough to kill fish and other aquatic life. Reduction of fecal coliform in wastewater may {{require the use of}} chlorine and other disinfectant chemicals, or <b>UV</b> <b>disinfection</b> treatment. Such materials may kill the fecal coliform and disease bacteria. They also kill bacteria essential to the proper balance of the aquatic environment, endangering the survival of species dependent on those bacteria. So higher levels of fecal coliform require higher levels of chlorine, threatening those aquatic organisms.|$|E
25|$|<b>UV</b> <b>disinfection</b> is most {{effective}} for treating high-clarity, purified reverse osmosis distilled water. Suspended particles are a problem because microorganisms buried within particles are shielded from the UV light and pass through the unit unaffected. However, UV systems can be coupled with a pre-filter to remove those larger organisms that would otherwise pass through the UV system unaffected. The pre-filter also clarifies the water to improve light transmittance and therefore UV dose throughout the entire water column. Another key factor of UV water treatment is the flow rate—if the flow is too high, water will pass through without sufficient UV exposure. If the flow is too low, heat may build up and damage the UV lamp.|$|E
25|$|It used to {{be thought}} that <b>UV</b> <b>disinfection</b> was more {{effective}} for bacteria and viruses, which have more-exposed genetic material, than for larger pathogens that have outer coatings or that form cyst states (e.g., Giardia) that shield their DNA from UV light. However, it was recently discovered that ultraviolet radiation can be somewhat effective for treating the microorganism Cryptosporidium. The findings resulted {{in the use of}} UV radiation as a viable method to treat drinking water. Giardia in turn {{has been shown to be}} very susceptible to UV-C when the tests were based on infectivity rather than excystation. It has been found that protists are able to survive high UV-C doses but are sterilized at low doses.|$|E
2500|$|Germicidal <b>UV</b> for <b>disinfection</b> is most {{typically}} {{generated by}} a mercury-vapor lamp.

25|$|The {{degree of}} {{inactivation}} by ultraviolet radiation {{is directly related}} to the UV dose applied to the water. The dosage, a product of UV light intensity and exposure time, is usually measured in microjoules per square centimeter, or equivalently as microwatt seconds per square centimeter (µW·s/cm2). Dosages for a 90% kill of most bacteria and viruses range from 2,000 to 8,000µW·s/cm2. Larger parasites such as cryptosporidium require a lower dose for inactivation. As a result, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has accepted <b>UV</b> <b>disinfection</b> as a method for drinking water plants to obtain cryptosporidium, giardia or virus inactivation credits. For example, for one-decimal-logarithm reduction of cryptosporidium, a minimum dose of 2,500µW·s/cm2 is required based on the U.S. EPA UV Guidance Manual published in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Ultraviolet (UV) {{light can}} be used instead of chlorine, iodine, or other {{chemicals}}. Because no chemicals are used, the treated water has no adverse effect on organisms that later consume it, as {{may be the case}} with other methods. UV radiation causes damage to the genetic structure of bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens, making them incapable of reproduction. The key disadvantages of <b>UV</b> <b>disinfection</b> are the need for frequent lamp maintenance and replacement and the need for a highly treated effluent to ensure that the target microorganisms are not shielded from the UV radiation (i.e., any solids present in the treated effluent may protect microorganisms from the UV light). In the United Kingdom, UV light is becoming the most common means of disinfection because of the concerns about the impacts of chlorine in chlorinating residual organics in the wastewater and in chlorinating organics in the receiving water. Some sewage treatment systems in Canada and the US also use UV light for their effluent water disinfection.|$|E
25|$|Constructed {{wetlands}} {{are designed}} to remove stormwater pollutants associated with fine to colloidal particles and dissolved contaminants. These shallow, extensively vegetated water bodies use enhanced sedimentation, fine filtration and biological uptake to remove these pollutants. They usually comprise three zones: an inlet zone (sedimentation basin) to remove coarse sediments; a macrophyte zone, a heavily vegetated area to remove fine particulates and uptake of soluble pollutants; and a high flow bypass channel to protect the macrophyte zone. The macrophyte zone generally includes a marsh zone {{as well as an}} open water zone and has an extended depth of 0.25 to 0.5m with specialist plant species and a retention time of 48 to 72 hours. Constructed Wetlands can also provide a flow control function by rising during rainfall and then slowly releasing the stored flows. Constructed wetlands will improve the runoff water quality depending on the wetland processes. The key treatment mechanism of wetlands are physical (trapping suspended solids and adsorbed pollutants), biological and chemical uptake (trapping dissolved pollutants, chemical adsorption of pollutants), and pollutant transformation (more stable sediment fixation, microbial processes, <b>UV</b> <b>disinfection).</b>|$|E
50|$|Processing {{consists}} of three stages of filtration, followed by ozone or <b>UV</b> (ultra-violet) light <b>disinfection</b> to eliminate bacteriological contamination. The equipment cost for a standard LWW system is $3500, and operating costs, excluding labor, are pennies per US gallon treated, excluding labor costs.|$|R
25|$|Sizing of a UV {{system is}} {{affected}} by three variables: flow rate, lamp power, and UV transmittance in the water. Manufacturers typically developed sophisticated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models validated with bioassay testing. This involves testing the <b>UV</b> reactor's <b>disinfection</b> performance with either MS2 or T1 bacteriophages at various flow rates, UV transmittance, and power levels {{in order to develop}} a regression model for system sizing. For example, this is a requirement for all drinking water systems in the United States per the EPA UV Guidance Manual.|$|R
25|$|Ultraviolet light (UV) is very {{effective}} at inactivating cysts, in low turbidity water. <b>UV</b> light's <b>disinfection</b> effectiveness decreases as turbidity increases, {{a result of}} the absorption, scattering, and shadowing caused by the suspended solids. The main disadvantage to the use of UV radiation is that, like ozone treatment, it leaves no residual disinfectant in the water; therefore, it is sometimes necessary to add a residual disinfectant after the primary disinfection process. This is often done through the addition of chloramines, discussed above as a primary disinfectant. When used in this manner, chloramines provide an effective residual disinfectant with very few of the negative effects of chlorination.|$|R

40|$|RATIONALE : Transmission {{is driving}} the global {{tuberculosis}} epidemic, especially in congregate settings. Worldwide, natural ventilation {{is the most common}} means of air disinfection, but it is inherently unreliable and of limited use in cold climates. Upper room germicidal ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> air <b>disinfection</b> with air mixing {{has been shown to be}} highly effective, but improved evidence-based dosing guidelines are needed. OBJECTIVES : To test the efficacy of upper room germicidal air disinfection with air mixing to reduce tuberculosis transmission under real hospital conditions, and to define the application parameters responsible as a basis for proposed new dosing guidelines. METHODS : Over an exposure period of 7 months, 90 guinea pigs breathed only untreated exhaust ward air, and another 90 guinea pigs breathed only air from the same six-bed tuberculosis ward on alternate days when upper room germicidal air disinfection was turned on throughout the ward. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : The tuberculin skin test conversion rates (. 6 mm) of the two chambers were compared. The hazard ratio for guinea pigs in the control chamber converting their skin test to positive was 4. 9 (95 % confidence interval, 2. 8 – 8. 6), with an efficacy of approximately 80 %. CONCLUSIONS : Upper room germicidal <b>UV</b> air <b>disinfection</b> with air mixing was highly effective in reducing tuberculosis transmission under hospital conditions. These data support using either a total fixture output (rather than electrical or UV lamp wattage) of 15 – 20 mW/m 3 total room volume, or an average whole-room UV irradiance (fluence rate) of 5 – 7 mW/cm 2, calculated by a lighting computer-assisted design program modified for UV use.

2500|$|Ultraviolet {{disinfection}} {{of water}} is a purely physical, chemical-free process. Even parasites such as cryptosporidia or giardia, which are extremely resistant to chemical disinfectants, are efficiently reduced.

2500|$|Ponds and Lakes are {{artificial}} {{bodies of}} open water {{that are usually}} created by constructing a dam wall with a weir outlet structure. Similar to constructed wetlands, {{they can be used}} to treat runoff by providing extended detention and allowing sedimentation, absorption of nutrients and <b>UV</b> <b>disinfection</b> to occur. In addition, they provide an aesthetic quality for recreation, wildlife habitat, and valuable storage of water that can potentially be reused for e.g. irrigation. Often, artificial ponds and lakes also form part of a flood detention system. Aquatic vegetation plays an important role for the water quality in artificial lakes and ponds in respect of maintaining and regulating the oxygen and nutrient levels. [...] Due to a water depth greater than 1.5m, emergent macrophytes are usually restricted to the margins but submergent plants may occur in the open water zone. Fringing vegetation can be useful in reducing bank erosion. Ponds are normally not used as stand-alone WSUD measure but are often combined with sediment basins or constructed wetlands as pretreatments.|$|E

Ultraviolet light produced an average microorganism inactivation of 85. 4 % following one minute of UV irradiation. The response became asymptotic at this point. Cell viability, measured by ATP concentration, was not reduced below 10 % until 15 minutes of UV treatment. Ultrasonic treatment resulted in microorganism survivals ranging fram 66. 4 % (60 W/ 1 and 30 minutes of treatment) to 25. 1 % (350 W/ 1 and 30 minutes of treatment).
