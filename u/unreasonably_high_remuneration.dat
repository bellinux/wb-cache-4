40|$|AbstractThe {{social problem}} of <b>unreasonably</b> <b>high</b> {{pharmaceutical}} costs for patients in Chinese hospitals damages {{the interests of}} patients {{and it has a}} highly negative impact on the long-term development of the Chinese health service. We constructed a system dynamics model to address two problems, i. e., the <b>unreasonably</b> <b>high</b> prices of drugs and the high level of pharmaceutical fees relative to the medical costs of patients, and we suggest countermeasures and possible solutions. The program Vensim DSS was used to construct a system dynamics model to represent the problem of high pharmaceutical fees for patients in Chinese hospitals. If hospital and medical staff receive a higher kickback rate, {{they are more likely to}} prescribe unnecessary expensive drugs to make greater profits, which results in unnecessary drug consumption and irrational drug use, eventually leading to <b>unreasonably</b> <b>high</b> pharmaceutical fees. The benefit chain of the main drug suppliers should be cut off. It is necessary to break the link between the profits from pharmaceutical sales and the prescribing behavior of physicians, and hospital incomes, to avoid any conflicts of interest over how medicines are prescribed. Thus, cost-containment measures and a reformed pharmaceutical distribution system are needed to regulate physicians and hospital interaction...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{harmonization}} {{of the base}} remuneration for the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) who were previously paid like national parliamentarians implying large differences between the delegations from the 27 member countries. Based on detailed information on individual MEPs between 2004 and 2011, {{we find that the}} reform, which comes with an exceptional increase of, on average, 200 percent per national delegation, has a positive incentive effect on in-office effort as approximated by engagement in speeches, written declarations and drafted reports. However, a <b>higher</b> <b>remuneration</b> increases absence. With respect to political selection, we find that a <b>higher</b> <b>remuneration</b> increases re-election rates. The composition of the pool of MEPs in terms of (ex-ante) quality approximated with formal education, previous political experience and occupational background is, however, unaffected. If we restrict our attention to freshmen, we find that a <b>higher</b> <b>remuneration</b> is related to a lower fraction of MEPs with previous political experience at the highest national level...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} of whether interest rates should be regulated {{for the good of}} society has been debated by secular and religious authorities for millennia. Restrictions on the highest rate of interest allowed by law (if any) are generally set by the states. In the U. S., whether citizens are protected against <b>unreasonably</b> <b>high</b> interest rates is generally a matter for state legislatures to decide. In this article, the current laws of the 50 states and the District of Columbia are examined with regards to the issue of usury, as well as the challenges posed by federal law for states who wish to protect their citizens against <b>unreasonably</b> <b>high</b> interest rates. Special attention is paid to payday loan providers and the way that these have used loopholes in federal law to effectively undermine state interest cap regulations. Finally, the {{question of}} whether Congressional action is needed is answered...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} {{the efficiency of}} Dutch hospitals using the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method with bootstrapping. In particular, the analysis focuses on accounting for cost inefficiency measures {{on the part of}} hospital corporate governance. We use bootstrap techniques, as introduced by Simar and Wilson (J. Econom. 136 (1) : 31 – 64, 2007), in order to obtain more efficient estimates of the effects of governance on the efficiency. The results show that part of the cost efficiency can be explained with governance. In particular we find that a <b>higher</b> <b>remuneration</b> of the board as well as a <b>higher</b> <b>remuneration</b> of the supervisory board does not implicate better performance...|$|R
