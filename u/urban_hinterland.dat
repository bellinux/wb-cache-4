40|$|Many {{cities in}} {{developing}} economies, particularly in Africa, are experiencing ‘urbanisation without industrialisation’. This paper conceptualises {{this in a}} framework in which a city can produce non-tradable goods and – if it is sufficiently competitive – also internationally tradable goods, potentially subject to increasing returns to scale. A city is unlikely to produce tradables if it faces high <b>urban</b> and <b>hinterland</b> demand for non-tradables, or high costs of urban infrastructure and construction. The paper shows that, if there are increasing returns in tradable production, there may be multiple equilibria. The same initial conditions can support dichotomous outcomes, with cities either in a low-level (non-tradable only) equilibrium, or diversified in both tradable and non-tradable production. We demonstrate the importance of history and of expectations in determining outcomes. Essentially, a city can be built in a manner which {{makes it difficult to}} attract tradable production. This might be a consequence of low (and self-fulfilling expectations) or of history. Predictions of the model are consistent with a number of observed features of African cities. ...|$|R

40|$|Urban {{planning}} {{has traditionally}} {{been involved with the}} management of space, creation of place. It is a profession concerned with coordinating relationships between society and nature to foster development which improves all lives especially those of the poor. As such, planning synthesises the concerns of many different fields. Solid waste management however seems to has not been sufficiently appreciated in terms of its spatial implications. Planning literature does not engage substantially with issues around solid waste management. However, through the many allusions to waste and by investigating solid waste literature spatial issues emerged. Indeed, the literature unveiled two overarching themes: First, urban waste can no longer be hidden from waste generator by exporting it to the hinterland. Following on from this, a decentralisation of waste management facilities is pivotal in achieving the participation and fostering the cooperation necessary to create cyclical urban waste flow. Thus beginning with the premise that solid waste concerns are poorly addressed by planning, this dissertation investigates the reason this has transpired in Cape Town and proposes planning interventions that would begin to engender change. After conducting a spatial analysis of the City, engaging urban professionals in conversation, statistical analyses of waste flows, and reviewing the policy relationship between solid waste and spatial planning analysing, it emerged that the oversight of solid waste in planning is rooted in an uncertainty of how to address solid waste concerns. The utility of people-infrastructure relationships, the way in which urban functions relate and the link between regulatory planning policy have been underestimated in in their capacity to effect waste minimisation. In light of this, policy and spatial interventions are proposed; these aim to harness the potential of people and to increase the functionality of infrastructures. These interventions aspire to dissolve the spirit of deference - planning to SWM; citizens to SWM; <b>urban</b> to <b>hinterland</b> - evident in urban solid waste management. If successful, these interventions should challenge urban perceptions of waste such that waste is no longer the responsibility of 'the other'; through recognition of waste's utility a sense of personal responsibility may develop. So, once planning as a profession 'owns' waste management as a key concern, planning can contribute to changing perceptions...|$|R

The impact that this growth has on food security and urban livelihoods has been dealt with in other sections. In {{this part of the}} bibliography those references are brought together that look at the fringe of the expanding cities. The border between urban and rural areas used to be considered as a clear-cut line in the landscape; clear-cut both in the physical and organisational sense. However, increasingly it is recognised that rural and urban features tend to coexist within cities and beyond their limits. The interface between urban and rural domains, or the periurban area, as it is more often called, is under continuous change, driven by the expanding urban areas and the (still) strong linkages with the rural <b>hinterland.</b> <b>Urban</b> population growth has now overtaken migration in terms of influx of persons in the periurban area.

40|$|For {{some time}} now, {{the field of}} urban studies has been {{attempting}} to figure the urban whilst cognisant {{of the fact that}} the city exists as a highly problematic category of analysis. In this virtual special issue, we draw together some examples of what we call urban concepts under stress; concepts which appear to be reaching the limits of their capacity to render knowable a world characterised by the death of the city and the ascent of multi-scalar de-territorialisations and re-territorialisations. We organise the papers selected for inclusion into three bundles dealing respectively with complex <b>urban</b> systems, the <b>hinterland</b> problematic and governing cities in the age of flows. The phenomenon of urban concepts under stress stems from the existence of a gap between existing cartographies, visualisations and lexicons of the urban and 21 st century spatial conditions and territorialities. Given that this disarticulation will surely increase as this century unfolds, a pressing question presents itself: what is to be done with the field of urban studies after the age of the city? In this introduction, we argue that there exist at least six ways of responding to the present conceptual difficulties, each implying a different future for urban studies. We place under particular scrutiny voices which argue that nothing less than a scholarly tabula rasa will suffice. Our conclusion is that the phenomenon of concepts under stress provides an opportunity to think afresh about what to do with the field of urban studies and that it is premature to foreclose discussion about possible futures at this point. city; complex systems; flows; hinterland; planetary urbanisation; urban; urban studie...|$|R

While essentially a concept originating in science, I have found it useful as a means to comprehend the environmental history of cities. Just as living things require the inputs mentioned above, so do cities. That is, cities cannot exist without those inputs—urbanites require clean air, water, food, fuel, and construction goods to subsist while urban industries need materials for production purposes. These materials may initially come from the area of the urban site itself, but increasingly over time they are derived from the <b>urban</b> <b>hinterland</b> or even farther.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of scale economies, {{technological}} growth and industrial structure in creating spatial variation in manufacturing labour and Total Factor (TFP) productivity in Britain. Separate estimates of a translog specification are presented for British manufacturing firms located in defined {{areas of the country}} over the period 1994 - 1998. The results show that TFP change due to scale economies and technological growth has been of much less important in influencing the output growth of manufacturing firms than input growth or industrial structure. Regarding the components of TFP, technological growth has been the dominant force at play. The analysis of average labour productivity identifies shifts to other factors of production and industrial structure as being the main determinants of change, scale economies appear to have had a marginal role. The results identify spatial patterns indicating that more favourable locational effects arise for firms in areas adjacent to large urban centres, rather than for those located within cities, on the extreme periphery of the <b>urban</b> <b>hinterland,</b> or in rural areas and smaller towns. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} urban {{education}} has {{its origins in}} the nexus of urbanization, industrialization and compulsory state education in North America and Europe over a century ago. Yet its key theme – educational equality and universal provision – is relevant in other places, spaces, political economies and cultures where the "urban" has quite different histories, shapes and locations. The city {{is a work in}} progress in the Asia Pacific. The modern city tended to be located along the supply lines of empire (Innis, 1951). In the Asia Pacific, the region’s major centers were established in relation to coastlines or rivers, with the lines of kinship, capital, migration and cultural exchange, language and information flowing along communication/transportation links. Issues of centre/periphery, urban/hinterland, mainstream/minority, indigeneity/diaspora have been framed by the forces of colonialism and empire, by ongoing population movement and cultural contact, and resultant linguistic, religious and cultural heterogeneity, and, of course, by distinctive constraints of geography, space and place. Cities in Southeast Asia, for example, historically arose as colonial administrative centres, rather than manufacturing and resource sites as in the West (Ooi, 2004). In China and India, what counts as the new economic hinterland may be regional centres larger than major North American cities. In the South Pacific context that Puamau and Teasdale (Chapter 14) document, larger island villages of tens of thousands have become sites for classical urban education issues. There schools face new youth identities, generational challenges to tradition, the supplanting of traditional and subsistence economies by systems dependent on tourism and overseas aid, and new conditions of risk for families' and individuals' health and welfare.

Conventionally, BMA imbeds the entire Ilfov county (which surrounds it and form together the Bucharest-Ilfov region (NUTS 2)) as well as localities from other four counties of the South - Muntenia region (also NUTS 2). As Bucharest-Ilfov region appears as an enclave within South-Muntenia region, in a broader view it is considered that BMA influences all seven surrounding counties belonging to the South-Muntenia region. This region as a whole (apart from the localities of the four counties {{that are to be}} incorporated in the metropolitan area) plus Bucharest MA are viewed as the Bucharest metropolitan region, in other words the South-Muntenia region is the BMA external hinterland. In technical terms, the metropolitan area is a zone of direct city impact in which the relationships are strong and permanent (functional <b>urban</b> area, internal <b>hinterland</b> zone) whereas the metropolitan region is a zone in which the relationships are weaker, but the area is under the core city influence (macroregion, external hinterland zone). One of the main debates around BMA and metropolitan region refers to the effects of the BMA on its external hinterland, South-Muntenia region, by far less developed: are they / will they be spread or rather backwash effects?

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the problem of state {{formation}} on the island of Sri Lanka {{during the second half of}} the first millennium B. C. Conventional wisdom on the peopling of the Island and the emergence of complex social formations were shaped by the chronicle episodes that allude to a migration. These episodes suggest that emigration waves stemming from the core regions of north India played a key role in the development of new socio- political formations on the Island. Contrary to this stand, I propose that initial state formation on the island of Sri Lanka was an endogenous development stimulated by a sudden surge in a long-distance cross-cultural exchange in South Asia. A surge in demand for exotics in the emerging states in the Gangetic core region intensified long- distance trade interactions within and beyond the subcontinent penetrating core influence into the tribal interaction spheres operated away from the core areas of north India. Megalithic or Pandukal cultural complex of southern regions of peninsular India and Sri Lanka was one such tribal sphere operated away from the direct influence of the early states of north. However, from around the beginning of 400 B. C. (along with the rise of mahajanapada polities in the north), northern Indian trade networks began to steadily penetrate into the southern tribal sphere. This trend instigated a major socio-political dislocation leading to a massive structural reorganization process in the dominant tribal areas of the south. The inevitable out come of the above process was the formation of state level societies in the southern regions of the subcontinent. Initial Sri Lankan states thus were part of this secondary urban process. Two successive processes are key to the formation of state level societies in Sri Lanka. First, a surge in long-distance trade instigated drastic changes in the existing socio-political and economic system, leading to the emergence of a new, highly complex political economy that led to the integration of <b>urban</b> production and <b>hinterland</b> resources. Second, strategic intervention to undermine social mechanisms important for the sustenance of traditional tribal social structures and introduction of a new state ideology based on Buddhist religious principles played a vital role in the consolidation and expansion of the initial state. In this process materialization of ideology, i. e. creating monumental symbols and sacred spaces, both in the center and in the hinterland, was a key strategy on the part of the newly emerged state in bringing semi-autonomous hinterland populations under state contro...|$|R
40|$|We {{identify}} and offer new explanations {{of change in}} water management infrastructure in the semi-arid <b>urban</b> <b>hinterland</b> of Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka between ca. 400 BC and AD 1800. Field stratigraphies and micromorphological analyses demonstrate that a complex water storage infrastructure was superimposed over time on intermittently occupied and cultivated naturally wetter areas, with some attempts in drier locations. Our chronological framework, based on optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) measurement, indicates that this infrastructure commenced sometime between 400 and 200 BC, continued after Anuradhapura reached its maximum extent, and largely went into disuse between AD 1100 and 1200. While the water management infrastructure was eventually abandoned, it was succeeded by small-scale subsistence cultivation as the primary activity on the landscape. Our findings have broader resonance with current debates on the timing of introduced ‘cultural packages' together with their social and environmental impacts, production and symbolism in construction activities, persistent stresses and high magnitude disturbances in ‘collapse', {{and the notion of}} post 'collapse' landscapes associated with the management of uncertain but essential resources in semi-arid environments.

At Jebel Qaᶜaqir, the domestic and funerary remains provide an unprecedented assemblage and permit a reassessment of Early Bronze IV society and events {{culminating in the}} collapse of the Early Bronze III urban centers. Historically, pottery studies have focused on chronological issues. After reviewing the history of ceramic analysis in Israel for the past one hundred years, the Jebel Qaᶜaqir collection is presented. Variation in the manufacturing technique and incised patterns are described in detail for the purpose of identifying the work of individual potters. Ethnoarchaeological research of pottery production, especially the Filipino potters of Paradijon, provide the model for this analysis. The nature of the late {{third millennium}} B.

Inferences regarding social organization drawn from mortuary practices, settlement types and organization of labor challenge the idea that an egalitarian society persisted.

Its purpose is to contribute to the knowledge base about HIV/AIDS in the agricultural sector by, firstly, increasing understanding about the HIV/AIDS {{in the context of}} rural communities and, secondly, identifying opportunities to minimize the risk of HIV infection and mitigate the impacts of AIDS in rural communities through market-led agricultural initiatives A fieldwork was conducted to examine three questions: What are the sources of risk of HIV infection and who is at risk? To what extent does AIDS already impact rural communities and their livelihood systems? What might a production and market-oriented project, such as IPMS, offer to address the epidemic? The first section of this working paper is introduction. The second section examines three sources of risk of infection associated with the <b>urban</b> <b>hinterland,</b> the movement of people into and from rural communities, and cultural traditions and practices within rural communities, and concludes with a summary of risk by person. The third section draws on field experience from the PLWs (Pilot Learning Woreda) to demonstrate the potential effect of market-led agricultural growth on hastening the spread of HIV by examining six principal commodity value chains, namely cereals, oilseeds, spices, vegetables, coffee and livestock. The extent to which AIDS has already impacted the rural communities in the 10 PLWs is examined in section four, and sources of vulnerability to future impacts of AIDS are identified. The final section summarizes the main implications of the disease for IPMS and discusses a range of opportunities for reducing the risk of HIV infection and mitigating the impacts of AIDS by improving agricultural productivity and market linkages. They are illustrated with examples of innovative approaches that have been developed, field-tested and implemented by IPMS in several woredas, often in partnership with other organizations.

40|$|Cities are {{becoming}} {{home to a}} growing proportion of Africa’s children. In Tanzania, already one in four lives in an urban centre – and many more will in coming years. Within the short span of a generation, {{more than one-third of}} Tanzania’s children will be raised in a city or town. Growing up urban can offer these children the chance for a brighter future, or the grim conditions in which so many are now living in the sprawling cities of the continent. Increasingly urban Tanzania is more urbanised than it perceives itself to be. Urban Tanzanians feel emotionally rooted in their villages of origin, rather than in the cities and towns where they live. Despite this perception, conditions that are typical of urban areas are more widespread across Tanzania than official figures disclose. Extensive, heavily populated areas are often counted as ‘rural’ simply because they are not officially classified as ‘urban’. Nestled in one of the world’s fastest urbanising region, Tanzania itself is urbanising fast. Nearly half of its urban population is already, and will continue to be, made up of children younger than 18 years. As urbanisation rapidly transforms Tanzania’s physical, social and economic landscape, attention must be paid to the conditions in which new generations of Tanzanian children will be raised. Far too many are living in overcrowded informal settlements that lack clean water and adequate sanitation. They play in heaps of garbage littered with dangerous and even toxic materials. Their families cannot afford quality food, schools or health care; their health and well-being are constantly at risk from mosquitos and other pests that thrive in unsanitary environments – as well as human predators that prey on those least able to defend themselves, exposing children to violence, abuse and sexual assault that increase their risk of HIV infection. Tanzania’s urban children today are more often exposed to the ugly underbelly of city life than to its potential advantages. Fulfilling the rights and aspirations of these children will be a major challenge; careful and timely preparation is needed to address it adequately. Urban advantage The challenges posed by urban growth continue to receive scant attention from policy makers, due partly to widespread belief in an ‘urban advantage’ – the idea that compared to rural residents, city dwellers are invariably better off. It is true that cities enjoy an edge: high concentration of people, proximity and economies of scale permit cities to become engines of growth. Facilities, services, infrastructure and amenities are more readily available in urban than rural settings. Urban centres offer more avenues for jobs and education, and can provide children with greater opportunities for survival, growth and development. Economic resources and political visibility enhance the scope for investments in critical services and infrastructure that can make service provision less costly and more widely available than in Tanzania’s vast and sparsely populated <b>hinterland.</b> <b>Urban</b> areas are also hubs of technological innovation and social interaction. It is no wonder that children and young people are often attracted to cities, where they can draw from resources that are denied to their rural peers. City promises… and realities But for many urban children, the notion of an unqualified ‘urban advantage’ simply does not hold true. Life in the sprawling, unplanned informal settlements of most Tanzanian cities does not match the promise that urban life is supposed to fulfil. The misconception according to which urban dwellers must invariably be better off than rural people stems partly from the tendency to equate availability of services with access to them. But in most cities adequate facilities and quality services are distributed unequally across the urban space, concentrated in affluent areas that tend to attract the most qualified teachers, health workers and other service providers. Meanwhile, the less well-endowed schools and health facilities are located in the poorer parts of a city – the unplanned settlements where up to 80 per cent of urban residents live, most of whom cannot afford to pay fees and other costs for services. The truth is that the ‘urban advantage’ is not shared by all city dwellers. Only a limited few can afford services and amenities that would be unthinkable in a rural setting; the majority not only experience levels of deprivation not unlike those affecting rural children, but a host of social, physical and environmental ills that are specific to an urban context – contaminated water and polluted air, traffic congestion and noise, cramped living conditions in substandard shelters built along riverbanks, on steep slopes or dumping grounds, untreated waste washing away into waterways, lack of safe places for children to gather and play, among other troubling signs of urban malaise. Narrowing gaps Official statistics that compare overall conditions in rural and urban areas tend to mask the actual living conditions of poor urban dwellers. Even so, they indicate that the vaunted urban edge is eroding with the passage of time. For many dimensions of child wellbeing, Tanzania’s rural areas are catching up with cities, where the provision of social services and infrastructure has not kept pace with the growing demand generated by rapid urban growth. For instance: Availability of basic services, expected to be higher in urban centres than remote rural areas, has been declining. Consequently, thetraditional performance gap across the rural/urban divide has narrowed for many indicators in education, health, nutrition, water and sanitation. In some cases rural areas now outperform urban centres. As urban performance stagnates and even declines, it is likely that poor, under-serviced communities are being hit hardest. Although aggregate figures for urban and rural areas prevent detailed analysis of intra-urban disparities, evidence from low-income urban communities – on access to basic services and on health and education outcomes – suggests that poor urban children may often be faring worse than rural peers. Hidden poverty Despite these trends, national policy and programme frameworks continue to mostly target rural poverty, perceived as the nation’s core development challenge. Urban poverty, growing alongside urban affluence, remains mainly unnoticed and, therefore, unaddressed. By depicting rural and urban averages that obscure the disparities so prevalent in cities and towns, official statistics largely miss out on the conditions of the urban poor and their children. Moreover, standard measures of poverty typically underestimate its true extent in urban settings, where families have to incur high costs to afford not only food, but also housing, schooling, health, transport and other necessities. In a monetised urban economy, all necessities have to be purchased with cash, a rare commodity when jobs are irregular and poorly paid. Hidden in official estimates and tucked away in peripheral urban fringes, poor children thus run the risk of remaining invisible in development policy and investments. Gathering and analysing sub-municipal data must be a priority for planners, service providers and communities; local-area data can help to reveal the actual conditions in which poor children live, as well as the inequalities that exist side by side within the confines of a city. An urban future Urban growth is projected to continue in coming decades, and could even accelerate. If the current predicament facing Tanzania’s urban centres is not addressed now, conditions will likely deteriorate. As density increases and unplanned settlements become more congested, investments in facilities, services and infrastructure are likely to become costlier, both financially and socially. Unless it is leveraged properly, the potential advantage that cities can offer could turn instead into a disadvantage. Already Dar es Salaam {{has one of the highest}} proportions of urban residents living in unplanned settlements in all of sub-Saharan Africa. If present trends continue unabated, Tanzania could then find itself facing a daunting scenario: not only are today’s urban children exposed to one of the most hazardous environments imaginable, but climate change is poised to further increase their vulnerability. Clearly the future need not pose a threat. It is ultimately up to the current generation of Tanzanians to ensure that their children will get the best, while avoiding the worst that cities have to offer. Urban governance Urban centres must seek ways to exploit their edge – or watch it disappear. The difference will lie in how access to resources is managed in Tanzania’s towns and cities. A competent, accountable and equitable system of local governance can make that difference. Good local governance can help overcome the disparities that bar access by the urban poor to resources, services and infrastructure: secure land tenure and decent housing, safe water and sanitation, quality education, adequate health care and nutrition, affordable transport. Good local governance can make the difference between a city friendly to children and one that is indifferent to their needs and rights. Municipal governments have the advantage of being close to their constituents; they could make the most of this situation by forming alliances with civil society groups, the media, private sector, community organisations and others, with the aim of improving the conditions in which poor urban families live. Accountable local authorities, proactive communities and children are key actors in a governance process seeking to create an urban environment fit for children. Citizenship and participation Children and adolescents have a right to express their opinions in both defining their problems and providing solutions. This is a right enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Today, Tanzania’s children and adolescents already take part in local governance processes. Some are active in Children’s Municipal Councils, School Barazas and other grassroots institutions. But the majority are rarely consulted – at home, at school or in their communities. Listening to children’s voices can inform local decision-makers about the world in which they live and how they see it, thereby offering a more nuanced understanding of “childhood” and how specific social, cultural and economic realities condition children’s lives. Their scale and proximity makes cities and communities the most relevant place for genuine participation by children. Child-friendly cities It is ultimately in Tanzania’s local communities that children’s rights will be realised and global development goals will be met – in the family, the school, the ward, and the city. Cities offer an ideal platform for convergence of development interventions that normally target children independently, in a fragmented manner. Instead, they need to be delivered holistically, which is easier at the level where children live. Children’s horizon is local. If development goals and children’s rights are not implemented locally, they are likely to remain abstract declarations of intent, without practical translation. Creating an environment friendly to children in every town and city of Tanzania is not only a laudable goal, but a sensible choice for municipal authorities around the country. Local authorities, communities, families and children can and must work together to transform today’s often hostile urban settings into child-friendly cities – as cities friendly to children are ones that are friendly to all. ...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{growth is}} {{connected}} to increasing demands of housing and working areas. A {{large proportion of the}} urban growth occurs at the urban fringe and <b>urban</b> <b>hinterland.</b> Urban growth in the form of sprawl can lead to a separation between workplace and housing thereby increasing the need of cars to commute. That in turn cause various environmental problems. In order to ameliorate this problem, the idea of the compact city has been presented. However, densification can imply a loss of other important urban quality factors of, such as green spaces. A reduction of urban green structure can lead to degradation of ecosystem services, such as storm water treatment, air quality, recreation and aesthetic. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop tools for enhancing the possibilities for win-win solutions in the development of urban environments. The study considers the function of urban form in sustainable development. The sustainable development concept considered is urban form as a tool for ecological planning. Here form and design are factors in damping of energy needs and water flux in the urban environment. The study sets principles for understanding the in-terconnection between urban form and energy needs, water treatments and travel patterns Thus the investigations show that urban form and design effects solar energy potential, ecologically sound treatment of storm water, and the means of travel. The study also considers the concept of sustainable development as enhancing urban quality of life. This part of the study focuses upon the functions of green space. An investigation was carried out on how and if the characteristics found in Swedish green space fulfil different typologies of green space. These green con-cepts are; sheltered patios, designed gardens, nature, public walks, green hiding-places for children and traffic-safe playing fields. Building upon these conceptions of urban green spaces the results of the research lay out a new order for analysis and designing urban green space. This reorganization of concepts acts as a toolbox for urban planning. These tools are purposed as a means for improved and enhanced dialogue between planners, building entrepreneurs and urban residents. It is suggested that green concepts should be used to create functional and inspiring environments for everyday use...|$|E
