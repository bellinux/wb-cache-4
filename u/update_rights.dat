Kick worked with GOG.com for a timed-exclusive release on their digital distribution website on February 2013, where the game was the most requested {{to be added to the}} catalog. This version, considered by GOG.com to be a [...] "collector's edition", incorporates fan-created updates to the original game to make it work on modern systems prepared by an anonymous user named [...] "Le Corbeau". In addition, the updates allow user-made modifications to be applied more seamlessly. [...] The release also contains additional material such as the game's soundtrack, maps of the Von Braun, and the original pitch document for the game. The <b>update</b> <b>rights</b> also allowed a Mac OS X version of System Shock 2 to be subsequently released on June 18, 2013, through GOG.com. The title was later also available on Steam on May 10, 2013. In April 2014 a Linux version was also released.|$|E
40|$|The World Wide Web {{revolutionized}} {{the use of}} forms in everyday private and business life by allowing a move away from paper forms to easily accessible digital forms. Data captured using such HTML forms could be processed using relational databases or other applications that enforce and apply business logic. Lately XForms has been introduced, offering a logical evolution of digital data capture and dissemination using Internet and document technology. This paper introduces two important new ideas. The first one is {{the main focus of}} the paper: a novel type of peer-to-peer web information system where forms are first-class citizens containing extended access rules of very fine granularity which govern read and <b>update</b> <b>rights</b> to data objects associated to the forms. The second idea, which we explore in a preliminary section, forms a powerful motivation for the use of such systems: the automatic and dynamic derivation of workflow processes from the access rules contained in forms. As such, the proposed system leverages current forms and Internet technology to liberate the creation and use of forms and reports, facilitating the capture and dissemination of data, while allowing dynamic management of work flows within organizations. ...|$|E

50|$|This {{weapon was}} a three-barrel 12 in mortar with the mortars mounted in series but off-bore {{from each other}} in order to scatter the {{projectiles}}. The barrels were mounted in a frame that could be rotated through 90 degrees for loading. The projectiles weighed 390 lb with a 207 lb minol charge. On some vessels, the Squid installations were at the stern - the bombs were fired over the length of the ship and dropping into the sea slightly ahead of it. Sink rate was 43.5 ft/s (13.3 m/s) and a clockwork time fuse was used to determine the detonation depth; all three projectiles had to be set to the same depth; this could be continuously <b>updated</b> <b>right</b> up to the moment of launch {{to take into account the}} movements of the target.

A stage is basically an online test consisting a set of questions addressed to the students, often released in a step-by-step format (i.e., breaking a problem into small ones). One stage takes place at each lecture. The time taken by a student {{is a function of}} the accuracy of the answers, with ties between students being resolved by the speed of reply. Following a lecture, final stage standings with times are allocated to each student, and those students ranked in the top positions get a time bonus as an incentive. By computing the times of all stages, it is possible to obtain the overall standings. All this info is <b>updated</b> <b>right</b> after each stage in Blackboard VLE. The timing of the students in the overall standings is employed for continuous assessment purposes (“Participants and Context” Section).|$|R
50|$|The {{protocol}} {{allows the}} cache {{blocks in the}} Sc state to be replaced silently without any bus activity. If a broadcast was made to let other caches know that a Sc block is being replaced, they could test the shared line and move to state E {{if there were no}} other sharers. The advantage of having a block in state E is that if the block is later written, it goes to M state and {{there is no need to}} generate a bus update transaction. So at the cost of broadcasting the replacements of Sc blocks, we are able to avoid bus update transactions. And since broadcasting replacements is not time critical, if a cache is not required to process the replacement right away, there is no downside. On the other hand, if a cache does not process an <b>update</b> <b>right</b> away, it may lead to out-of-order updates. In such cases a three state update protocol, like the Firefly protocol, may have performance advantages.|$|R

As result of the study we present four part taxonomy of the different moblog functions and analyze further more detailed the participative processes of moblogs of each category.

40|$|Saccadic eye {{movements}} cause {{sudden and}} global {{shifts in the}} retinal image. Rather than causing confusion, however, eye movements expand our sense of space and detail. In macaques, a stable representation of space is embodied by neural populations in intraparietal cortex that redistribute activity with each saccade to compensate for eye displacement, but {{little is known about}} equivalent updating mechanisms in humans. We combined noninvasive cortical stimulation with a double-step saccade task to examine the contribution of two human intraparietal areas to transsaccadic spatial <b>updating.</b> <b>Right</b> hemisphere stimulation over the posterior termination of the intraparietal sulcus (IPSp) broadened and shifted the distribution of second-saccade endpoints, but only when the first-saccade was directed into the contralateral hemifield. By interleaving trials with and without cortical stimulation, we show that the shift in endpoints was caused by an enduring effect of stimulation on neural functioning (e. g., modulation of neuronal gain). By varying the onset time of stimulation, we show that the representation of space in IPSp is updated immediately after the first-saccade. In contrast, stimulation of an adjacent IPS site had no such effects on second-saccades. These experiments suggest that stimulation of IPSp distorts an eye position or displacement signal that updates the representation of space at the completion of a saccade. Such sensory-motor integration in IPSp is crucial for the ongoing control of action, and may contribute to visual stability across saccades...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from IEEE via the DOI in this record. Nondominated sorting (NDS), which divides a population into several nondomination levels (NDLs), is a basic step in many evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms. It has been widely studied in a generational evolution model, where the environmental selection is performed after generating a whole population of offspring. However, in a steady-state evolution model, where a population is <b>updated</b> <b>right</b> after the generation of a new candidate, the NDS can be extremely time consuming. This is especially severe {{when the number of}} objectives and population size become large. In this paper, we propose an efficient NDL update method to reduce the cost for maintaining the NDL structure in steady-state EMO. Instead of performing the NDS from scratch, our method only updates the NDLs of a limited number of solutions by extracting the knowledge from the current NDL structure. Notice that our NDL update method is performed twice at each iteration. One is after the reproduction, the other is after the environmental selection. Extensive experiments fully demonstrate that, comparing to the other five state-of-the-art NDS methods, our proposed method avoids a significant amount of unnecessary comparisons, not only in the synthetic data sets, but also in some real optimization scenarios. Last but not least, we find that our proposed method is also useful for the generational evolution model...|$|R
