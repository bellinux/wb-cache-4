It can be found exposed in a limited region, encompassing the flank of the Hoyt Station basalt, colored light yellow in the diagram at right; it also peeks out closer to the volcano twice.|$|E
25|$|By 2003, {{two-thirds of}} the city's {{streetcar}} tracks were in poor condition as the older track was poorly built using <b>unwelded</b> rail attached to untreated wooden ties lying on loose gravel. The result was street trackage falling apart quickly requiring digging up everything after 10–15 years. Thus, the TTC started to rebuild tracks using a different technique. With the new technique, concrete is poured over compacted gravel, and the ties are placed in another bed of concrete, which is topped by more concrete to embed rail clips and rubber-encased rails. The resulting rail is more stable and quieter with less vibration. The new tracks are expected to last 25 years after which only the top concrete layer needs to be removed in order to replace worn rails.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} on weldline properties of injection moulded {{acrylonitrile butadiene styrene}} (ABS) reinforced with short glass fibres was investigated in tension between 25 and 100 °C. Tensile modulus of both weld and <b>unweld</b> specimens increased linearly with increasing fibre concentration and decreased linearly with increasing temperature. It {{was found that the}} presence of weldline had no significant effect upon tensile modulus and this was reflected by weldline integrity factors in the range 0. 98 to 0. 95. Tensile strength of both weld and <b>unweld</b> tensile specimens increased nonlinearly with increasing fibre concentration {{and in the case of}} weldline specimens showed a maximum at fibre concentration of approximately 10 % v/v. A linear dependence with respect to volume fraction of fibres was found for specimens without weldline for fibre concentrations in the range 0 – 10 % v/v. The weldline integrity factor for tensile strength decreased significantly with increasing fibre concentration and increased with increasing temperature. The effect of temperature on tensile modulus and strength was satisfactorily modelled using the Kitagawa power law relationship. ...|$|R
40|$|Deformation of {{the ground}} surface in {{volcanic}} areas is generally recognized as a reliable indicator of unrest, possibly resulting from the intrusion of fresh magma within the shallow rock layers. The intrusion process is usually represented by a deformation source such as an ellipsoidal pressurized cavity, embedded within a homogeneous and elastic half-space. Similar source models allow inferring the depth, the location and the (incremental) volume of the intrusion, which are very important parameters for volcanic risk implications. However, assuming a homogeneous and elastic rheology and, assigning a priori the shape and the mechanism of the source (within a very restricted “library” of available solutions) may bias considerably the inference of source parameters. In complete generality, any point source deformation, including overpressure sources, may be {{described in terms of}} a suitable moment tensor, while the assumption of an overpressure source strongly restricts the variety of allowable moment tensors. In particular, by assuming a pressurized cavity, we {{rule out the possibility that}} either shear failure may precede magma emplacement (seismically induced intrusion) or may accompany it (mixed tensile and shear mode fracture). Another possibility is that a pre-existent weakness plane may be chosen by the ascending magma (fracture toughness heterogeneity). We perform joint inversion of levelling and EDM data (part of latter are unpublished), collected during the 1982 - 84 unrest at Campi Flegrei caldera: a 43 % misfit reduction is obtained for a general moment source if the elastic heterogeneities computed from seismic tomography are accouted for. The inferred source is at 5. 2 km depth but cannot be interpreted as a simple pressurized cavity. Moreover, if mass conservation is accounted for, magma emplaced within a shallow source must come from a (generally deeper) reservoir, which is usually assumed to be deep enough to be simply neglected. At Campi Flegrei, seismic tomography indicates that the “deep” magma source is rather shallow (at 7 - 8 km depth), so that its presence should be included in any thorough attempt to source modeling. Taking into account a deflating source at 7. 5 km depth (represented either as a horizontal sill or as an isotropic cavity) and an inflating moment source, the fit of both levelling and EDM data improves further (misfit reduction 80 %), but still the best fitting moment source (at 5. 5 km depth) falls outside the range of pressurized ellipsoidal cavities. The shallow moment source may be decomposed in a tensile and a shear dislocation. No clue is obtained that the shear and the tensile mechanisms should be located in different positions. Our favourite interpretation is in terms of a crack opening in mixed tensile and shear mode, as would be provided by fluid magma <b>unwelding</b> pre-stressed solid rock. Although this decomposition of the source is not unique, the proposed solution is physically motivated by the minimum overpressure requirement. An important implication of this new interpretation is that the magma emplaced in the shallow moment source during the 1982 - 84 unrest was not added to already resident magma at the same position...|$|R

Foram produzidas e utilizadas juntas soldadas modificando-se a energia de soldagem nos nÃveis 0, 5, 1, 0 e 2, 0 kJ/mm. Duas regiÃes da junta soldada foram obtidas para estudo: a Zona Fundida (ZF) e a Zona Afetada pelo Calor (ZAC). Uma amostra sem sofrer soldagem foi utilizada como referÃncia. A resistÃncia Ã corrosÃo foi avaliada por meio das tÃcnicas eletroquÃmicas: monitoramento do potencial de circuito aberto, polarizaÃÃo potenciodinÃmica, espectroscopia de impedÃncia eletroquÃmica e da temperatura crÃtica de pite (CPT). Os ensaios eletroquÃmicos mostraram que a ZAC da energia 1, 0 kJ/mm se mostrou mais susceptÃvel a corrosÃo. O ensaio CPT nÃo mostrou diferenÃa significativa nos resultados. A nucleaÃÃo dos pites ocorreu na fase ferrÃtica tanto na regiÃo da ZAC e ZF e nÃo apresentou uma relaÃÃo com as regiÃes onde havia a precipitaÃÃo de fases intermetÃlicas. Os resultados indicaram que a energia de soldagem foi o fator que exerceu maior influÃncia sobre o teor mÃdio de ferrita na regiÃo da raiz das juntas. Houve precipitaÃÃes de nitretos de cromo em todas as energias e de fase sigma na energia de 1, 0 kJ/mm e 2, 0 kJ/mm. Foi observado que as composiÃÃes quÃmicas entre as fases ferrita e austenita sÃo bastante semelhantes, porÃm a fase ferrÃtica apresentou um PREN inferior ao da austenita.

However, the effect of welding thermal cycles can be harmful to the properties of these alloys by modifying ferrite/austenite microstructure and intermetallic phases precipitation. The aim of this work is therefore to evaluate the influence of heat input on corrosion resistance and microstructural transformations of super duplex stainless steel UNS S 32760 in multipass welding process MIG/MAG. The samples were produced and welded joints were prepared by modifying the heat input at levels of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 kJ/mm. Two regions of the welded joint were obtained for study: moltenzone (ZF) and the heat affected zone (ZAC). A sample <b>unwelding</b> was used as reference. The corrosion resistance was evaluated by means of electrochemical techniques: open circuit potentialmonitoring,potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and determination of critical pitting temperature (CPT). The electrochemical tests showed that ZAC energy 1. 0 kJ/mm was more susceptible to corrosion. The CPT test showed {{no significant difference in the}} results., The nucleation of pits occurred in the ferritic phase in both the regions ZAC and ZF and did not show a relationship with the regions where precipitation occurred intermetallic phases. The results indicated that the heat input was the factor that had the greatest influence on the average content of ferrite in the root zone of the joints. There was precipitation of chromium nitrides in all samples and sigmaphase in the samples of 1. 0 kJ/mm and 2. 0 kJ/mm. It was observed that the chemical compositions between the ferrite and austenite phases are fairly similar, but the ferrite phase has presented a pitting resistance equivalente (PREN) lower than the austenite...|$|R

2500|$|More than 100eruptions have {{occurred}} in the past 20million years with a broad range of eruptive styles. These volcanic processes have created a range of different volcanic landforms, including stratovolcanoes, shield volcanoes, lava domes and cinder cones, along with a few isolated examples of rarer volcanic forms such as tuyas. Large persistent volcanoes of the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province can remain dormant for hundreds or thousands of years between eruptions and therefore the greatest risk caused by volcanic activity is not always readily apparent. Volcanics older than 14million years are mainly found in the northern portion of the volcanic province while volcanics ranging from nine to four million years old exist only {{in the middle of the}} volcanic province. At least three types of volcanic zones are present in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, including large persistent lava plateaus like those found at the Mount Edziza volcanic complex, polygenetic volcanoes such as Hoodoo Mountain and monogenetic volcanoes like the basaltic cinder cones found throughout the volcanic province. When Northern Cordilleran volcanoes do erupt, pyroclastic flows, lava flows and landslides can devastate areas [...] away and mudflows of volcanic ash and debris can inundate valleys [...] downstream. Falling ash from explosive eruptions can disrupt human activities hundreds of kilometres downwind, and drifting clouds of fine volcanic ash can cause severe damage to jet aircraft even hundreds of kilometres away. Volcanic deposits in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province include lava flows, welded and <b>unwelded</b> pyroclastic deposits, hydroclastic deposits and other ice-contact volcanic deposits. The variety of different volcanic deposits is partly due to changes in eruption characteristics from mainly subaerial eruptions to broadly subglacial eruptions throughout the history of the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province.|$|E

6000|$|That {{next morning}} brought us the Canadian Pacific Railway as one reads about it. No pen of man could {{do justice to}} the scenery there. The guide-books {{struggle}} desperately with descriptions, adapted for summer reading, of rushing cascades, lichened rocks, waving pines, and snow-capped mountains; but in April these things are not there. The place is locked up--dead as a frozen corpse. The mountain torrent is a boss of palest emerald ice against the dazzle of the snow; the pine-stumps are capped and hooded with gigantic mushrooms of snow; the rocks are overlaid five feet deep; the rocks, the fallen trees, and the lichens together, and the dumb white lips curl up to the track cut {{in the side of the}} mountain, and grin there fanged with gigantic icicles. You may listen in vain when the train stops for the least sign of breath or power among the hills. The snow has smothered the rivers, and the great looping trestles run over what might be a lather of suds in a huge wash-tub. The old snow near by is blackened and smirched with the smoke of locomotives, and its dulness is grateful to aching eyes. But the men who live upon the line have no consideration for these things. At a halting-place in a gigantic gorge walled in by the snows, one of them reels from a tiny saloon into the middle of the track where half-a-dozen dogs are chasing a pig off the metals. He is beautifully and eloquently drunk. He sings, waves his hands, and collapses behind a shunting engine, while four of the loveliest peaks that the Almighty ever moulded look down upon him. The landslide that should have wiped that saloon into kindlings has missed its mark and has struck a few miles down the line. One of the hillsides moved a little in dreaming of the spring and caught a passing freight train. Our cars grind cautiously by, for the wrecking engine has only just come through. The deceased engine is standing on its head in soft earth thirty or forty feet down the slide, and two long cars loaded with shingles are dropped carelessly atop of it. It looks so marvellously like a toy train flung aside by a child, that one cannot realise what it means till a voice cries, 'Any one killed?' The answer comes back, 'No; all jumped'; and you perceive with a sense of personal insult that this slovenliness of the mountain is an affair which may touch your own sacred self. In which case.... But the train is out on a trestle, into a tunnel, and out on a trestle again. It was here that every one began to despair of the line when it was under construction, because there seemed to be no outlet. But a man came, as a man always will, and put a descent thus and a curve in this manner, and a trestle so; and behold, the line went on. It is in this place that we heard the story of the Canadian Pacific Railway told as men tell a many-times-repeated tale, with exaggerations and omissions, but an imposing tale, none the less. In the beginning, when they would federate the Dominion of Canada, it was British Columbia who saw objections to coming in, and the Prime Minister of those days promised it for a bribe, an iron band between tidewater and tidewater that should not break. Then everybody laughed, which seems necessary to the health of most big enterprises, and while they were laughing, things were being done. The Canadian Pacific Railway was given a bit of a line here and a bit of a line there and almost as much land as it wanted, and the laughter was still going on when the last spike was driven between east and west, at the very place where the drunken man sprawled behind the engine, and the iron band ran from tideway to tideway as the Premier said, and people in England said 'How interesting,' and proceeded to talk about the 'bloated Army estimates.' Incidentally, the man who told us--he had nothing to do with the Canadian Pacific Railway--explained how it paid the line to encourage immigration, and told of the arrival at Winnipeg of a train-load of Scotch crofters on a Sunday. They wanted to stop then and there for the Sabbath--they and all the little stock they had brought with them. It was the Winnipeg agent who had to go among them arguing (he was Scotch too, and they could not quite understand it) on the impropriety of dislocating the company's traffic. So their own minister held a service in the station, and the agent gave them a good dinner, cheering them in Gaelic, at which they wept, and they went on to settle at Moosomin, where they lived happily ever afterwards. Of the manager, the head of the line from Montreal to Vancouver, our companion spoke with reverence that was almost awe. That manager lived in a palace at Montreal, but from time to time he would sally forth in his special car and whirl over his 3000 miles at 50 miles an hour. The regulation pace is twenty-two, but he sells his neck with his head. Few drivers cared for the honour of taking him over the road. A mysterious man he was, who 'carried the profile of the line in his head,' and, more than that, knew intimately the possibilities of back country which he had never seen nor travelled over. There is always one such man on every line. You can hear similar tales from drivers on the Great Western in England or Eurasian stationmasters on the big North-Western in India. Then a fellow-traveller spoke, as many others had done, on the possibilities of Canadian union with the United States; and his language was not the language of Mr. Goldwin Smith. It was brutal in places. Summarised it came to a pronounced objection to having anything to do with a land rotten before it was ripe, a land with seven million negroes as yet <b>unwelded</b> into the population, their race-type unevolved, and rather more than crude notions on murder, marriage, and honesty. 'We've picked up their ways of politics,' he said mournfully. 'That comes of living next door to them; but I don't think we're anxious to mix up with their other messes. They say they don't want us. They keep on saying it. There's a nigger on the fence somewhere, or they wouldn't lie about it.' ...|$|E

But מְיֻדָּע is ambiguous in import. It primarily means [...] "known, well-known, acquainted", an [...] "acquaintance" [...] (see Job 19:14; Psalm 55:13; Psalm 88:8, 18). But as [...] "intimate acquaintances", especially in a primitive and comparatively <b>unwelded</b> state of society, are generally found within the circle of kinsfolk, the word may be used, and is here used, in reference to a [...] "kinsman". The Vulgate translates it consanguineus. The translation is interpretatively correct; but the original term is less definite, and hence, in virtue of the ambiguity, there is not absolute redundancy in the appended clause, [...] "of the family or clan of Elimelech." [...] The [...] "next kinsman" [...] of Ruth 2:20, etc. גאל gā'al, is a wholly different word. Some say {{that his father was}} Elimelech's brother.|$|E
5000|$|The Incapillo {{ignimbrite}} is an <b>unwelded</b> ignimbrite {{that covers}} a {{surface area of}} 80.47 km2, extending to a distance of 15 km from the caldera. The ignimbrite appears in an eastward-heading ephemeral river valley and the southern Quebrada del Veladero, possibly also next to the Rio Salado headwaters. Thicknesses range from 250 to 10 m; the ignimbrite is underlain by a lithic-and-ash rich surge deposit with a thickness of 5 cm. The ignimbrite displays banding features away from the caldera and in Quebrada de Veladero football-sized clasts are mixed within fine ash. Rocks from the ignimbrites farther away from their source indicate the ignimbrite probably formed from the mixing of less viscous dacitic magma with rhyolite. The total volume of the ignimbrite is about [...] Ages have been found of 0.52 ± 0.03 and 0.51 ± 0.04mya ago. It is a rhyodacitic to rhyolitic ignimbrite with a high crystal and pumice and low lithic content. The dense rock equivalent volume is about [...] The volume of the Incapillo ignimbrite is {{comparable to that of}} the Katmai ignimbrite. The ignimbrite was probably formed from a low-height fountaining eruption without a high eruption column, forming a base surge first and pyroclastic flows later. The change from lava dome to ignimbrite-forming eruptions may have been triggered by the injection of hotter magmas into the magma chamber or less likely by changes in the tectonic context. During the eruption, a piston-like collapse formed the caldera.|$|E
50|$|More than 100 eruptions have {{occurred}} in the past 20 million years with a broad range of eruptive styles. These volcanic processes have created a range of different volcanic landforms, including stratovolcanoes, shield volcanoes, lava domes and cinder cones, along with a few isolated examples of rarer volcanic forms such as tuyas. Large persistent volcanoes of the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province can remain dormant for hundreds or thousands of years between eruptions and therefore the greatest risk caused by volcanic activity is not always readily apparent. Volcanics older than 14 million years are mainly found in the northern portion of the volcanic province while volcanics ranging from nine to four million years old exist only {{in the middle of the}} volcanic province. At least three types of volcanic zones are present in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, including large persistent lava plateaus like those found at the Mount Edziza volcanic complex, polygenetic volcanoes such as Hoodoo Mountain and monogenetic volcanoes like the basaltic cinder cones found throughout the volcanic province. When Northern Cordilleran volcanoes do erupt, pyroclastic flows, lava flows and landslides can devastate areas 10 km away and mudflows of volcanic ash and debris can inundate valleys 10 km downstream. Falling ash from explosive eruptions can disrupt human activities hundreds of kilometres downwind, and drifting clouds of fine volcanic ash can cause severe damage to jet aircraft even hundreds of kilometres away. Volcanic deposits in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province include lava flows, welded and <b>unwelded</b> pyroclastic deposits, hydroclastic deposits and other ice-contact volcanic deposits. The variety of different volcanic deposits is partly due to changes in eruption characteristics from mainly subaerial eruptions to broadly subglacial eruptions throughout the history of the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province.|$|E
50|$|The tallest {{mountain}} Ruapehu, is an Andesite cone {{that was}} once twice as high but has been eroded. All of the cones are composite stratovolcanoes made up of layers of lava and tephra. They are in the intermediate category meaning they have a moderate amount of silica in the magma. The percentage of silica is the deciding factor in the thickness or viscosity of the lava. This contrasts with ignimbrite which is a gas-rich material ejected from the ground at high speed forming a giant white hot fountain 55 kilometres high. When the ignimbrite falls it flows outwards at high speed (600-900 km/h) and can travel many kilometres even going up and over hills and mountains before it cools, trapping air inside. Especially around Lake Taupo the eroded ignimbrite includes pieces of pumice, a lightweight rock that floats on water. The top, <b>unwelded</b> layer of the ignimbrite sheet is relatively soft and easily eroded by streams and rivers which transport the pumice to the lake. The lower, welded layers of the ignimbrite sheets are more dense, though still porous. These lower compressed layers often show the glint of heated silicon specks. This stone, called Hinuera stone(after the quarry of origin), is used for building cladding. The ring plain around the central volcanoes is formed from numerous lahars or mudflows that occur when either the crater lake water is ejected from Ruapehu or snow is melted, during an eruption. The water runs down the mountain picking up ash, lapilli, blocks and bombs as well as previously eroded rock forming a thick dense mud {{that is capable of}} picking up car sized rocks. An old lahar flow is visible from the approach road to Whakapapa ski field. In December 1953 a sudden lahar at night on Mt Ruapehu knocked out the rail bridge at Tangiwai causing three carriages of the Wellington-Auckland express to plunge into the Whangaehu River killing many passengers.The last major eruption in the area was the last eruption from the Lake Taupo volcanic complex 1800 years ago which ejected lava and especially wind blown tephra over a wide area to the north and north east of the North Island. About 30cubic kilometres of material were released making this the biggest volcanic event in the world in the last 5,000 years.|$|E
5000|$|The highest {{unit of the}} Cerro Tuzgle volcano is the [...] "Platform" [...] unit, {{which covers}} a surface area of 0.5 km2 and is capped off by a well-preserved summit crater. It {{consists}} of well-preserved blocky lava flows with maximum thicknesses of 30 m. These are the youngest stages of Tuzgle volcanism and are well preserved. Radiating away from the central summit of the volcano, another lava flow unit forms the so-called Azufre synthem; these lava flows reach maximum thicknesses of 15 m and are gray to brownish-red with some evidence of hydrothermal alteration. On the northwestern and southern flanks, lava emission from one emission area down steep slopes form the San Antonio synthem (unconformity bounded unit), with lava flows up to 30 m thick. These San Antonio stage lavas have been cut by a 1.25 km long fault scarp trending NNE-SSW {{that may have been}} formed by a mass failure of the Tuzgle edifice, which was then rebuilt by the Azufre stage lavas. On the northern flank is found a volcaniclastic fan with a surface area of 12 km2, a volume of [...] and thicknesses of 30 - 40 m, presumably, considering its geochemical composition, formed by a mass failure of the San Antonio stage edifice. The scarp was probably formed by the same event but was not accompanied by explosive activity or a pyroclastic flow. This flank collapse may have been triggered by magma injection. A structure on the southern side of the volcano may also be a collapse scar, but no deposit is identifiable. A weakness zone running east-west cuts across the Tuzgle edifice, and some volcanic features are aligned along this weakness. A 5 km wide feeder dyke has been modelled and is associated with this weakness zone. The youngest- and best-exposed lava flow of Cerro Tuzgle originated in a group of three depressions bordered by 1 - 2 m scoria ridges. These depressions, presumably eruption fissures, are arranged in en echelon order. This youngest lava flow has a structure between block lava and aa lava. In non-volcanic terms patterned ground is found resulting from pre-glacial processes.Tuzgle is underpinned by a plateau formed by mostly <b>unwelded</b> ignimbrites, while the so-called [...] "Pre-platform", [...] "Platform", [...] "Post-platform" [...] and [...] "Young Flow" [...] units make up the central volcano. The moderately crystal-rich ignimbrite has a volume of [...] and is 80 m thick, and was presumably emitted from a caldera now buried by the Cerro Tuzgle edifice. Circular lava domes (50 m thick at a maximum) are found in the southeastern, eastern and northern sector of the volcano and may have formed along ring dykes associated with the caldera. A high electrical conductivity zone beneath Tuzgle may constitute a magma chamber embedded within porous material containing saline fluids with the bottom at a depth of at least 22 km and the top at a depth of 8 km. Crustal silicic magmas gave rise to ignimbrites from depths of 15 - 18 km. The magma chamber appears to be placed next to a crustal decollement at 20 km. Thermobarometric data also indicate a magma origin depth of 10 - 20 km. Beneath Tuzgle, a high seismic attenuation plume rises from an earthquake cluster at 200 km depth up to the volcano and is probably linked to asthenospheric upwelling.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{fretting}} wear performance of surface wear-resistant Cr 3 C 2 /Ni 3 Al composite deposited onto IC 6 SX alloy by manual argon tungsten-arc welding {{was investigated in}} this study. The {{results showed that the}} welded substrate exhibits a very good performance in comparison to the <b>unwelded</b> substrate at 500 ºC and 800 ºC, with 51. 5 % and 57. 8 % decrease of the fretting sectional area respectively. However, the fretting sectional area of the welded substrate is larger than that of the <b>unwelded</b> substrate at RT indicating poor fretting resistance as the reinforce phases of the welding layer is harder and more harmful to the sample surface. Examination of the fretting surfaces indicated that both the welded and <b>unwelded</b> samples undergo gross slip at RT and 500 ºC, and partial slip at 800 ºC. Coefficient of friction (COF) results were given by the SRV- 4 tester which shows that as the temperature goes up, the COF of samples became lower and more stable. The results showed that the COF of welded substrate is lower than that of the <b>unwelded</b> substrate most of the time...|$|E
