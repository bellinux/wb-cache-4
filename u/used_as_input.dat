5|$|Rhythm game or rhythm {{action is}} a genre of music-themed action video game that {{challenges}} a player's sense of rhythm. Games in the genre typically focus on dance or the simulated performance of musical instruments, and require players to press buttons in a sequence dictated on the screen. Doing so causes the game's protagonist or avatar to dance or to play their instrument correctly, which increases the player's score. Many rhythm games include multiplayer modes in which players compete for the highest score or cooperate as a simulated musical ensemble. While conventional control pads may be <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>input</b> devices, rhythm games often feature novel game controllers that emulate musical instruments. Certain dance-based games require the player to physically dance on a mat, with pressure-sensitive pads acting as the input device.|$|E

Factors affecting the accuracy of numerical predictions include the density and quality of observations <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>input</b> to the forecasts, along with deficiencies in the numerical models themselves.

2500|$|At high {{sequence}} identities, {{the primary}} source of error in homology modeling derives from the choice of the template or templates on which the model is based, while lower identities exhibit serious errors in sequence alignment that inhibit the production of high-quality models.

2500|$|The experimentially {{determined}} restraints can be <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>input</b> for {{the structure}} calculation process. Researchers, using computer {{programs such as}} XPLOR-NIH, [...] CYANA or GeNMR attempt to satisfy {{as many of the}} restraints as possible, in addition to general properties of proteins such as bond lengths and angles. The algorithms convert the restraints and the general protein properties into energy terms, and then try to minimize this energy. The process results in an ensemble of structures that, if the data were sufficient to dictate a certain fold, will converge.|$|E
2500|$|A {{major step}} in the module centric {{analysis}} is to cluster genes into network modules using a network proximity measure. Roughly speaking, a pair of genes has a high proximity if it is closely interconnected. By convention, the maximal proximity between two genes is 1 and the minimum proximity is 0. Typically, WGCNA uses the topological overlap measure (TOM) as proximity. which can also be defined for weighted networks. The TOM combines the adjacency of two genes and the connection strengths these two genes share with other [...] "third party" [...] genes. The TOM is a highly robust measure of network interconnectedness (proximity). This proximity is <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>input</b> of average linkage hierarchical clustering. Modules are defined as branches of the resulting cluster tree using the dynamic branch cutting approach ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{two most}} common and {{large-scale}} sources of error in homology modeling are poor template selection and inaccuracies in target-template sequence alignment. Controlling for these two factors by using a structural alignment, or a sequence alignment produced {{on the basis of}} comparing two solved structures, dramatically reduces the errors in final models; these [...] "gold standard" [...] alignments can be <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>input</b> to current modeling methods to produce quite accurate reproductions of the original experimental structure. Results from the most recent CASP experiment suggest that [...] "consensus" [...] methods collecting the results of multiple fold recognition and multiple alignment searches increase the likelihood of identifying the correct template; similarly, the use of multiple templates in the model-building step may be worse than the use of the single correct template but better than the use of a single suboptimal one. Alignment errors may be minimized by the use of a multiple alignment even if only one template is used, and by the iterative refinement of local regions of low similarity.|$|E
