25|$|After Romania {{signed a}} {{separate}} {{peace with the}} Central Powers, and following the demobilization of summer 1918, Steuerman returned to Iași. Back into civilian life, Rodion was, like George Topîrceanu, one of the combatants whom the war years had rendered even more critical of the Ententist option; from Moldavia, he sent his texts {{to be published in}} Stere's explicitly Germanophile review, Lumina, and, at the same time, began contributing to Scena, the daily owned by conscientious objector A. de Herz. Lumina hosted a second series of his Scrisori, beginning in June 1918. During the same month, Rodion was also a correspondent of the short-lived leftist tribune Umanitatea, launched in Iași by the Bessarabian Germanophile Alexis Nour, and noted for its advocacy of total Jewish emancipation. On July 27, Opinia published Steuerman's eulogistic commentary on the political essays of Stere's follower Dimitrie D. Pătrășcanu; Pătrășcanu's text, grouped <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>headline</b> Vinovații ("The Guilty Ones"), constituted an indictment of both the Entente and the National Liberal Party, Romania's main Ententist group.|$|E

This latter statement was in direct contradiction to the Society's policy of only admitting men who were exclusively homosexual. Gerber was put through three separate trials, before charges against him were finally dismissed because he was arrested without a warrant.|$|E
