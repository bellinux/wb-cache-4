40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the impact of the {{temperature}} on tunable resonators with regard to the frequency shift, the current consumption and the insertion losses in the 30 °C to 150 °C range. Two different technologies have been selected; the first one is a FR 4 technology, where the tunability is performed with a PIN diode, whereas on the second one, the resonators are designed on a silicon substrate with an integrated active element. In each technology, the active component switches from an open-ended to a short-ended resonator. This paper presents three different configurations; one on the FR 4 substrate where the resonant frequency switches from 2. 8 GHz to 1. 45 GHz and two others, on the silicon substrate, where the first resonator is designed in the same frequency range and switches from 2. 96 GHz to 2. 1 GHz whereas the second one is designed at higher frequency (commutes from 7. 3 GHz to 3. 9 GHz). Electromagnetic simulations are compared to the measurements and are presented between 30 °C and 150 °C.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{implications}} of cross-country housing market heterogeneity for a monetary union, also comparing the results with a exible exchange rate and independent monetary policy set-ting. I develop a two-country new Keynesian general equilibrium model with housing and collateral constraints to explore this issue. Results show that in a monetary <b>union,</b> <b>consumption</b> reacts more strongly to monetary policy shocks in countries with high loan-to-value ratios (LTVs), a high pro-portion of borrowers or variable-rate mortgages. As for asymmetric technology shocks, output and house prices increase by more in the country receiving the shock if it can conduct monetary policy independently.

Further-more, I show that when there are asymmetric shocks but identical housing markets, it is bene 8 ̆ 5 cial to form a monetary union with respect to having a exible exchange rate regime.

40|$|The energy <b>consumption</b> {{of network}} <b>elements</b> {{has become a}} big concern due to the {{exponential}} traffic growth and {{the rapid expansion of}} communication infrastructures. To deal with this problem, we propose a new approach called Backbone network Energy Saving based on Traffic engineering (BEST), which reduces the power <b>consumption</b> of network <b>elements</b> at the backbone level through jointly optimising data placement and traffic routing. Based on analysis on traffic characteristics, BEST firstly optimises the placement of data services such that the pairwise traffic demands can be better coordinated with the pairwise network costs, in order to minimise the traffic burden imposed on the network elements. Then, BEST optimises the routing of traffic flows and tries to find the minimum-power network subset that must remain active to fulfill the traffic requirements. Efficient heuristics are given by BEST to find an admissible solution when the problem size is very large. The simulation results illustrate the efficacy and efficiency of BEST in energy conservation on backbone networks...|$|R
40|$|Latvia has set {{a target}} to {{increase}} the gross final consumption of energy from renewable energy sources up to 40 % by 2020. To reach this ambitious objective increasing {{of the amount of}} energy produced from locally available biomass is a priority. In Latvia, as in European <b>Union,</b> <b>consumption</b> of wood and wood waste has increased during the last decade. At the same time, export of pellets and briquettes produced in Latvia is a growing trend, therefore production amounts depend greatly upon export market demand. In the light of a foreseeable increase of the global market of solid biofuels the same trend would be respected in Latvia. Consequently and in the light of an increase in energy consumption this would result in shortages of the substrate biomass for the production of compressed biomass. To cover the growing biomass demand for both domestic consumption and export, potential biomass sources from agricultural and industrial sectors have to be investigated. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} determine the availability of potential herbaceous biomass sources for production of compressed biofuels in Latvia. In order to reach this target the available amounts of herbaceous agricultural and industrial by-products in Latvia have been evaluated and their energy potential has been calculated. In addition, the current use of these materials is described and sustainability aspects of various applications of such materials are discussed. This study intends to provide the necessary background information to select the most suitable and convenient sources (in terms of availability and energy value) for the production of compressed mixed biomass fuels at laboratory conditions and the consecutive determination of quality and physical, mechanical, thermo-chemical and combustion properties of such fuels...|$|R

40|$|In this dissertation, we model three {{different}} security scenarios and propose solution methodologies to address each problem. Chapter 2 presents a large-scale optimization approach for solving a dynamic bi-level network interdiction problem (NIP) in which interdiction activities must be scheduled {{in order to}} minimize the cumulative maximum flow over a finite time horizon. A logic-based decomposition (LBD) approach is proposed that utilizes constraint programming to exploit the scheduling nature of this dynamic NIP. Chapter 3 considers a set of centers to which content (e. g., data or smuggled items), are assigned to ensure availability. An interdictor (e. g., border security officials) attempts to determine which centers (e. g., border 2 ̆ 7 s checkpoints) to interdict {{in order to minimize}} the content availability. We present our efforts to model the problem as an Integer Programming formulation and show that the problem is NP-hard. We propose modeling improvements, which, in conjunction with a genetic algorithm is used to obtain quality solutions to the problem quickly.
