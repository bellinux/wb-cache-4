2500|$|An {{exceptionally}} large Virgin & Child (36 in high) {{known as}} Our Lady of Westminster, sculpted circa 1450 in Nottingham and exported {{from there to}} France, {{can be found in}} the Lady Chapel of Westminster Cathedral, London, whence it was installed after being bought at the Paris Exhibition of 1954. This image still carries numerous traces of its original polychromy, such as the characteristic [...] "daisy pattern" [...] against a dark green ground on the base, red and blue in the garment folds and gilding on the crown and mantle fastenings. This image is very similar stylistically to one found buried in the churchyard of Broughton-in-Craven and may have been from the same workshop.

The patents for the cubes were awarded in 2004, and mass-production began in 2008.

Various sizes of TRAM were defined, from the basic Size 1 TRAM (3.66 in by 1.05 in) <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>Size</b> 8 (3.66 in by 8.75 in).
