5|$|Congregation is {{the third}} studio album by American {{alternative}} rock band The Afghan Whigs, released on January 31, 1992, by Sub Pop. After touring {{for two years in}} support of their 1990 album <b>Up</b> <b>in</b> <b>It,</b> the band received $15,000 advance from Sub Pop to record a follow-up album. It was primarily recorded at Bear Creek Studios in Woodinville and Buzz's Kitchen in Los Angeles during July to August 1991. The band's frontman Greg Dulli produced the album entirely with audio engineer Ross Ian Stein. The album's production and release were hindered by Sub Pop's financial difficulties, which were eventually resolved by the massive commercial success of Nirvana's 1991 album Nevermind.|$|E

500|$|After {{forming in}} 1986 in Cincinnati, The Afghan Whigs—vocalist and rhythm guitarist Greg Dulli, bassist John Curley, lead guitarist Rick McCollum, and drummer Steve Earle—released their 1988 debut album Big Top Halloween on an {{independent}} record label and gained {{the attention of}} Seattle-based label Sub Pop. With their second album <b>Up</b> <b>in</b> <b>It</b> (1990) released on the label, the band toured regularly in the United States {{for two years and}} occasionally in Europe before recording Congregation. Sub Pop gave the band a $15,000 advance to record the album, which Dulli later said was a [...] "then-unheard-of" [...] and [...] "bloated" [...] amount. Along with a collective interest in classic rock, the band members had other individual tastes in music, including McCollum's interest in free jazz, experimental, and Indian music, and Dulli's love of hip hop, soul, and funk, particularly Motown artists and Prince. Their African-American music influences were comically referred to by Congregations cover photo, which depicted a nude black woman sitting on a blanket with a white baby held in her arms.|$|E

500|$|According to critic Martha P. Nochimson, {{the film}} is an {{exploration}} of the place of anonymous breakdowns of social order in personal life. For the most part, questions of justice operate in the background of The Man From London, which foregrounds the perceptions and point of view of an accidental witness to the murder, who, like the viewer, has no connection with anyone involved. The film principally concerns the texture of the world of the protagonist Maloin as he experiences it ﬁrst hand: fog, light, shadow, skin, walls, ﬂoors, windows, sounds. These are much closer to Maloin than any broken laws involving strangers as in the killing at the dock. As distinct from the trope of crime functioning as a break from the boredom of the mundane for the Hitchcockian ordinary man [...] "excitingly" [...] caught <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> the interjection of crime {{in the lives of the}} characters of The Man from London is a phantom occurrence for those burrowed into the center of the mundane details of their lives. In other words, Tarr's ﬁlm suggests the possibility that it is only on an abstract plane that murder committed by and on strangers causes a stir and demands an investigation. In this context, it is fitting that the investigation must be undertaken by a stranger, the man from London, since abstraction entails distancing from an enveloping context. Only the appearance of the man from London, Brown, impels Maloin to struggle with his de facto alienation, as an ordinary man, from moral principle, an alienation linked, counterintuitively, to the absence of desire in his daily grind.|$|E
500|$|During a {{spin-off}} series titled , Gilly and Josh Ashworth head to Manchester. The series {{explored the}} dangers of bringe drinking and {{was funded by the}} Home Office. This was the start of changes implemented to the character that would continue into the main series. During the spin-off he was portrayed having negative experiences with excessive alcohol consumption, of this Quinlan said: [...] "Gilly and Josh had a little fight over Ruby (Nika McGuigan), so the character did change due to all the drink consumed. His mood changed further when he attempted to run after Josh after the scuffle, and fell down a set of stairs in the nightclub, losing some of his teeth. After the incident he couldn't wait to get back home to the village."He then stated that he wanted viewers to learn from his character's scenario and be responsible while drinking, stating: [...] "It will make people think twice about binge drinking and make people aware of the consequences if you do." [...] When the character lost his teeth it made the character's low confidence worsen, Quinlan made comment of this saying: [...] "Gilly's confidence was always low really - self-confidence, self-belief. But having no teeth isn't good to look at - not a good look. It's going to draw attention to him and not do him any favours." [...] To enable continuity the character was scripted a slight speech impediment, behind the scenes Quinlan had a special palette fitted, it was a real one fitted by real life dentists and paid for by the show, it would black the character's front teeth and leave a chipped one at the side. Quinlan also revealed it was quite difficult to speak when wearing it, but praised it as being realistic to have some form of speech impediment having teeth knocked out. Talking of his character's changes and lessons learnt during the special episodes Quinlan said: [...] "I think Gilly's learnt to chill out a little, not to follow the crowd and be a sheep. Everyone was drinking loads, he got caught <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> and he came out {{on the wrong side of}} it. So, I think there is a lesson learned there - Gilly will do his own thing and not drink as much." ...|$|E
500|$|A [...] "big" [...] musical number, [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] begins {{within the}} first fifteen minutes of Tangled during the film's first act when, {{on the eve of}} her eighteenth birthday, Rapunzel finally summons enough courage to ask Gothel for {{permission}} to travel and see the floating lanterns in person. Gothel, whose eternal youth and beauty solely relies on the safety and protection of Rapunzel's magical hair, denies this request by sarcastically reminding her that [...] "mother knows best," [...] warning her ward that [...] "the world is full of wicked people who want to steal her hair's magic," [...] while explaining to her that it's [...] "for her own good," [...] claiming to only want to protect her. At one point during the scene, Gothel actually contradicts herself; Teena Elizabeth of BookMyShow observed, [...] "Gothel has no intentions of letting her go. Though Mother Gothel sings, 'soon, but not yet,' but ironically later says, 'Rapunzel, don't ever ask to leave this tower...again.'" [...] Writing for the Tulsa World, Michael Smith observed that Gothel uses the song [...] "as her lie/rationale for keeping the girl safe (holding her hostage) from those who might steal her for their own hair-inspired profit schemes." [...] Amid Amidi of Cartoon Brew felt that the scene is both funny and scary, citing Gothel's [...] "theatrical gestures" [...] and [...] "claustrophobia-inducing stark black backgrounds" [...] as examples of both. [...] "cementing [...] character's ruthlessness," [...] Gothel ultimately orders Rapunzel to promise never to ask permission to leave the tower again. Moviefone's William Goss cited the musical number as an example of [...] "fear-mongering," [...] which has been defined by Dictionary.com as [...] "a person who creates or spreads alarming news." [...] Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail penned, [...] "Mother Knows Best hilariously convey the fear and guilt that have kept Rapunzel in the tower of her own free will." [...] In her book Marvels & Tales, author Kendra Magnusson observed that, during the [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] musical sequence, [...] "the manipulation of Rapunzel's hair leaves the heroine's body wrenched in one moment and bound <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> the next", depicting that, while Rapunzel's hair can be used to defend herself, [...] "it is simultaneously a liability" [...] and can just as well be used to harm her.|$|E
