5|$|A {{decompression}} {{schedule is}} a specified ascent rate and series of increasingly shallower decompression stops—often for {{increasing amounts of}} time—that a diver performs to outgas inert gases from their body during ascent to the surface {{to reduce the risk}} of decompression sickness. In a decompression dive, the decompression phase may make <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> part of the time spent underwater (in many cases it is longer than the actual time spent at depth).|$|E
5|$|Around 1830, Providence had {{manufacturing}} {{industries in}} metals, machinery, textiles, jewelry, and silverware. Manufacturing has declined since, {{but the city}} {{is still one of}} the largest centers for jewelry and silverware design and manufacturing. Services also make <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> portion of the city's economy, in particular education, healthcare, and finance. Providence also is the site of a sectional center facility (SCF), a regional hub for the U.S. Postal Service. It is the capital of Rhode Island, so the city's economy additionally consists of government services.|$|E

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of Australia's colonial period until after the Second World War, people from the United Kingdom made <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> majority of people coming to Australia, meaning that many people born in Australia can trace their origins to Britain. The colony of New South Wales, founded on 26 January 1788, {{was part of the}} eastern half of Australia claimed by the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1770, and initially settled by Britons through penal transportation. Together with another five largely self-governing Crown Colonies, the federation of Australia was achieved on 1 January 1901.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event {{is assumed to}} be the presence of a large bubble that has taken <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> quantity of dissolved gas from the adjacent tissue in a joint. If the bubble reaches a critical volume, it will have a mechanical effect on the nerve endings causing pain in a tendon. The bubble volume is the critical parameter. This criterion is used to prevent type I pain-only symptoms. The strategy for a safe ascent at this stage is to prevent any gas phase from growing beyond a critical volume.|$|E

In October 1996, Australian Doctor Who fans Damian Shanahan and Ellen Parry discovered a collection in {{the records of the}} National Archives of Australia, provided as evidence by the Commonwealth Film Censorship Board (now the Classification Board). These clips include The Smugglers, episodes 1, 3-4; The Highlanders, episode 1; The Underwater Menace, episodes 2, 4; The Macra Terror, episode 3; Fury From The Deep, episodes 2, 4-5; and The Wheel In Space, episode 4.|$|E

5|$|Lightning is an {{electrical}} discharge {{that occurs in}} a thunderstorm. It {{can be seen in}} the form of a bright streak (or bolt) from the sky. Lightning occurs when {{an electrical}} charge is built up within a cloud, due to static electricity generated by supercooled water droplets colliding with ice crystals near the freezing level. When a large enough charge is built <b>up,</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> discharge will occur and can be seen as lightning.|$|E

From 1954 to 1956 he also was on a political organization advisory group for the Democratic National Committee. The McGoverns' fifth and final child, Mary, was born in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Mining did {{not make}} <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> part of the English medieval economy, but the 12thand 13th centuries saw an {{increased}} demand for metals in the country, thanks to the considerable population growth and building construction, including the great cathedrals and churches. Four metals were mined commercially in England during the period, namely iron, tin, lead and silver; coal was also mined from the 13th century onwards, {{using a variety of}} refining techniques.|$|E

Dharavi, in central Mumbai, has an increasingly large recycling industry, processing recyclable waste from other parts of the city; the district has an estimated 15,000 single-room factories.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} of Dreadnought coincided with increasing {{tension between the}} United Kingdom and Germany. Germany had begun to build a large battlefleet in the 1890s, {{as part of a}} deliberate policy to challenge British naval supremacy. With the conclusion of the Entente Cordiale between the United Kingdom and France in April 1904, it became increasingly clear that the United Kingdom's principal naval enemy would be Germany, which was building <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>large,</b> modern fleet under the 'Tirpitz' laws. This rivalry gave rise to the two largest dreadnought fleets of the pre-war period.|$|E

5|$|The tail of Dimetrodon makes <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> {{portion of}} its total body length and {{includes}} around 50 caudal vertebrae. Tails were missing or incomplete in the first described skeletons of Dimetrodon; the only caudal vertebrae known were the eleven closest to the hip. Since these first few caudal vertebrae narrow rapidly as they progress farther from the hip, many paleontologists {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries thought that Dimetrodon had a very short tail. It was not until 1927 that a largely complete tail of Dimetrodon was described.|$|E
