40|$|The diplomonad genera {{are here}} {{represented}} by three highly diverse species, both free-living (Hexamita inflata), and parasitic (Spironucleus vortens and Giardia intestinalis). All three are moderately aerotolerant flagellates, inhabiting environments where O 2 tensions are low and fluctuating. Many diplomonads are opportunistic pathogens of avian, terrestrial and aquatic animals. Hexamitids inhabit deep waters and sediments of lakes and marine basins, S. vortens commonly infects the <b>intestinal</b> <b>tract</b> of ornamental fish, particularly of cichlids and cyprinids, and G. intestinalis, the <b>upper</b> <b>intestinal</b> <b>tracts</b> of humans {{as well as}} domestic and farm animals. Despite these very different habitats, their known physiological and biochemical characteristics are similar, but they do differ in significant respects as their lifestyles and life cycles demand. They have efficient O 2 scavenging systems, and are highly effective at countering rapid O 2 fluctuations, or clustering away from its source (except for G. intestinalis when attached to the jejunal villi). Their core metabolic pathways (glycolysis using pyrophosphate), incomplete tricarboxylic acid cycle (lacking α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase), and amino acid metabolism (with an alternative energy-generating arginine dihydrolase pathway as a possibility in some cases), largely conform {{to those of other}} protists inhabiting low-O 2 environments. Mitochondrial evolutionary reduction to give hydrogenosomes as seen in Spironucleus spp. has proceeded further to its minimal state in the mitosomes of G. intestinalis. Understanding of essential redox reactions and the maintentence of redox state, especially in the infective encysted stage of G. intestinalis provide increasing possibilities for parasite control. To this aim a plethora of new synthetic chemicals and natural products (especially those from garlic, Allium sativum) show promise as replacements for the highly effective (but potentially toxic to higher organisms) 5 -nitroimidazoles (e. g., metronidazole) in the treatment and/or prevention of dimplomonad infection in humans and animals...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the present}} study was {{minimizing}} the drug release in <b>upper</b> gastro <b>intestinal</b> <b>tract</b> and targeting to colon by using the principles of compression coat. Methods: Compression coated tablets of Ibuprofen were prepared by direct compression method using chitosan (300, 250, 200 & 175 mg). Tablets were evaluated for their physicochemical properties and in vitro drug release studies. In vitro drug release studies were performed with and without rat caecal contents. Results: In the rat caecal contents tablets showed enhanced drug release due to degradation of chitosan coat by colonic colonic enzymes. The in vitro release studies in pH- 6. 8 phosphate buffer containing 2 % w/v of rat caecal contents showed the cumulative percentage release of Ibuprofen after 26 h as 31. 94 % ± 0. 59, 67. 89 % ± 0. 45 and 55. 87 % ± 0. 45 and 82. 52 % ± 0. 92 respectively. Coatthickness and amount of chitosan controls the release rate. Formulations are best fitted with Korsmeyer-Peppas kinetics and mechanism of drug release was non-Fickian. FTIR studies reveals there is no drug-polysaccharide interaction. F 1 formulation was a promising system for drug targeting to colon.

40|$|Crohn's {{disease is}} thought to be an {{autoimmune}} disease, in which the body's immune system attacks the gastrointestinal tract, causing inflammation, it is classified as a type of inflammatory bowel disease. The microspheres carrier for the delivery of the dosage form to the colon is composed of physiological and biodegradable natural polysaccharides and which in turn cause low systemic toxicity, low cytotoxicity and lesser side effects. Most of the polysaccharides used in the processing of pharmaceutical formulations have an approved status of generally accepted as safe which includes accepted food additives for human use or as excipients in various dosage forms. Their natural behaviour to release the entrapped drug moiety at neutral or slightly alkaline pH can enhance the absorption of the drug from the colon which has made them popular as a drug carrier to the colon. Furthermore, they provide the possibility to supply the active drug over a prolonged period of time and the microbial flora present in the colon can initiate the drug release from the delivery system containing polysaccharides. The colonic bacteria are predominantly anaerobic in nature and secrete enzymes that are capable of metabolizing both endogenous and exogenous substrates that escape digestion in the <b>upper</b> gastro <b>intestinal</b> <b>tract.</b> The microspheres when formulated into tablets and coated with pH sensitive enteric coated polymers avoid the problem of degradation of the drug by the gastric pH.

Sprague-Dawley rats received a 20 % to 30 % body surface area burn under anesthesia. Eighteen hours later the common bile duct was cannulated and bile was collected for three hours. Total IgA protein in bile decreased 90 % after thermal injury. The bile volume, the concentration of bile protein, and free secretory component did not change significantly. Although blood flow to the liver 18 hours after thermal injury was not changed, there was a significant reduction in total IgA concentration in the circulation; both monomeric (m-IgA) and polymeric IgA (p-IgA) were decreased. This finding may explain, in part, the reduced concentration of IgA protein in bile. Although not examined in this study, decreased local hepatic synthesis and/or transport of p-IgA across the hepatocyte may also contribute to the reduced IgA levels in bile...|$|E

Phenolic compounds, especially abundant in berries, {{are of interest}} due to their putative anticancer activity. After consumption, however, phenolic compounds are subject to digestive conditions within the gastrointestinal tract that alter their structures and potentially their function. However, the majority of phenolic compounds are not efficiently absorbed in the small intestine and a substantial portion pass into the colon. We characterized berry extracts (raspberries, strawberries, blackcurrants) produced by in vitro-simulated <b>upper</b> <b>intestinal</b> <b>tract</b> digestion and subsequent fecal fermentation.

As such, several roles for TA systems have been proposed, such as phage inhibition, gene regulation and persister cell formation. However, {{the significance of these}} roles is nebulous due to the subtle influence from individual TA systems. For example, a single TA system has only a minor contribution to persister cell formation. Hence, {{there is a lack of}} defining physiological roles for individual TA systems. In this study, phenotype assays were used to determine that the MqsR/MqsA type II TA system of Escherichia coli is important for cell growth and tolerance during stress from the bile salt deoxycholate. Using transcriptomics and purified MqsR, we determined that endoribonuclease toxin MqsR degrades YgiS mRNA, which encodes a periplasmic protein that promotes deoxycholate uptake and reduces tolerance to deoxycholate expo-sure. The importance of reducing YgiS mRNA by MqsR is evidenced by improved growth, reduced cell death and reduced membrane damage when cells without ygiS are stressed with deoxycholate.

40|$|A {{specific}} {{group of}} plant and animal oligosaccharides does not suffer enzymatic digestion in the human <b>upper</b> <b>intestinal</b> <b>tract,</b> achieving the colon microbial ecosystem in intact form. The reason for that is their diverse glycosidic bond structure, in comparison with common energetic polysaccharides as starch or glycogen. In this complex ecosystem, these molecules serve as energy sources, via fermentation, of distinctive beneficial bacterial groups, mainly belonging to the Anaerostipes, Bifidobacterium, Coprococcus, Faecalibacterium, Lactobacillus, Roseburia and other genera. The main catabolic products of these fermentations are short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) as acetate, propionate and butyrate, which appear in high concentrations in the lumen around the colon mucosa. Acetate and propionate are associated to energetic purposes for enterocytes, hepatocytes and other cells. Butyrate is the preferred energy source for colonocytes where it controls their cell cycle; butyrate is able to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor colonocytes. These oligosaccharides that increase beneficial colon bacterial populations and induce SCFA production in this ecosystem are called prebiotics. Here, different sources and chemical structures for prebiotics are described, as well as their modulatory effect on the growth of specific probiotic bacterial groups in the colon, and how their fermentation renders diverse SCFA, with beneficial effects in gut health...|$|E
40|$|Inulin is {{extracted}} from the chicory root. It {{is a set of}} fructans with its monomers linked by means of beta(2 - 1) bonds. This linkage cannot be hydrolysed by either pancreatic or by brush border digestive enzymes in the <b>upper</b> <b>intestinal</b> <b>tract</b> of humans. As such the carbohydrates arrive in the colon, where they are fermented by bifidobacteria and other lactic acid producing bacteria, thus enhancing their relative populations in the gut. Recent research in experimental animal models revealed that inulin has significant anticarcinogenic properties. It acts chemopreventively by reducing the incidence of azoxymethane (AOM) - induced aberrant crypt foci and tumours in the colon. These effects {{may be due to the}} stimulation of bifidobacteria, which themselves have been shown to act as antigenotoxic in the colon and to reduce AOM-induced tumours. Also fermentation products, including the short-chain fatty acid butyrate, could contribute to the protective effects. In this case a mechanism may be the induction of apoptosis of already transformed cells. The experimental evidence from animal studies and from studies elucidating potential mechanisms strongly supports the possibility that inulin will contribute to reducing risks for colon cancer in humans. In order to obtain more insight into this possibility, human dietary intervention studies relating biomarkers of reduced risk to inulin consumption are needed...|$|E
