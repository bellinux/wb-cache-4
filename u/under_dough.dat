40|$|The {{rheological}} properties of dough and gluten {{are important for}} end-use quality of flour {{but there is a}} lack of knowledge of the relationships between fundamental and empirical tests and how they relate to flour composition and gluten quality. Dough and gluten from six breadmaking wheat qualities were subjected to a range of rheological tests. Fundamental (small-deformation) rheological characterizations (dynamic oscillatory shear and creep recovery) were performed on gluten to avoid the nonlinear influence of the starch component, whereas large deformation tests were conducted on both dough and gluten. A number of variables from the various curves were considered and subjected to a principal component analysis (PCA) to get an overview of relationships between the various variables. The first component represented variability in protein quality, associated with elasticity and tenacity in large deformation (large positive loadings for resistance to extension and initial slope of dough and gluten extension curves recorded by the SMS/Kieffer dough and gluten extensibility rig, and the tenacity and strain hardening index of dough measured by the Dobraszczyk/Roberts dough inflation system), the elastic character of the hydrated gluten proteins (large positive loading for elastic modulus [G'], large negative loadings for tan delta and steady state compliance [J(e) (0) ]), the presence of high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) 5 + 10 vs. 2 + 12, and a size distribution of glutenin polymers shifted toward the high-end range. The second principal component was associated with flour protein content. Certain rheological data were influenced by protein content in addition to protein quality (area <b>under</b> <b>dough</b> extension curves and dough inflation curves [W]). The approach made it possible to bridge the gap between fundamental {{rheological properties}}, empirical measurements of physical properties, protein composition, and size distribution. The interpretation of this study gave indications of the molecular basis for differences in breadmaking performance...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{observations}} that aquaporin overexpression increases the freeze tolerance of baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) without negatively affecting the growth or fermentation characteristics held promise {{for the development}} of commercial baker's yeast strains used in frozen dough applications. In this study we found that overexpression of the aquaporin-encoding genes AQY 1 - 1 and AQY 2 - 1 improves the freeze tolerance of industrial strain AT 25, but only in small <b>doughs</b> <b>under</b> laboratory conditions and not in large <b>doughs</b> <b>under</b> industrial conditions. We found that the difference in the freezing rate is apparently responsible for the difference in the results. We tested six different cooling rates and found that at high cooling rates aquaporin overexpression significantly improved the survival of yeast cells, while at low cooling rates there was no significant effect. Differences in the cultivation conditions and in the thawing rate did not influence the freeze tolerance under the conditions tested. Survival after freezing is determined mainly by two factors, cellular dehydration and intracellular ice crystal formation, which depend in an inverse manner on the cooling velocity. In accordance with this so-called two-factor hypothesis of freezing injury, we suggest that water permeability is limiting, and therefore that aquaporin function is advantageous, only under rapid freezing conditions. If this hypothesis is correct, then aquaporin overexpression is not expected to affect the leavening capacity of yeast cells in large, industrial frozen doughs, which do not freeze rapidly. Our results imply that aquaporin-overexpressing strains have less potential for use in frozen doughs than originally thought. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This article {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} {{the synthesis of}} angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) -inhibitory peptides and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) during sourdough fermentation of white wheat, wholemeal wheat, and rye flours. Sourdough lactic acid bacteria, selected previously for proteinase and peptidase activities toward wheat proteins or for the capacity of synthesizing GABA, were used. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was found by fermenting flour <b>under</b> semiliquid conditions (<b>dough</b> yield 330) and, especially, by using wholemeal wheat flour. Fourteen peptides, not previously reported as ACEinhibitory, were identified from the water/salt-soluble extract of wholemeal wheat sourdough (IC 50 0. 19 - 0. 54 mg/mL). The {{major part of the}} identified peptides contained the well-known antihypertensive epitope VAP. The synthesis of GABA increased when the dough yield was decreased to 160.

40|$|The wet {{agglomeration}} {{process is}} implemented {{to improve the}} powders functionalities. The objective of the present work is to investigate a novel reverse wet agglomeration process for reactive powders. This novel process is conducted in two main successive phases during mechanical mixing.

The second stage consists of generating the agglomerates by adding the powder inside the continuous <b>dough</b> <b>under</b> mixing conditions. This agglomeration process is mainly promoted by fragmentation mechanism. We have evaluated {{the impact of the}} process conditions on the electric consumption, agglomeration yield and characteristics of the agglomerates.

40|$|During {{mixing of}} wheat flour doughs, the {{distribution}} of the gluten network changes as a result of continuously applied large deformations. Especially gliadin, changes its distribution in the whole network during mixing. It is possible to fundamentally explain the role of molecular changes in more detail using large amplitude oscillatory measurements (LAOS) in the non-linear region. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} is to understand the effect of mixing on the non-linear fundamental rheological behavior of soft wheat flour dough using LAOS. Dough samples were obtained at 4 different phases of the Farinograph mixing and LAOS tests were done on each of them. LAOS tets give in depth intracycle understanding of rheology. All samples showed strain stiffening S and shear thinning T behavior at large strains previously not known in the cereal rheology community. Increasing mixing time (phase 1 to phase 4) and decreasing frequency resulted in retardation in the break of strain stiffening as strain increases. The strain stiffening behavior started to decrease for the dough samples at the 3 rd and the 4 th phases of mixing. LAOS data enabled us to describe the non-linear rheological changes occurring both in the viscous part largely attributed to the starch matrix and elastic part largely attributed to the gluten network components of the soft wheat flour <b>dough</b> <b>under</b> large deformations.

40|$|The need {{to freeze}} dough is {{increasing}} in bakery production. Frozen dough {{can be stored}} {{for a long time}} without quality change. The capacity of bakery production can be increased in this way, and in the same time, the night shifts can be decreased. Yeast cells can be damaged by freezing process resulting in poor technological quality of dough after defrostation (longer fermentation of dough). The influence of frozen storage time of dough on survival percentage of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was investigated. Dough samples were taken after 1, 7, 14 and 28 days of frozen storage at - 20 °C. After defrosting, at room temperature, samples were taken from the surface and the middle part of <b>dough</b> (<b>under</b> aseptic conditions), and the percentage of living S. cerevisiae cells was determined. During frozen storage of dough, the number of living S. cerevisiae decreased. After 28 days of frozen storage, the percentage of live cells on the surface and inside the dough was 53, 1 % and 54, 95 %, respectively. The addition of k-carragenan to dough increased the percentage of living cells in the middle part of dough up to 64, 63 %. Pure cultures, isolated from survived S. cerevisia cells in frozen dough by agar plates method (Koch's method), were multiplied in optimal liquid medium for yeasts. The content of cytochromes in S. cerevisiae cells was determined by spectrophotometric method. The obtained results showed that the content of cytochromes in survived S. cerevisiae cells was not affected by dough freezing process.

40|$|The {{structure}} of bread crumb {{is an important}} factor in consumer acceptance of bakery products. The noninvasive monitoring of the gas cell formation during the proofing of dough can aid in understanding the mechanisms governing the crumb appearance in the baked product. The development of gas cells during the proofing of dough was monitored in a noninvasive manner using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 4. 7 -T. The acquired MRI time series were analyzed quantitatively using image analysis (IA) techniques. The effects of both kneading temperature and mechanical damage by molding were studied. When additional rheological stress was introduced during molding, a more heterogeneous (coarse) gas cell size distribution was observed, and the dough had a smaller specific volume (as measured by MRI). These characteristics were preserved in the bread crumb structure after baking. The fast-deformation during molding also resulted in an isotropic growth of the dough during proofing, whereas slow-deformation during molding resulted in anisotropic growth. This can be related to a better conservation of stress in the <b>dough</b> <b>under</b> a moderate molding operation. A higher temperature during kneading also resulted in a coarser distribution of the gas cells and a smaller MRI specific dough volume. No effect of kneading temperature on the growth anisotropy could be detected, however. This indicates that temperature has a smaller effect on the conservation of stress in the dough than molding. The current work illustrates the capability of MRI/IA for understanding and predicting the influence of food processing parameters on consumer-relevant features in a food product (bread) ...|$|R
40|$|Structure {{formation}} in dough systems {{is the result}} of an interplay between processing conditions and subsequent interactions in the protein phase. These interactions can be both of a covalent (disulfide bonds) and physical nature and occur at all length scales. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of simple shear deformation at various shear rates on wheat dough rheological properties, microstructure and GMP fraction. Shear processing was compared with a z-blade mixing. The contribution of disulfide bonds on different length scales was investigated using NEMI as SH-blocker agent. Dough strength and strain hardening decreased with the increase in shear rate leading to dough weakening. Sheared dough at low shear rate exhibited the highest strength among <b>doughs</b> <b>under</b> large deformation conditions. Mixing or shearing in the presence of NEMI strongly reduced fracture properties and GMP content of mixed and sheared doughs. Only the dough that was sheared at low shear rate still exhibited some strength and strain hardening. Large deformation results were integrated with linear viscoelastic properties using low shear rate¿long time creep tests. Elastic compliance curves for reference doughs were lower than the dough containing NEMI. Shearing at low and intermediate shear rates gave similar elastic compliance. Dough rheological behaviour was interpreted in the context of polymer gels containing reversible cross-links and physical interactions. Shearing {{led to the formation of}} a heterogeneous structure. Very large protein domains were observed for dough at low shear rate, which became smaller upon higher shear rates suggesting that those structures are quite weak. When NEMI was present, large protein structures were lost more easily. The break-up of gluten domains during mixing and shearing was proposed to be a result from a different mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Strong (sample 402) {{and weak}} (sample 401) hard wheat flour were {{selected}} and their physicochemical property changes were investigated as functions of mixing, resting and heating, {{especially in the}} aspects of rheological behavior, molecular mobility measured by NMR relaxation properties, and microstructure obtained by cry-SEM. Small deformation tests during heating agreed well with NMR relaxation times. During gelatinization, G* rapidly increased and phase angle decreased, which was correlated with the changes in three different components of T 2 signal intensities and decreasing water mobility measured by NMR relaxation times. The onset temperature {{of the increase in}} G* and the decreasing rate of phase angle were different according to mixing time. Lower water mobility in the longer mixed dough, as indicated by shorter NMR relaxation times, was related to slower onset of gelatinization, which made the phase angle decrease more slowly during gelatinization. Small deformation tests showed that, during the initial resting period, G* and phase angle decreased for undermixed dough, whereas overmixed dough showed opposite trends. The G* for optimally mixed dough was stable during resting. This was more obvious for sample 402. The large deformation tests (stress growth curve) more clearly showed the differences among optimal, <b>under</b> and overmixed <b>dough,</b> and between strong and weak flour. The optimally mixed dough showed the highest peak stress and strain at the peak for both samples, and sample 402, compared to sample 401, showed much higher peak stress and stable strain at the peak during resting, suggesting that the stability of the strain at the peak, as well as the absolute value of the peak stress and the strain at the peak must be considered to evaluate the strength and the optimum mixing time of hard wheat flour dough. The initial stress in the stress growth curve had similar trends as G* in small deformation. Decreased water mobility during resting, as indicated by decreasing NMR relaxation times, was possibly attributed to increasing molecular interactions caused by prolonged hydration, which may be related to an increase in soluble compounds observed by cryo-SEM. ...|$|R
