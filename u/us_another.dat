Improvements in natural gas furnace designs have greatly reduced CO poisoning concerns. Detectors are also available that warn of carbon monoxide and/or explosive gas (methane, propane, etc.).|$|E

The Synoptic Gospels (in {{spite of their}} many differences) introduce several important ideas, {{two of which are}} related to Greco-Judaic notions of knowledge/gnosis by virtue of being mental acts: purity of heart, in which we will to see in God's light; and repentance, which involves allowing God to judge and then transform <b>us.</b> <b>Another</b> key idea presented by the Synoptics is the desert, which is used {{as a metaphor for the}} place where we meet God in the poverty of our spirit.|$|E

However, this species has only been seen in numbers since the 2000s, with 500 reported as of 2009.

25|$|In addition, their {{daughter}} Lady Mary Elizabeth Bennet (21 May 1785 to 27 Feb, 1861) {{worked with her}} Father's gardener (William Richardson) to cultivate new strains of tri-colored viola pansy flowers that were presented to the botanical society and horticulture groups in 1812 with wide acceptance. Lady Mary Elizabeth Bennet was also an accomplished artist in watercolor and was invited to many exhibitions. She was trained by London artist John Varley. Her works are on exhibit and in private collections including a composition of her home at Belsay Castle rendered in 1834 after her marriage on 26 July 1831 to Sir Charles Miles Lambert Monck, Bt. The painting of her home at Belsay Castle in Northumberland by Lady Mary Elizabeth Monck {{was found to be}} included as part of the Monck estate in 1912 and now resides in a private collection in the <b>US.</b> <b>Another</b> of her works is the Burial Place of the Breadalbanes from the Churchyard at Killin done in 1826-1827 on a trip to the Scottish highlands with her brother. This haunting graveyard work may have been inspired by the seat of her Father's estate as the Earl of Tankerville being at Chillingham Castle which is rumored to be quite haunted. From 1815 to 1823 (before her marriage) artist Lady Mary Elizabeth Bennet also trained and worked with the genius London artist John Linnell in engraving as well as miniature painting on ivory. They together produced a set of (12) engravings about Chillingham Castle that were started in 1815 and not finished and published until 1818.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1953, the UF {{collection}} {{consisted of}} only a few hundred specimens, mostly acquired through public donation, and of little scientific value. Beginning in 1953, serious fossil prospecting began at the University of Florida, initially led by Robert S. Bader and Walter A. Auffenberg, both then members of the Department of Biology. Clayton Ray became the museum's first curator of vertebrate paleontology in 1959. He left in 1963 to take a position at the Smithsonian. Recognizing the importance of vertebrate paleontology in Florida, in 1964 museum director J. C. Dickinson hired two vertebrate paleontology curators, S. David Webb and Thomas H. Patton. Together they quickly moved the museum's research program to the forefront of the field, symbolized by their hosting in Gainesville the prestigious annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in the fall of 1964, the first time this meeting had been held in the Southeastern United States. Patton left in the mid-1970s to pursue a career in the legal profession, and was replaced in 1977 by Bruce J. MacFadden. Webb retired in 2003, and Jonathan I. Bloch was hired to fill the vacant curator position. Since 1964 the FLMNH VP curators have mentored many dozens of graduate students, produced numerous books, monographs, and research papers, and directed field operations in Florida, the Caribbean, Central and South America, and the western <b>U.S.</b> <b>Another</b> important feat was the creation of the Florida Paleontological Society and the forming of a strong bond between the professional paleontologists at the museum and the amateur fossil collectors throughout the state of Florida. Although technically curators in other museum divisions, Walter Auffenberg (Herpetology) and Charles A. Woods (Mammalogy) both had research interests that included paleontology and helped build the collection.|$|E

Dio officially joined in June, and the band began writing their next album. With a notably different vocal style from Osbourne's, Dio's addition to the band marked a change in Black Sabbath's sound. [...] "They were totally different altogether", Iommi explains. [...] "Not only voice-wise, but attitude-wise. Ozzy was a great showman, but when Dio came in, it was a different attitude, a different voice and a different musical approach, as far as vocals.

In an interview with MTV, Madonna recalled the recording of the album, and said her business partner Guy Oseary was a helpful friend, and that after she and Orbit played him the tracks, he, to their dismay, said nothing and left the studio. [...] "He really hates those icy strings. Right when I think the track's done, he sort of pushes <b>us</b> <b>another</b> step further.

In mid-February, he was averaging 22.8 points, shooting 69% from the field and 48% on three-pointers. Among his most notable performances was when he scored 43 points to lead Manchester to a 133–123 win over the Boston Blizzard on January 26. He made all 10 of his two-point shots and was 17-of-23 from the field. ProBasketballNews.com ranked him the top ABA player and the third-best minor league basketball player in the country, above players such as Ian Mahinmi, Eddie Gill, and Elton Brown. On March 17, Anderson was named to the ABA All-Star Game. He scored 19 points {{in the first half of}} the game, propelling his East team to an 18-point lead at halftime. His game-high 33 points helped him win the Halogen Records ABA All-Star Most Valuable Player Award. Manchester owner Jason Briggs said, [...] "We are very proud of Anthony. He is a super-star in the making and he has a great work ethic and is very humble to boot." [...] On April 1, 2008, Anderson was named first-team All-ABA and won the league's Most Valuable Player Award.
