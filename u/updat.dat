The thesis takes both media as a text types, which <b>updats</b> narrative. The second part is devoted to the interpretation of Erbenʼs Kytice. The interpretation is based on scientific studies that deals with poetry collection. The third section attempts to compare the two different media.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an object {{tracking}} method through deep learning-based confidence evaluation, aiming at correctly updating an object template and on-line training a {{deep neural network}}. Our method <b>updats</b> both a deep neural network and a detector in Tracking-Learning-Detection(TLD) framework by robustly finding object regions highly similar to the target. We detect tracking failure points by measuring spatiotemporal similarity from Forward-Backward Error and output of the deep neural network. In addition, the proposed method adaptively updates the templates of tracker by finding the region with highest confidence of neural network within both tracking and detection results. Our experiment results demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method in severe environmental changes. This work is supported by the ICT R&D program of MSIP/IITP(No. 10047078) ...|$|R

In {{the first part of}} the bachelor thesis deals with the film adaptations of literary works, focusing on open and closed adaptation, as way as interpreting a literary text, as the original film, the semiotics of film and finally the narrator of film. On the literature as on the film this thesis is trying to look out narratological perspective. The thesis takes both media as a text types, which <b>updats</b> narrative. The second part is dedicated to the kitsch, and describes its etymology, history, and not least its general definition. The third part of this thesis interprets Erben's Kytice, continues with comparing the two different types of media, while is trying to describe the way of adapting literary writing in to the film and compares these two media, while is trying to find a notification of kitsch.
