50|$|The most {{important}} change was {{the adoption of}} the first <b>Utilities</b> <b>Directive,</b> Directive 90/531. Public utilities - the energy, telecommunications, transport and water sectors - had so far escaped European procurement law harmonisation because of the strongly divergent national legal régimes governing them, and possibly also because their large purchasing volume constituted an instrument of national industrial policy that governments were reluctant to give up. The removal of market access barriers in this sector was largely enabled by the concurrent liberalisation of the European telecommunications industry and by the envisaged global liberalisation of public procurement in the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations. The first <b>Utilities</b> <b>Directive</b> generally followed the approach of the Supply and Works directives, but provided for the exemption of several sectors such as broadcasting, or for utilities operating under competitive conditions.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, {{procurement}} {{legislation was}} again consolidated following {{the principles of}} simplification and modernisation. The new legal framework {{is based on a}} clear-cut dichotomy between utilities {{and the rest of the}} public sector. While the procurement of the former remains governed by a new <b>Utilities</b> <b>Directive,</b> Directive 2004/17 [...] "coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors", the other three directives were amalgamated into a single [...] "Public Sector Directive", Directive 2004/18 [...] "on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts", which now governs procurement by public authorities other than utilities. The 2004 directives, apart from simplifying and clarifying the existing law, introduce a new procurement procedures, the competitive dialogue, and allow the procurement of framework agreements. They were required to be transposed into national law by 31 January 2006.|$|E
50|$|In 1993, {{the older}} Supplies, Works and <b>Utilities</b> <b>directives</b> were re-adopted in a {{consolidated}} form as Directives 93/36, 93/37 and 93/38. This {{was to make}} the legal framework more homogeneous, but the changes to the Works Directive included significant clarifications and a special, mitigated régime for the award of concession contracts.|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} claimed {{that there is}} a problem with delayed {{transposition}} of directives within the EU (European Union). However, the data on which many of these claims are made show some serious shortcomings. By using a new dataset on the transposition of <b>utilities</b> <b>directives</b> that overcomes many of these problems, this paper set out to examine if there are problems with transposition delays in the area of utilities, and if so, how these problems can be explained. It was found that in nearly half of the cases, transposition was delayed, and the average delay was about seven and a half months. There were also significant differences between the member states in this respect. In search for explanations for these differences, existing literature on the compliance with EC (European Community) law was reviewed, and this produced an extensive list of potential explanatory variables. Rather than to test all these variables, a theoretical approach, namely sociological institutionalism, was adopted in order to bring theoretical focus to the analysis. The variables that could be derived from this approach were subsequently selected and tested. Of the explanatory variables that were tested, only the variable “Government efficiency” remained significant when the grouped structure of the data was controlled for. The fact that only a low amount of the variance was accounted for in the analysis, and that the policy area (telecommunications or energy) to which a directive belongs proved to be an important factor in accounting for delays, suggests that the explanatory variables are too broad. This calls for further research in which the explanatory variables are operationalised in such a way that they are more specific to transposition and to the characteristics of a policy area within the member states...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{for the establishment}} of a public procurement complaints review and remedies system is to enforce the practical application of substantive public procurement legislation. Such a system gives this legislation its “teeth”: the possibility of review and remedies serves as a deterrent to breaking the law and thus encourages compliance. Moreover, violations of the law and genuine mistakes can be corrected. Therefore, a functioning public procurement review and remedies system may ultimately contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the substantive rules, such as non-discrimination and equal treatment, transparency, and value for money. The public procurement review and remedies systems of EU Member States need to comply with the requirements of European Community law: the EC Treaty, the EC Public Sector Remedies Directive 89 / 665 /EEC and the EC <b>Utilities</b> Remedies <b>Directive</b> 92 / 13 /EEC [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|On 20 December 2011 the European Commission {{published}} its {{proposals for}} two new procedural directives on public procurement, one to replace Public Sector Directive 2004 / 18 {{and one to}} replace <b>Utilities</b> <b>Directive</b> 2004 / 17, with the stated aims of “simplification” and “flexibilisation” (sic) of the rules to improve value for money. However, following {{the pattern of the}} previous reforms in 2004, whilst the proposals do indeed provide for some additional flexibility, they have {{at the same time in}} many respects introduced more rigidity and burdensome requirements for Member States. Furthermore, these and other changes proposed will result in a set of rules which is vastly more complex than the current regime that the proposals purport to simplify. In this context, this article proposes a simple blueprint for reforming the directives to in the shape of a single directive for all regulated contracts that is based on the <b>Utilities</b> <b>Directive,</b> although with some modifications. Such an approach will afford the flexibility necessary for Member State to promote their own procurement policies, including value for money, in an appropriate way - in particular, it will allow Member States to authorise use of procedures involving negotiation, allow them to take account of the significant benefits of qualification systems, and facilitate cost-effective approaches to advertising contracts. Further, it will greatly reduce the complexities and uncertainties that apply under the current regulatory regime. This will result both from the greater simplicity of the content of the utilities rules as compared with the rules that apply under the other directives, and from the very existence of a single regime, which, inter alia, will eliminate the need to operate under multiple regimes and to determine the boundaries between them. Thus this approach will promote both the flexibility and simplification objective of the current reform agenda whilst at the same, it is submitted, providing a suitable framework of rules for promoting the single market in public procurement in the EU...|$|E
40|$|EU public {{procurement}} legislation {{has been developed}} {{in order to promote}} principles of competition, equal treatment, mutual recognition, proportionality and transparency through the Public Sector Procurement Directive (2004 / 18 /EC) and the <b>Utilities</b> <b>Directive</b> (2004 / 17 /EC) which apply to supplies, works and services above the stipulated value thresholds procured by contracting authorities. For those economic operators who experience a breach of {{public procurement}} law a complaint can be made to the European Commission under the Article 258 procedure but this may be slow and ineffective. The Public Sector Remedies Directive and the Utilities Remedies Directive provide a new regime from December 2009 which includes inter alia a mandatory standstill period between award and contract signature in accordance with the Alcatel judgment, an obligation for Contracting Authorities (CAs) to provide feedback to tenderers and suspension of the contract award after the commencement of proceedings. The public procurement directives were developed from earlier legislation and incorporate further important principles established by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) relating to the integration of horizontal policies such as the achievement of social and environmental objectives into the public procurement process. Currently the process of modernising EU public procurement policy is underway {{in the form of a}} consultation process commencing with a green paper which seeks to invite views from all those who have a stake in public procurement with legislative proposals expected in 2012. The focus is upon the most effective ways of improving processes in order to achieve Europe 2020 objectives which set out to promote business innovation, a low-carbon economy and the participation of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Before and since the implementation of the directives in national Public Contract Regulations (PCR) there has been a series of developments in EU and member state case law which have been instrumental in establishing legal principles to address the multitude of grievances put forward by unsuccessful tenderers participating in the public procurement process. Many of the claims are focused upon the lack of equality and transparency in the bidding process and a number of cases have dealt with the problems associated with selection and award criteria. This paper examines specific aspects of the selection process which have been a cause for concern including the time limits for notification of infringement of the PCR, the discretion exercised by Contracting Authorities (CAs) in this process and the impact of Uniplex and other cases upon these issues...|$|E
40|$|In {{the area}} of public utilities, the member states of the European Union (EU) have agreed on ambitious {{policies}} to open up markets for competition and to regulate these markets. To have the expected effect, these policies have to be implemented effectively. In this book it is demonstrated that this is problematic; difficulties appear already in {{the first step of}} transposing the directives into national legislation. The analysis of an original quantitative data set including all public <b>utilities</b> <b>directives</b> and their transposition in five member states – the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Greece – shows that almost two thirds of all cases are transposed after the deadlines that are included in the directives. In order to explain problems with the implementation of EU policies, three main types of variables are used in the literature, namely political, administrative, and institutional variables. In recent literature on transposition the focus is on political explanations. However, despite a surge of attention for transposition there is no consensus regarding which type of variable is most important. In this book the focus on political variables is addressed. It is examined if such a focus is well founded, and whether and how different types of variables combine in order to produce the transposition outcome. To this end, a novel approach is taken by developing a theoretical framework that applies implementation theory to transposition. In this framework the three types of variables in the literature on transposition are combined in one coherent framework. The theoretical framework is applied mainly in a case study setting. The transposition of two packages of directives in the fields of telecommunications and energy in the Netherlands, Germany and Greece is studied in detail. The main conclusion is that political factors play an important role for the timeliness of transposition, but that a number of ‘mediating’ variables of institutional, administrative, and legal character are of crucial importance for their effect. Such variables consequently cannot be ignored in an analysis of transposition. Applying implementation theory to transposition is a useful approach as it clarifies how a combination of variables affects transposition delay. The analysis is also relevant for three of the most prominent theoretical concepts put forward in the literature on transposition, namely the number of ‘veto points’ or ‘veto players’, ‘misfit’, and the ‘worlds of compliance’. Regarding ‘veto points’, the current book shows that access to the process that does not involve a veto is also of key relevance, and that this access matters only in combination with other variables. It is also shown that while a high level of ‘misfit’ does lead to political resistance, the concept is too simplistic to be used directly as an explanatory variable. Finally, it is shown that a theoretical framework that combines different types of variables can serve as an alternative to dividing the member states into different ‘worlds of compliance’ in which different variables are of importance...|$|R
