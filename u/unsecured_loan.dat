2500|$|Grammar {{and style}} guides often differ {{as to how}} {{percentages}} are to be written. For instance, it is commonly suggested that the word percent (or per cent) be spelled out in all texts, as in [...] "1percent" [...] and not [...] "1%". Other guides prefer the word to be written out in humanistic texts, but the symbol {{to be used in}} scientific texts. Most guides agree that they always be written with a numeral, as in [...] "5percent" [...] and not [...] "five percent", the only exception being {{at the beginning of a}} sentence: [...] "Ten percent of all writers love style guides." [...] Decimals are also to be used instead of fractions, as in [...] "3.5percent of the gain" [...] and not [...] " [...] percent of the gain". However the titles of bonds issued by governments and other issuers use the fractional form, e.g. [...] "% <b>Unsecured</b> <b>Loan</b> Stock 2032 Series 2". (When interest rates are very low, the number 0 is included if the interest rate is less than 1%, e.g. [...] "0 3/4% Treasury Stock", not [...] "3/4% Treasury Stock".) It is also widely accepted to use the percent symbol (%) in tabular and graphic material.|$|E
2500|$|The Danish {{authorities}} {{were able to}} use their more cooperative stance to win important concessions for the country. They continually refused to enter a customs and currency union with Germany. Danes were concerned both about the negative economic effects of the German proposals, as well as the political ones. German officials did not want to risk their special relationship with Denmark by forcing an agreement on them, as they had done in other countries. The Danish government was also able to stall negotiations over the return of South Jutland to Germany, ban [...] "closed-rank uniformed marches" [...] that would have made nationalist German or Danish Nazi agitation more possible, keep National Socialists out of the government, and hold a relatively free election, with decidedly anti-Nazi results, {{in the middle of the}} war. Danish military officials also had access to sensitive German information, which they delivered to the Allies under government cover. The economic consequences of the occupation were also mitigated by German-Danish cooperation. Inflation rose sharply in the first year of the war, as the German Army spent a large amount of German military currency in Denmark, most importantly on military installations and troop deployments. Due to the Occupation, the National Bank of Denmark was compelled to exchange German currency for Danish notes, effectively granting the Germans a gigantic <b>unsecured</b> <b>loan</b> with only vague promises that the money would eventually be paid, something which never happened. The Danish government was later able to renegotiate the Germans' arbitrary exchange rate between the German military currency and the Danish krone to reduce this problem.|$|E
2500|$|Modi also {{revealed}} that on 25 August 2011, BJP leader Vasundhara Raje (also an opposition leader at that time) signed a document supporting his application to the British authorities. The application, which was never presented to the British authorities, had a secrecy clause {{that it should not}} be revealed to the Indian authorities. In her affidavit, Raje had claimed that Modi was a victim of a [...] "political witch hunt" [...] by the Congress. Earlier, in 2013, a Jaipur-based lawyer Poonam Chand Bhandari had filed a public interest litigation in the Delhi high court, claiming that Lalit Modi had transferred millions of rupees to a company owned by Vasundhara Raje and her son Dushyant Singh, using a shell company. Dushyant Singh owns Niyant Heritage Hotels Private Limited (NHHPL), and his mother Vasundhara Raje holds 3,280 shares in the company. In 2008, Lalit Modi's company Anand Heritage Hotels Private Limited (AHHPL) provided an <b>unsecured</b> <b>loan</b> of [...] 38 million to NHHPL. During 2008–09, AHHPL acquired 815 shares in NHHPL, paying [...] 96,000 for each share, although the face value of each share was only [...] 10. NHHPL, which previously had a paid up capital of [...] 1 million, thus received a total of 116.3 million from AHHPL. In June 2015, the Congress accused Vasundhara Raje of corruption, alleging that she had granted favours to Lalit Modi in exchange for the money. BJP argued that Raje had acted as a friend of Modi, and not in her capacity as a political leader.|$|E
