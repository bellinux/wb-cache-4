This paper takes issue with a recent contribution to this debate by Tony Norfield. We contend that the relationship between financial derivatives and the concept of &# 039;money&# 039; needs to be framed {{in the context of a}} changing understanding of liquidity, and that issues of crisis and renewed accumulation are better understood though this path than via debates about speculative versus real investment and productive versus <b>unproductive</b> <b>capital.</b> Indeed these latter taxonomies are being superseded by current developments within finance, and Marxian analysis needs to be attuned to these current developments...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{argues for}} the {{importance}} of the Marxian concept of economic crisis and counteracting forces to the tendency of the rate of profit to fall in contemporary capitalism through empirical research on the UK economy. Mergers and acquisitions, government expenditure, capital goods export, capital goods imports (EU as the main partner of the UK trade) emerged from this investigation as influenced by the rate of profit. Mergers and acquisitions and government expenditure have not previously been considered as counteracting forces within the Marx‟s approach. This study comprises the first use of VARs time series analysis with Granger causality tests on an analysis of the UK economy using Marxian variables. There was an early attempt by Glyn and Sutcliffe (1972) discussing about the profit squeeze, and using different measures for the rate of profit, but this did not contain any substantial econometric analysis or estimating any counteracting forces. A major obstacle in any estimation of Marxian variables is data availability and a lack of clarity and consistency in HMSO publications, and the work in this study to present consistent data in these terms will be valuable for any future research in this area. The significance of government expenditure as a counteracting force to the tendency of the rate of profit to fall highlights the importance of <b>unproductive</b> <b>capital</b> in Marxian analysis of crisis. Government expenditure is mainly a form of <b>unproductive</b> <b>capital,</b> and therefore growth of government expenditure affects the productivity of the economy. Unproductive labour {{has been the focus of}} a lot of analysis and literature amongst the Marxist economists but not enough emphasise has been put on the role of <b>unproductive</b> <b>capital.</b> In estimating the variables concerning the rate of profit variables and counteracting forces, I have used the money expression of value, or money terms in current prices. To justify this, I use Morishima and Seton‟s “inverse transformation” scheme to address the “transformation problem”, using input-output tables for values and prices of production, following Wolff‟s (1975) approach. The ratio of values to the prices of production was 1. 02 1 for the production industries. On the basis of this approach, I then developed a computer programme by Mathematica that enabling the calculation of values and prices of production for the UK. The study supports the view that capitalist production is a dynamic process in which the tendency of the rate of profit to fall as a form of economic crisis could find some counteracting forces to offset this tendency for a short period of time and bring about a relative stability; however, this stability does not persist forever, and crisis prevails repeatedly. This demonstrates that Marxian theory provides important insights which can address both economic crisis and growth in its theory of „the law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall‟ and counteracting influences. If we forget this dialectical relationship in the Marxian theory, by over emphasising on one aspect of the argument or the other, the result is likely to be a dogmatic ideology in place of a scientific method of inquiry...|$|E

40|$|This paper does two things. First, it {{presents}} alternative {{approaches to the}} standard methods of estimating productive efficiency using a production function. It favours a parametric approach (viz. the stochastic production frontier approach) over a non-parametric approach (e. g. data envelopment analysis); and, further, one that provides a statistical explanation of efficiency, {{as well as an}} estimate of its magnitude. Second, it illustrates the favoured approach (i. e. the ‘single stage procedure’) with estimates of two models of explained inefficiency, using data from the Thai manufacturing sector, after the crisis of 1997. Technical efficiency is modelled as being dependent on capital investment in three major areas (viz. land, machinery and office appliances) where land is intended to proxy the effects of <b>unproductive,</b> speculative <b>capital</b> investment; and both machinery and office appliances are intended to proxy the effects of productive, non-speculative capital investment. The estimates from these models cast new light on the five-year long, post- 1997 crisis period in Thailand, suggesting a structural shift from relatively labour intensive to relatively capital intensive production in manufactures from 1998 to 2002. productive efficiency, stochastic production frontier, Thai manufacturing sector...|$|R
40|$|My {{doctoral}} research {{addresses the}} question of how productive and unproductive forms of capital accumulation interact in the United States. My contribution is to first develop a new understanding of the labor theory of value in order to better explain how financial and rentier forms of revenues relate to the wealth created in productive activities. Second, I offer an innovative analysis of historical trends regarding unproductive accumulation in the postwar United States economy. For that purpose, I propose a new methodology to estimate Marxist categories from conventional input-output matrices, national income accounts, and employment data. A core feature of my methodology is the idea that the production of knowledge and information is an unproductive activity. Third, I employ time series econometric techniques to formally evaluate the coevolution between productive and unproductive forms of capital accumulation. My methods therefore consist of a combination of theoretical arguments, descriptive empirical analysis, and econometrics. The way in which productive and unproductive capitals interact has changed substantially throughout the postwar period in the United States. The accumulation pattern observed during the 1947 - 1979 phase, which prioritized productive accumulation, gave way after the 1980 s to a contrasting pattern prioritizing unproductive accumulation. Unproductive activity has been growing significantly in terms of incomes, fixed assets, and employment. Among all forms of unproductive activity, finance and the creation of knowledge and information have constituted a rising share of total unproductive income and capital stock. Furthermore, productive stagnation and unproductive accumulation have been closely related to greater exploitation of productive workers and to overall income inequality. The objective of my econometric study is to answer two questions: Does unproductive accumulation hinder or induce productive accumulation, in terms of both short- and long-run effects? Conversely, does productive stagnation lead to faster unproductive accumulation? I provide an econometric assessment of a question that other scholars have so far considered mostly through verbal or descriptive approaches. The main results are as follows. First, productive and unproductive forms of accumulation share no common trend or no stable long-run equilibrium relationship. There is, hence, no self-correcting mechanism that brings these two forms of capital accumulation back into a stable long-run equilibrium. Second, productive and unproductive forms of accumulation tend to be mutually reinforcing in the short term. Despite consuming the surplus from productive endeavors, unproductive accumulation still has a net positive effect on productive accumulation. Third, I find evidence of an absolute crowding-in effect (or positive level effect) coupled with a relative crowding-out effect (or negative share effect) between productive and unproductive forms of capital accumulation. The total value produced in productive activities grows faster when the <b>unproductive</b> <b>capital</b> grows, but slows down when the <b>unproductive</b> <b>capital</b> stock grows faster than the productive capital stock. Fourth, I find evidence of reverse causality indicating that the share of <b>unproductive</b> <b>capital</b> stock grows faster when there is a slowdown in the total value produced in productive activities. The combination of theoretical analysis and empirical findings in this study provides a new assessment of how unproductive accumulation and productive stagnation have been core features of the postwar United States economy. Predicated on the concepts of knowledge-rent and of autonomization, I offer a theoretical explanation of unproductive growth that builds on and expands Marxist political economy and the Marxist labor theory of value. The concept of knowledge-rent reveals that the commodification of knowledge expands rentier capitalism. The principle of autonomization uncovers how unproductive activities have a tendency to generate abstract forms of wealth that are increasingly separated from the production of surplus value in productive activities. Even though unproductive accumulation occurs together with rising levels of exploitation of productive workers, capitalism in the United States is an economic system that generates unproductive incomes that gradually obscure the source of new wealth in the exploitation of labor...|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between government size and economic growth in an endogenous growth model with human capital and an <b>unproductive</b> <b>capital</b> which facilitates rent-seeking. With exogenous as well as endogenous time discounting, we find a non-monotonic relationship between {{the size of government}} and economic growth. We find that with very high (low) discounting, there is a unique low (high) growth equilibrium, regardless of the size of government. For the intermediate range of discounting, there are multiple equilibria and the growth outcome depends on the size of government. With endogenous time discounting, the growth outcome is path-dependent and depends on the level of inherited human capital. However, there is only one stable growth regime and the economy endogenously switches to it. When the institutional constraints on rent seeking are not extremely high, the stable regime is the one {{in which there is a}} high-growth equilibrium for a smaller size of the government and for larger size, both the high-growth and the low-growth equilibrium coexist. When the institutional constraints on rent seeking are extremely high, there exists only a unique high-growth equilibrium irrespective of the size of government. Furthermore, economies with bigger size of the government and/or with poor quality institutions will take longer to endogenously switch to this stable growth regime...|$|E
40|$|Measured {{total factor}} {{productivity}} (TFP) falls markedly in emerging nations that experience financial crises. For instance, during its 1994 - 95 crises, standard growth accounting suggests that TFP fell by about 10 % in Mexico, which is {{twice as large as}} any other quarterly TFP drop in Mexico over the past 20 years. A possible explanation for this drop is that capital utilization falls during financial crises because, for typically short periods, interest rates (the opportunity cost of capital) are well above trend, while TFP is well below trend. We calculate that capital utilization did fall noticeably in Mexico in 1995. In models with homogenous capital, this accounts for almost a third of the drop in measured TFP. But we show that those models predict that energy consumption should be counterfactually high in Mexico. A model with heterogenous capital yields much more reasonable predictions for energy consumption, but cuts the quantitative importance of capital utilization in half. That is because it is <b>unproductive</b> <b>capital</b> that is left idle, while more resources are directed to the most productive physical capital. Our preferred estimate is that capital utilization accounted for 15 % of the drop in measured TFP in 1995 in Mexico. We also find that capital utilization accounts for but a negligible fraction of measured TFP movements in non-crisis quarters...|$|E

While the Americans were deferential toward their Edisons and talked about "good profit," the French openly scorned their bourgeoisie, regarded all profits as the results of thievery, and called them "gros profits" (fat profits).

We start with a historic introduction to the development in the Norwegian fishery sector, where the need for capacity reducing measures becomes ever clearer {{in the second quarter of}} the last century. Different measures and policies are scrutinized during the period studied, and there seems to be a clear development from subsidies and management dictate to market based incentives in the structural policies. Although introducing TAC and a fixed share of the quota to the vessel group, the fishing opportunities still fluctuates significantly. In addition, annulling subsidies causes need among the actors for innovation and efficiency. In our study, we find a vast reduction in number of vessels. However, as new and efficient vessels are introduced to the fleet, the capacity is not reduced. The findings in the paper reveal several challenges related to how to adjust the fishing capacity within the frames of the Norwegian management regime...|$|E

The second contribution of this paper is that the estimation also factors in the existence of bad debts, which is ignored by Katib et al [...] (2000). The difference in the quality of finance reflecting the difference in the management policies adopted is hard to discern when the economy is in good shape. However, as the economic situation deteriorates, bad debts come to the surface and the profitability of banks that have engaged in dubious financing deteriorates as debt arrears. In this paper, we have assumed a set of several different amounts of sound credit for individual banks, and made an estimation of the cost function for each case. In our analysis, neither economies of scale nor economies of scope, which are said to be intrinsic to the banking industry, were observed for commercial banks in Malaysia. If the view that economies of scale and economies of scope are observed in efficient bank management is correct, then it is safe to assume that the management of domestic banks in Malaysia must be inefficient. Moreover, no technological progress was observed in that cost declined over time despite the fact that the capital equipment ratio increased and labor productivity rose in the first half of the 1990 s. In studies on developed countries, a decline in cost is observed over time in a competitive market, as is progress in labor saving technology due to investment in modernization.

Firstly, different form Katib et al [...] (2000) using Data Envelop Analysis (DEA) based on a non-parametric approach. in this paper, we have estimated the cost function of Malaysian commercial banks with respect to almost the same analysis period, availing ourselves of SEA analysis based on a parametric approach. The second contribution of this paper is that the estimation also factors in the existence of bad debts, which is ignored by Katib et al [...] (2000). The difference in the quality of finance reflecting the difference in the management policies adopted is hard to discern when the economy is in good shape. However, as the economic situation deteriorates, bad debts come to the surface and the profitability of banks that have engaged in dubious financing deteriorates as debt arrears. In this paper, we have assumed a set of several different amounts of sound credit for individual banks, and made an estimation of the cost function for each case. In our analysis, neither economies of scale nor economies of scope, which are said to be intrinsic to the banking industry, were observed for commercial banks in Malaysia. If the view that economies of scale and economies of scope are observed in efficient bank management is correct, then it is safe to assume that the management of domestic banks in Malaysia must be inefficient. Moreover, no technological progress was observed in that cost declined over time despite the fact that the capital equipment ratio increased and labor productivity rose in the first half of the 1990 s. In studies on developed countries, a decline in cost is observed over time in a competitive market, as is progress in labor saving technology due to investment in modernization. Our observation results suggest that Malaysian domestic banks were making <b>unproductive</b> <b>capital</b> investment. No essential changes occurred in the analysis even when it was conducted assuming several different amounts of sound credit, i. e. factoring in the quality of credit. Moreover, on comparing our results with those of the earlier study by Katib et al [...] (2000)., based on DEA, we have found no inconsistency between the two...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I offer an {{innovative}} analysis of unproductive accumulation in the United States economy from 1947 to 2011. I {{develop a new}} theoretical and empirical framework to analyze the accumulation of capital in its productive and unproductive forms. I also develop a methodology to compute Marxist categories predicated {{on the idea that}} the production of knowledge and information is an unproductive activity that relies on the creation of knowledge-rents. In particular, I provide new empirical estimates to uncover the shifting balance between productive and unproductive forms of accumulation. The accumulation pattern observed during the 1947 - 1979 phase that prioritized productive accumulation gave way after the 1980 s to a contrasting pattern prioritizing unproductive accumulation. Unproductive activity has been growing at a fast pace in terms of incomes, fixed assets, and employment. Among all forms of unproductive activity, my approach places special attention on how the production of knowledge and information has constituted a rising share of total <b>unproductive</b> income and <b>capital</b> stock. Additionally, productive stagnation and rapid unproductive accumulation have been intrinsically related to greater exploitation of productive workers and to widening income inequality...|$|R
5000|$|The British Agricultural Revolution (17th-19th centuries) {{not only}} caused many {{changes in the}} way people worked but in social {{structure}} as well. When industrialization provided the cheapest and most efficient tools for agricultural production, it caused a reduced need for the peasant farm workers, which displaced most of the working class from the countryside. Faced with the choice of selling their labor for a wage or becoming a capitalist, there emerged a class of entrepreneurs who through the exploitation of wage laborers became the capitalist class. As the system grew, there became a need for cheaper and more readily available materials. Thus colonization was born. By expanding into new territories and enslaving indigenous cultures, primitive accumulation became a source of quick and easy capital. Famine even became a tool for capitalists in 1769-1770 when England raised the price of rice in India so that only the rich could afford it. National debt soon became a tool of control for capitalists who turned <b>unproductive</b> money into <b>capital</b> through lending and exchange. Encouraged to participate in the creation of debt, each worker participates in the creation of [...] "joint-stock companies, the stock-exchange, and modern bankocracy." [...] The international credit system conceals the source of its generation; the exploitation of slave and wage laborers.|$|R
60|$|First {{among them}} is the waste of capital in periods of {{overtrading}} and rash speculation, and in the commercial revulsions by which such times are always followed. Mines are opened, railways or bridges made, and many other works of uncertain profit commenced, and in these enterprises much capital is sunk which yields either no return, or none adequate to the outlay. Factories are built and machinery erected beyond what the market requires, or can keep in employment. Even if they are kept in employment, the capital is no less sunk; it has been converted from circulating into fixed capital, and has ceased to have any influence on wages or profits. Besides this, there is a great <b>unproductive</b> consumption of <b>capital</b> during the stagnation which follows a period of general overtrading. Establishments are shut up, or kept working without any profit. Such are the effects of a commercial revulsion; and that such revulsions are almost periodical is a consequence of the very tendency of profits which we are considering. By the time a few years have passed over without a crisis, so much additional capital has been accumulated that it is no longer possible to invest it at the accustomed profit; all public securities rise to a high price, the rate of interest on the best mercantile security falls very low, and the complaint is general among persons in business that no money is to be made. But the diminished scale of all safe gains inclines persons to give a ready ear to any projects which hold out, though at the risk of loss, the hope of a higher rate of profit; and speculations ensue, which, with the subsequent revulsions, destroy, or transfer to foreigners, a considerable amount of capital, produce a temporary rise of interest and profit, make room for fresh accumulations, and the same round is recommenced.|$|R
40|$|Introduction This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays in equilibrium asset pricing. The first chapter studies the asset pricing implications of a general equilibrium model in which real investment is reversible at a cost. Firms face higher costs in contracting than in expanding their capital stock and decide to invest when their productive capital is scarce relative to the overall capital of the economy. Positive shocks to {{the capital of the}} firm increase the size of the firm and reduce the value of growth options. As a result, the firm is burdened with more <b>unproductive</b> <b>capital</b> and its value lowers with respect to the accumulated capital. The optimal consumption policy alters the optimal allocation of resources and affects firm's value, generating mean-reverting dynamics for the M/B ratios. The model (1) captures convergence of price-to-book ratios -negative for growth stocks and positive for value stocks - (firm migration), (2) generates deviations from the classic CAPM in line with the cross-sectional variation in expected stock returns and (3) generates a non-monotone relationship between Tobin's q and conditional volatility consistent with the empirical evidence. The second chapter proposes a standard portfolio-choice problem with transaction costs and mean reversion in expected returns. In the presence of transactions costs, no matter how small, arbitrage activity does not necessarily render equal all riskless rates of return. When two such rates follow stochastic processes, it is not optimal immediately to arbitrage out any discrepancy that arises between them. The reason is that immediate arbitrage would induce a definite expenditure of transactions costs whereas, without arbitrage intervention, there exists some, perhaps sufficient, probability that these two interest rates will come back together without any costs having been incurred. Hence, one can surmise that at equilibrium the financial market will permit the coexistence of two riskless rates that are not equal to each other. For analogous reasons, randomly fluctuating expected rates of return on risky assets will be allowed to differ even after correction for risk, leading to important violations of the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The combination of randomness in expected rates of return and proportional transactions costs is a serious blow to existing frictionless pricing models. Finally, in the last chapter I propose a two-countries two-goods general equilibrium economy with uncertainty about the fundamentals' growth rates to study the joint behavior of equity volatilities and correlation at the business cycle frequency. I assume that dividend growth rates jump from one state to other, while countries' switches are possibly correlated. The model is solved in closed-form and the analytical expressions for stock prices are reported. When calibrated to the empirical data of United States and United Kingdom, the results show that, given the existing degree of synchronization across these business cycles, the model captures quite well the historical patterns of stock return volatilities. Moreover, I can explain the time behavior of the correlation, but exclusively under the assumption of a global business cycle...|$|E

The South African rate of inflation has, {{by the time this}} study was undertaken, showed resistance to reduce in the face of several years of demand management policies. It was this resistance that led to the idea that the South African inflation rate might be the result of several structural factors in the economy. The study was done in three separate stages. In the first, a study of the conventional theories of inflation, the demand-pull and cost push theories, was done. The main objective was to establish whether inflation could be controlled by the medicine these theories prescribed. In section two, the different schools of thought as regards the structural approach to inflation were analyzed. The structuralist school, developed during the late 1950 s, described inflation as the result of productivity discrepancies mainly between the agricultural and industrial sectors. The structural school, which developed during the early 1970 s has two variations. The first, the Scandinavian variant, ascribes inflation to the existing productivity gap between the international competing sectors and the domestic sectors, whilst no corresponding gap in salaries between the relevant sectors exists. The second variant designates inflation to the gap existing between the labour productivity in the public and private sectors. Here again, no such salary gap exists between the sectors. The last structural inflation school of thought discussed was the one prevailing in the USA. This school saw inflation {{as the result of the}} <b>unproductive</b> use of <b>capital</b> and labour when measured against the incomes generated by the same factors of production. In section three of the study, the abovementioned theories of structural inflation were empirically applied in the South African context. In all cases very definite pointers, indicating the applicability ·of these theories in the South African situation were found. In all cases two main sector groups were constructed; each consisted as the sum of the weighted productivity of wages of the sectors belonging to that sector group i. e. internationally or domestically competitive and public or private competing groups. The constructed series for labour productivity and wages and salaries for the different sector groups were then compared...|$|R
40|$|Over the years, optimal {{taxation}} {{has been}} extensively discussed, and a major {{focus has been on}} the question of whether the optimal capital income tax rate is zero in long-run equilibrium. This paper addresses this issue in the context of a model of vintage capital with technical change and the entry and exit of new plants. It considers the optimal combinations of three taxes, including taxes on capital income, labor income, and property. The tax base for the property tax is plant value, which is determined by the plant’s productivity. Each plant is endowed with one unit of capital, which cannot be replaced or upgraded during the plant’s lifetime, although plant productivity is a combination of the vintage of capital and learning by doing. The tax base for the property tax is relatively large compared to that for capital income. There is a trade-off between these two rates in that a much lower tax rate on property is needed to satisfy a given level of government expenditure, while on the other hand the property tax rate has an effect on the exit threshold of plants and hence on the distribution of plant productivity. In this model there are two types of plants. One type is complete and able to produce the final good, while the other type is under development process and subject to a time-to-build constraint. Only the producing plant is subject to the property tax. In the steady state this paper documents interesting interactions between the capital income tax and the property tax. One special case of interest is the optimal capital income tax rate given different level of exogenous government expenditure when the property tax rate is fixed at zero. (Government expenditure is assumed to be <b>unproductive.)</b> Subsidies on <b>capital</b> income and property are considered. In addition to looking at the steady state, transitional paths including exit and entry rates of plants, and social welfare, are derived under two situations, one in which there is a shock to embodied technology, and one in which there is a shock to the path of exogenous government expenditures. Some results to date indicate that for a large range of values the steady state optimal tax rates include a positive tax on property matched with a subsidy to capital income...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of innovation in service industries {{is a recent}} concern, as much for researchers as public authorities. The importance of service industries in our economies, whether it is measured by their contribution to employment or to the gross domestic product, has led researchers and authorities alike to reconsider a number of analyses inherited from the industrial and agricultural past; analyses which regard services as a residual sector, peripheral and undynamic; <b>unproductive,</b> with low <b>capital</b> intensity and skill levels; and, the point which interests us here, resistant to innovation. This idea that services innovate little can actually {{be broken down into}} two propositions: 1) they do not innovate at all; 2) they merely adopt technical systems designed and produced by the manufacturing sector, to which they adopt a subordinate attitude. If they are involved in innovation at all, it is more as clients of innovative firms than as innovators. A number of studies have highlighted the biased nature of these conclusions. Indeed, they are based on an industrial and technologist conception of innovation which cannot be applied to manufacturing anymore as well. The studies to which we refer, however, try to take account of the specificities generally attributed to services, namely their intangible and relational nature. A service is not only an end result, it is also an act, a process which unfolds over time and {{in the context of a}} (coproductive) relationship between a client and a service provider. Consequently, it cannot be stocked, and is difficult to repair. Similarly, it is difficult to separate the “product” from the process. Conceptions of innovation in services (and also in goods), and, consequently, the evaluation of its importance, can change if the specificities of innovation in services are taken into account. In other words, not only does innovation exist in services, but it is also far from being marginal. It can take different forms and be organised differently, etc. We do not intend to go over the different results in detail here. What must be remembered, however, is that they have stemmed, essentially, from qualitative studies based on interviews and monographs. Indeed, this kind of methodology appears to be most effective when the field of research is widely unknown and unexploited, and when the aim is to avoid sticking firmly to established conceptions (definitions, indicators etc.) which have become rigidified by practice, but which are not fully adapted to the economic phenomena being studied. In other words, qualitative studies are useful in that they allow what could be called conceptual and analytical “irreversibilities” to be circumvented to a certain extent. The object of this study is to go beyond this methodological stage, and to try and provide (in the case of France) generalisable quantitative results on innovation in services, based on a wide-ranging postal survey. The design of the questionnaire obviously integrates the results of the qualitative studies referred to above, particularly in terms of the definition and nature of innovation...|$|R
