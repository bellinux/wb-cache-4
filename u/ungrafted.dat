25|$|Because of {{this most}} of the {{vineyards}} in Argentina are planted on <b>ungrafted</b> rootstock. There are many theories about why phylloxera has not yet reach {{this part of the}} world. The centuries-old tradition of flood irrigation where water is allowed to deeply saturate the soil may be one reason, as is the high proportion of sand present in the soil. The relative isolation of Argentina is also cited as a potential benefit against phylloxera with the country's wine regions being bordered by mountains, deserts and oceans that create natural barriers against the spread of the louse. Despite the minimal risk of phylloxera, some producers are switching to grafted rootstock that provide better yield control.|$|E
25|$|Viticulture in Washington State {{is deeply}} {{influenced}} {{by the use of}} irrigation and the water rights associated with suitable vineyard land. Sourced from the major rivers that run through the area, most vineyards in Eastern Washington are irrigated though some vineyards (especially in the slightly wetter Walla Walla Valley near the Blue Mountains), but some have begun experimenting with dry farming. The ever-present threat of severe winter frost has influenced viticultural practices including the adoption of wind turbines to churn and circulate air in the vineyard. In the late 20th century, many producers began adapting Russian vine-training techniques for fan-training which promotes better air circulation among the vine so cold air doesn't settle on the vine. Due to the minimal risk exposure to phylloxera, some producers have opted to leave their vines <b>ungrafted</b> on its original rootstock since an exposed graft union is more vulnerable to frost damage. One benefit of the traditionally cold winters is that the grapevines are allowed to go into full dormancy, which allows the vines to shut down and conserve energy that will be vital {{at the beginning of the}} new growth cycle for the vine. The threat of freezing condition is the main viticultural hazard that vine growers need to concern themselves with since the lack of rainfall during the summer and autumn contribute to the dry, arid conditions that allows most of Washington vineyards to be relatively disease free.|$|E

6000|$|So {{much for}} the more civilized apple-trees (urbaniores, as Pliny calls them). I love better {{to go through the}} old {{orchards}} of <b>ungrafted</b> apple-trees, at whatever season of the year,--so irregularly planted: sometimes two trees standing close together; and the rows so devious that you would think that they not only had grown while the owner was sleeping, but had been set out by him in a somnambulic state. The rows of grafted fruit will never tempt me to wander amid them like these. But I now, alas, speak rather from memory than from any recent experience, such ravages have been made! ...|$|E
60|$|And {{this being}} quite indisputably the broad {{fact of the}} matter, I greatly marvel that your historians never, so far as I have read, think of proposing to you the question--what you might have made of yourselves {{without the help of}} Homer and Phidias: what sort of beings the Saxon and the Celt, the Frank and the Dane, might have been by this time, {{untouched}} by the spear of Pallas, unruled by the rod of Agricola, and sincerely the native growth, pure of root, and <b>ungrafted</b> in fruit of the clay of Isis, rock of Dovrefeldt, and sands of Elbe? Think of it, and think chiefly what form the ideas, and images, of your natural religion might probably have taken, if no Roman missionary had ever passed the Alps in charity, and no English king in pilgrimage.|$|E
60|$|Miriam dreamed in her uneasy sleep, and in {{this dream}} many visions came to her. She saw this sacred hill of Moriah, whereon the Temple stood, {{as it had been}} in the beginning, a rugged spot clothed with <b>ungrafted</b> carob trees and olives, and inhabited, not of men, but by wild boars and the hyænas that preyed upon their young. Almost in its centre lay a huge black stone. To this stone came a man clad in the garb of the Arabs of the desert, and with him a little lad whom he bound upon the stone as though to offer him in sacrifice. Then, as he was about to plunge a knife into his heart, a glory shone round the place, and a voice cried to him to hold his hand. That was a vision of the {{offering}} of Isaac. It passed, and there came another vision.|$|E
6000|$|I will {{conclude}} with a few allied cases, which may be ranked either under bud-variation, or under the direct action of the conditions of life. When the common Hepatica is transplanted from its native woods, the flowers change colour, even during the first year. (11/87. Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 2 page 84.) It is notorious that the improved varieties of the Heartsease (Viola tricolor), when transplanted, often produce flowers widely different in size, form, and colour: for instance, I transplanted a large uniformly-coloured dark purple variety, whilst in full flower, and it then produced much smaller, more elongated flowers, with the lower petals yellow; these were succeeded by flowers marked with large purple spots, and ultimately, {{towards the end of}} the same summer, by the original large dark purple flowers. The slight changes which some fruit-trees undergo from being grafted and regrafted on various stocks (11/88. M. Carriere has lately described in the 'Revue Horticole' December 1, 1866 page 457, an extraordinary case. He twice inserted grafts of the Aria vestita on thorn- trees (epines) growing in pots; and the grafts, as they grew, produced shoots with bark, buds, leaves, petioles, petals, and flower-stalks, all widely different from those of the Aria. The grafted shoots were also much hardier, and flowered earlier, than those on the <b>ungrafted</b> Aria.) were considered by Andrew Knight (11/89. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 2 page 160.) as closely allied to [...] "sporting branches," [...] or bud-variations. Again, we have the case of young fruit-trees changing their character as they grow old; seedling pears, for instance, lose with age their spines and improve in the flavour of their fruit. Weeping birch-trees, when grafted on the common variety, do not acquire a perfect pendulous habit until they grow old: on the other hand, I shall hereafter give the case of some weeping ashes which slowly and gradually assumed an upright habit of growth. All such changes, dependent on age, may be compared with the changes, alluded to in the last chapter, which many trees naturally undergo; as in the case of the Deodar and Cedar of Lebanon, which are unlike in youth, whilst they closely resemble each other in old age; and as with certain oaks, and with some varieties of the lime and hawthorn. (11/90. For the cases of oaks see Alph. De Candolle in 'Bibl. Univers.' Geneva November 1862; for limes etc. Loudon's 'Gard. Mag.' volume 11 1835 page 503.)] ...|$|E

5000|$|Vieille Vignes Françaises (vintage): Regarded as Bollinger's {{prestige}} cuvee, this blanc de noirs is made {{in small}} quantity with wine from two small plots of <b>ungrafted</b> rootstock planted in low density (3000 vines per hectare). The English wine writer Cyril Ray suggested {{the idea of using}} the <b>ungrafted</b> vines to produce a separate wine to Madame Bollinger in the 1960s. The first vintage was 1969. The total area of vines used for this rare Champagne is less than half a hectare. Vieille Vignes refers to how the vines are trained rather than the age of the rootstock. The low-density vineyards, Clos St-Jacques in Aÿ and Chaudes Terres in Aÿ, are severely pruned, and thus produce 35% less juice per vine, creating a [...] "super rich wine." [...] In 2005, phylloxera destroyed the third vineyard used for this wine, Croix Rouge in Bouzy. Bottles are numbered and the annual production of the <b>ungrafted</b> plots has varied between 3000 and 5000 bottles.|$|E
50|$|The {{vineyards}} {{also include}} some rare <b>ungrafted</b> French vines {{from before the}} phylloxera epidemic. Bollinger owns vines {{in the heart of}} the Champagne region, including the crus of Aÿ, Bouzy and Verzenay.|$|E

50|$|Until 2005, three tiny {{parcels of}} <b>ungrafted</b> Pinot noir that escaped {{phylloxera}} {{were used to}} produce Bollinger Vieilles Vignes Françaises, one of the rarest and most expensive Champagnes available.

50|$|Jumilla {{in southeastern}} Spain is an {{important}} area of <b>ungrafted</b> vineyards, mainly from Monastrell grapes.

5000|$|Though not {{claiming}} to have invented it, Liem was in 2008 commended by Eric Asimov for discovering the word [...] "gob-less" [...] as a term for wines of grace, balance and finesse, {{in response to the}} trend among wine critics such as Robert Parker who frequently apply the word [...] "gobs" [...] to describe wines of overwhelming power and fruity sweetness. Similarly in 2009, Asimov expressed appreciation of a Liem column comparing wines made from <b>ungrafted</b> vines with cheese made from unpasteurized milk.|$|E
50|$|Prié blanc is {{an early}} {{ripening}} grape variety that has good winter-hardiness and resistance to frost. The grapevine is susceptible to several other viticultural hazards including various rots and the grapevine moth species Eupoecilia ambiguella. Most vines of Prié blanc are <b>ungrafted</b> due to phylloxera's difficulties surviving in the harsh climate conditions of the Valle d'Aosta. In order to maximize the amount of heat needed to fully ripen, vines of Prié blanc are usually trained in low pergola systems near to the ground so that the vines can capture the heat radiating from the soil.|$|E
50|$|Charles Claude Guthrie (September 26, 1880 - April 1963) was an American physiologist. He {{was born}} at Gilmore, St. Charles Co., Mo., and {{graduated}} (M.D.) from the University of Missouri in 1901 and (Ph.D.) from the University of Chicago in 1908; taught physiology while engaged in advanced studies, and was professor of physiology and pharmacology at Washington University in 1906-1909 and at the University of Pittsburgh after 1909. He was author of Blood-Vessel Surgery and its Applications (1912) and of contributions on blood reactions and alterations, resuscitation, cerebral and other anæmias, isolated and <b>ungrafted</b> tissues, and sutures and anastomosis of blood vessels.|$|E
50|$|Many have {{suggested}} that this failure was predictable, as one parent of AxR1 {{is in fact a}} susceptible V. vinifera cultivar. But the transmission of phylloxera tolerance is more complex, as is demonstrated by the continued success of 41B, an F1 hybrid of Vitis berlandieri and Vitis vinifera. The full story of the planting of AxR1 in California, its recommendation, the warnings, financial consequences, and subsequent recriminations remains to be told. Modern phylloxera infestation also occurs when wineries are in need of fruit immediately, and choose to plant <b>ungrafted</b> vines rather than wait for grafted vines to be available.|$|E
50|$|Together {{with her}} partner and {{winemaking}} consultant, Hans Vinding-Diers, she co-founded the Noemía de Patagonia in 2002, in Argentina. This Bodega Noemìa de Patagonia’s project {{had been established}} in 1998 by subsuming an old vine Malbec vineyard in the Rio Negro Valley that was planted in the 1930s and 1950s. The vines are <b>ungrafted</b> and planted on their rootstock in the Patagonian Desert which has little risk of developing phylloxera.

50|$|The wine making {{region of}} the Valle d'Aosta is {{generally}} divided into three areas. In the northwest, the Valdigne area south of the commune of Courmayeur {{is home to the}} highest elevated vineyards in Europe at 3,937 feet above sea level. The white grape Prié Blanc (also known as Blanc de Morgex)is the main production grape in the area and is used to produce the wine Blanc de Morgex et de la Salle in both a still and sparkling wine style. Due to its high elevations, the area has never been affected by phylloxera louse which has allowed the vineyards of this area to remain with <b>ungrafted</b> rootstock.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{this most}} of the {{vineyards}} in Argentina are planted on <b>ungrafted</b> rootstock. There are many theories about why phylloxera has not yet reach {{this part of the}} world. The centuries-old tradition of flood irrigation where water is allowed to deeply saturate the soil may be one reason, as is the high proportion of sand present in the soil. The relative isolation of Argentina is also cited as a potential benefit against phylloxera with the country's wine regions being bordered by mountains, deserts and oceans that create natural barriers against the spread of the louse. Despite the minimal risk of phylloxera, some producers are switching to grafted rootstock that provide better yield control.|$|E
50|$|Like many Vitis vinifera varieties, plantings of Bouchalès were {{decimated}} {{during the}} phylloxera epidemic {{of the late}} 19th century. The fact that Bouchalès experienced difficulties in taking the grafting of American rootstock (like Vitis riparia and Vitis rupestris) also contributed to its decline. However, in 2009 a Libournais vineyard belonging to Château de la Vieille Chapelle was discovered to contain <b>ungrafted</b> Bouchalès vines over 100 years old. Wine expert Jancis Robinson and others have speculated that these vines survived the phylloxera epidemic due to the frequent winter flood irrigation of the vineyards that was a tradition of Libournais viticulture for many centuries. This flooding with waters from the nearby Dordogne River would disrupt {{the life cycle of}} the phylloxera louse by inhibiting its growth during its nymph stage.|$|E
50|$|When it is {{difficult}} to match a plant to the soil in a certain field or orchard, growers may graft a scion onto a rootstock that is compatible with the soil. It may then be convenient to plant a range of <b>ungrafted</b> rootstocks to see which suit the growing conditions best; the fruiting characteristics of the scion may be considered later, once the most successful rootstock has been identified. Rootstocks are studied extensively and often are sold with a complete guide to their ideal soil and climate. Growers determine the pH, mineral content, nematode population, salinity, water availability, pathogen load and sandiness of their particular soil, and select a rootstock which is matched to it. Genetic testing is increasingly common, and new cultivars of rootstock are always being developed.|$|E
