500|$|In May 1974, Los Angeles Times critic Robert Hilburn {{reviewed}} the second New York Dolls album, Too Much Too Soon. [...] "I told ya the New York Dolls were the real thing," [...] he wrote, describing the album as [...] "perhaps {{the best example}} of raw, thumb-your-nose-at-the-world, punk rock since the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main Street." [...] Bassist Jeff Jensen of Boston's Real Kids reports of a show that year, [...] "A reviewer for one of the free entertainment magazines of the time caught the act and gave <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> review, calling us a 'punk band.'... e all sort of {{looked at each other and}} said, 'What's punk?'" [...] In a 1974 interview for his fanzine Heavy Metal Digest Danny Sugerman told Iggy Pop [...] "You went on record as saying you never were a punk" [...] and Iggy replied [...] "...well I ain't. I never was a punk." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{generated}} {{some political}} controversy. Republican members of Congress {{complained about the}} film's obviously leftist politics, and demanded that Will H. Hays, President of the Motion Picture Production Code, establish guidelines regarding propagandization for the motion picture industry. Critical reaction {{at the time was}} mixed. While at least one reviewer felt the film was reminiscent of motion pictures like Citizen Kane and Rebecca, Hedda Hopper called it [...] "Citizen Kane with all the art scraped off". Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times, concluded that while {{the first half of the}} film was very good, the latter half felt slow and failed to deliver emotional punch. Crowther called the film [...] "a courageous and timely drama" [...] and praised Tracy and Hepburn for performances that featured [...] "taut solemnity". But the script seemed uneven dramatically ("...the nature of this story is a murder mystery and yet the interest is centered much more upon the dead man than on the hunt"), and a critical problem was that the audience [...] "is informed much sooner than the journalist what the nature of Forrest was, and the story drags while we wait for the journalist to catch up." [...] Crowther still enjoyed Cukor's direction, which he felt sustained mystery even when little existed. Like Crowther, the Chicago Tribune and other critics pointed out that the picture seemed slow. The Hartford Courant, meanwhile, raved about the film: [...] "Hepburn and Tracy have given <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> film in Keeper of the Flame... Great because of the courage and daring it took to make it, the magnificent production it has been given, the excellent acting within it, and the exciting, tense story it contains." [...] Generally speaking, the film was better received in the eastern half of the United States.|$|E
2500|$|In the <b>U.S.,</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of this {{research}} has been accomplished through partnerships between government agencies and government-supported research institutes housed at universities. Because U.S. regulation of occupational road safety is largely limited {{to the safety of}} large trucks and buses, these institutes have focused on providing the evidence base to support changes to the FMCSA safety regulations that cover these larger vehicles. [...] Two research institutes that conduct much of the research on heavy-vehicle safety are the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) and the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI).|$|E

2500|$|Businessman George Elam McInnis (born 1945), the {{chairman}} of the chamber of commerce when Brown was hired as the manager, noted Brown's [...] "enthusiasm and vigor. He gave <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> hope of growth for the chamber. At the end of a year, some of us encouraged him to run for mayor even though it would be an uphill run for someone who was not from Minden." [...] McInnis noted that Brown would ride in police cars and on garbage trucks to get a better feel of the job of managing the city.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to transforming our workplace and everyday life, Davidson argues that technology allows <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> opportunity {{to rethink the}} way we teach and organize our education system. In {{addition to}} the famous iPod experiment described earlier, Davidson suggests that gaming, blogging, self-grading, and collaborative learning are among the effective and innovative teaching tools and strategies, whose benefits outweigh those offered by the [...] "one-size-fits-all model of standards that evolved {{over the course of}} the twentieth century." [...] In the chapter, [...] "Project Classroom Makeover," [...] Davidson argues that the current education system is blind to the ways in which children learn and solve complex problems today, such as: creating and memorizing names and avatars of online game players, creating and writing simple codes to advance in games, searching internet for new information, and engaging with it in new creative ways. If the education system harnesses these natural curiosities through restructured curricula, it can promote creative and critical thinking and allow students to develop in their own, unique ways, rather than forcing them to fit into the standardized system of skills.|$|E
2500|$|The {{study of}} old {{instruments}} and historic performance practice has taught <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal, {{but the main}} point, the impact of harmony, has been ignored. This is proved {{by the fact that}} tempo is described as an independent phenomenon. It is claimed that one of Bach's gavottes must be played fast and another one slowly. But tempo is not independent! … I think that concerning oneself purely with historic performance practice and the attempt to reproduce the sound of older styles of music-making is limiting and no indication of progress. Mendelssohn and Schumann tried to introduce Bach into their own period, as did Liszt with his transcriptions and Busoni with his arrangements. In America Leopold Stokowski also tried to do it with his arrangements for orchestra. This was always the result of [...] "progressive" [...] efforts to bring Bach closer to the particular period. I have no philosophical problem with someone playing Bach and making it sound like Boulez. My problem is more with someone who tries to imitate the sound of that time… ...|$|E

2500|$|Building on his {{observations}} as a psychologist, Ralea gave a humanistic praise to dilettantism and vitality, {{in the face}} of philosophical sobriety. He commended Ion Luca Caragiale, the creator of modern Romanian humor, as the voice of lucidity, equating irony with intelligence. As noted by Călinescu, Ralea [...] "either intentionally or unconsciously [...] that intense flippancy is in fact sobriety". Ralea did have his uncertainties about the grounding of his own idea. Caragiale's humor risked making Romanians too accepting of their superficiality: [...] "maybe this genius portraitist of our bourgeoisie has done <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> harm". During his polemic with Sburătorul modernism, Ralea attacked the new schools of aesthetics for their artificiality and obsessiveness: [...] "Not one of the truly terrible chapters in life is familiar to [...] They are not humans, just clowns. [...] Only the demented and children are unilateral. True aesthetics expresses the mature and normal spiritual functions. The alternative is comparative or infantile aesthetics". According to Monica Lovinescu, his critique of [...] "lassitude" [...] and [...] "cowardice" [...] in urban life is [...] "a severe diagnostic of his own disease." ...|$|E
2500|$|Foster the People {{issued its}} first {{commercial}} non-single release in January 2011, a self-titled EP featuring [...] "Pumped Up Kicks", [...] "Houdini", and [...] "Helena Beat" [...] that {{was intended to}} hold fans over until their first studio album, Torches, was completed. Fans who purchased the EP through the iTunes Store were able to apply it towards the purchase of their full-length debut album. The EP drew the attention of organizers of March's South by Southwest festival, as well as executives looking to license music for upcoming season finales of television series. Columbia senior director of creative licensing Jonathan Palmer said, [...] "The plan helped <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal to set up more opportunities rather than chasing the release date. So {{by the time we}} put the record out in May, we had already placed several songs." [...] Half of Torches songs were licensed—among them are: [...] "Pumped Up Kicks" [...] (Gossip Girl, The Vampire Diaries, Friends with Benefits, Entourage), [...] "Houdini" [...] (Gossip Girl); [...] "Helena Beat" [...] (The Vampire Diaries); [...] "Don't Stop (Color on the Walls)" [...] (Suits, Nissan Motors commercial); and [...] "Call It What You Want" [...] (FIFA 12). Palmer commented, [...] "I haven't seen this kind of a range of song licenses from one album since we worked the first Ting Tings record three-and-a-half years ago. That was an album where we licensed nine or [...] 10 songs on the album. We're kind of in a similar situation [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Perry’s 22nd book (10th on cricket) was {{the fourth}} {{in a series of}} five volumes drawn from his years of {{interviews}} with Sir Donald Bradman—Bradman’s Invincibles. The Sydney Morning Herald noted: [...] "This is a wonderful insider’s view of the (1948 Ashes) series... Perry is a good, unpretentious writer and the story he has to tell is one of courage and drama... It is a great Australian yarn." [...] Adrian Nesbitt in Sydney’s Sun Herald wrote: [...] "Perry paints an excellent background picture of a tour that is remembered by Australians as a triumph over the mother country, often without consideration that England was still bearing the scars of war... Perry creates suspenseful moments, in the dressing-room and on the field... His meticulous approach gives <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> understanding of the subtleties and room for instinct that were Bradman trademarks." [...] Teri Louise Kelly in Independent Weekly said, [...] "Perry’s work, much like Bradman himself, is head and shoulders above the competition... Bradman’s Invincibles leads the reader into the dusty backrooms, on to windy training pitches and mid-Test; beautifully written and accompanies by excellent photographs." [...] David Stanley in Cricket Boundary Magazine commented: [...] "Bradman’s Invincibles is required reading for all cricket lovers, particularly those of the younger brigade who may not know much about the players, apart from Bradman, who made up his remarkable team... It is a good read and I recommend it." [...] Inside Sport noted: [...] "Perry’s prose provides worthwhile insight into the mechanics of Bradman’s mind." [...] Neil Harvey, one the Invincibles stars, [...] said: [...] "I found it a very entertaining read. It brought memories flooding back." ...|$|E
