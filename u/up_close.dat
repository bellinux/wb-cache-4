5|$|A red-painted {{house for}} the {{signalman}} was put <b>up</b> <b>close</b> to the station. Tryvandsbanen also developed plans for building a station house with a waiting shed, but these never materialised. The name of the red-painted house was changed from Nordpolen ("The North Pole") to Norden ("The North") and it was modernised after {{the removal of the}} tracks. The station was included on the Nordmarka maps published in 1913 and 1938.|$|E
5|$|Although {{five times}} more {{elements}} are metals than nonmetals, two of the nonmetals—hydrogen and helium—make up over 99 per cent of the observable Universe, and one—oxygen—makes <b>up</b> <b>close</b> to half of the Earth's crust, oceans and atmosphere. Living organisms are also composed almost entirely of nonmetals, and nonmetals form many more compounds than metals.|$|E

As she did so, Queen Charlotte also became briefly entangled with Jacobin, and exchanged fire with her too, causing serious damage to both French ships.|$|E

5|$|<b>Up!</b> <b>Close</b> and Personal is {{the fourth}} live video album by Canadian singer Shania Twain. It was {{directed}} by Beth McCarthy-Miller, and produced by team composed of Dan Braun, Cliff Burnstein, Carol Donovan, McCarthy-Miller, Peter Mensch, and Marc Reiter. The concert was filmed in November 2003 at a sound stage in Nashville, Tennessee, with an audience of 300 people. When conceptualizing the show, Twain desired to make the setting intimate and perform the songs acoustically, so she turned to bluegrass band Alison Krauss and Union Station to perform backup during the concert. It was also modeled after Elvis Presley's '68 Comeback Special, with a similar stage and Twain being costumed by black, leather jumpsuit. <b>Up!</b> <b>Close</b> and Personal premiered on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) on November 25, 2003, and was high in ratings, being watched by over 9 million viewers in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Hadji Ali (c.1887–92– November5, 1937) was a {{vaudeville}} performance artist, {{thought to}} be of Egyptian descent, who was famous for acts of controlled regurgitation. His best-known feats included water spouting, smoke swallowing, and nut and handkerchief swallowing followed by disgorgement in an order chosen by the audience. Ali's most famous stunt, and the highlight of his act, was drinking copious amounts of water followed by kerosene, and then acting by turns as a human flamethrower and fire extinguisher as he expelled the two liquids onto a theatrical prop. While these stunts were performed, a panel of audience members was invited to watch the show <b>up</b> <b>close</b> to verify that no trickery was employed.|$|E
5|$|Located atop a {{mountain}} in the Gongen Mountain Park, Seto Wind Hill Park {{is located in the}} center of the peninsula and is free and open to the public. From it you can see dozens of Ikata's 29.5-meter, 4.3-ton windmills, and get <b>up</b> <b>close</b> to 11 of them. An actual wing of one of the windmills is on display in the park so visitors can get a better idea of the actual size. Benches and observation decks dot the park and Haikus about the windmills, submitted for Ikata's Windmill Festival, are on display year-round.|$|E

5|$|The Germans {{had very}} {{little in the way of}} heavy weapons, as they had {{discarded}} most of their artillery and machine guns due to lack of ammunition. Despite the chronic ammunition shortage von Lettow-Vorbeck was able to move four machine guns <b>up</b> <b>close</b> to the rifle pits, using them only at close range to ensure his ammunition would not be wasted. The inexperience of the Portuguese proved to be their downfall; despite their firing over 30,000 rounds, German casualties were extremely light, including only one casualty among their officers. Taking heavy casualties, having lost their commanding officer, and finding themselves hopelessly outnumbered, the Portuguese finally surrendered despite the fact that they had enough military supplies to continue the action.|$|E
5|$|The main {{entrance}} to the castle would have involved crossing a stone bridge between the two easterly ditch bridge towers and the main gatehouse; little remains of the bridge towers today and a timber entrance way to the gatehouse replaces the bridge. A water gate overlooks a protected stairway of 127 steps that runs down {{to the foot of}} the cliffs. In the 13th century, the sea came <b>up</b> <b>close</b> to the stairway, allowing resupply by sea, but today the sea has retreated significantly, making it more difficult to envisage the concept in its original setting.|$|E
5|$|The {{scale of}} {{camouflage}} patterns {{is related to}} their function. Large structures need larger patterns than individual soldiers to disrupt their shape. At the same time, large patterns are more effective from afar, while small scale patterns work better <b>up</b> <b>close.</b> Traditional single scale patterns work well in their optimal range from the observer, but an observer at other distances will not see the pattern optimally. Nature itself is very often fractal, where plants and rock formations exhibit similar patterns across several magnitudes of scale. The idea behind multi-scale patterns is both to mimic the self-similarity of nature, and also to offer scale invariant or so-called fractal camouflage that works at close range {{as well as at}} traditional combat range.|$|E

5|$|Commander Alfred Godsal led {{the assault}} in HMS Brilliant {{and it was}} he who {{stumbled}} into the most effective German counter-measure first. As Brilliant staggered through the murk, the lookout spotted the buoy ahead and Godsal headed directly for it, coming under even heavier fire as he did so. Passing the navigation marker at speed, the cruiser was suddenly brought to a halt with a juddering lurch, throwing men to the decks and sticking fast in deep mud well outside the harbour mouth. Before warnings could be relayed to the Sirius following <b>up</b> <b>close</b> behind, she too passed the buoy and her captain Lieutenant-Commander Henry Hardy was shocked to see Brilliant dead ahead. With no time to manoeuvree, Sirius ploughed into the port quarter of Brilliant, the blockships settling into the mud in a tangle of wreckage.|$|E
5|$|Cotes' {{ship was}} fit only to sail with the wind, {{and the captain}} urged his men to make greater efforts to repair their ship before Uranie {{could come up with}} them again. So engrossed was the British crew with their repairs that it was not until 16:00 that it was {{realised}} that the French frigate was no longer holding station within sight, and had completely disappeared. This led some on the British ship to assume that Uranie had sunk, although in fact the ship had simply turned away {{in an effort to make}} it back to Rochefort to repair the damage suffered in the engagement. Also apparent were a number of sails in the distance. These rapidly approached and were revealed to be a frigate squadron flying the Union Flag. Cotes was unable to manoeuvre his ship or respond to the new arrivals, which were soon identified as French vessels wearing false flags. The leading frigate pulled <b>up</b> <b>close</b> to Thames and fired a broadside at the British frigate. Cotes immediately hailed the French, announcing that he was in no position to fight them due to the damage his ship had suffered and that he was striking his flag.|$|E
5|$|Features on Io {{are named}} after {{characters}} and places from the Io myth, {{as well as}} deities of fire, volcanoes, the Sun, and thunder from various myths, and characters and places from Dante's Inferno: names appropriate to the volcanic nature of the surface. Since the surface was first seen <b>up</b> <b>close</b> by Voyager 1, the International Astronomical Union has approved 225 names for Io's volcanoes, mountains, plateaus, and large albedo features. The approved feature categories used for Io for different types of volcanic features include patera ("saucer"; volcanic depression), fluctus ("flow"; lava flow), vallis ("valley"; lava channel), and active eruptive center (location where plume activity was {{the first sign of}} volcanic activity at a particular volcano). Named mountains, plateaus, layered terrain, and shield volcanoes include the terms mons, mensa ("table"), planum, and tholus ("rotunda"), respectively. Named, bright albedo regions use the term regio. Examples of named features are Prometheus, Pan Mensa, Tvashtar Paterae, and Tsũi Goab Fluctus.|$|E
