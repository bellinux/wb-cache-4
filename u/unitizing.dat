40|$|The {{current work}} generalizes the author's {{previous}} {{work on the}} infinite-dimensional Alpha Log-Determinant (Log-Det) divergences and Alpha-Beta Log-Det divergences, defined {{on the set of}} positive definite <b>unitized</b> trace class operators on a Hilbert space, to the entire Hilbert manifold of positive definite <b>unitized</b> Hilbert-Schmidt operators. This generalization is carried out via the introduction of the extended Hilbert-Carleman determinant for <b>unitized</b> Hilbert-Schmidt operators, in addition to the previously introduced extended Fredholm determinant for <b>unitized</b> trace class operators. The resulting parametrized family of Alpha-Beta Log-Det divergences is general and contains many divergences between positive definite <b>unitized</b> Hilbert-Schmidt operators as special cases, including the infinite-dimensional affine-invariant Riemannian distance and the infinite-dimensional generalization of the symmetric Stein divergence.

40|$|In {{the last}} couple of decades, the {{aerospace}} industry has been attracted by <b>unitized</b> structures for their potential of economic advantage in terms of low production cost and fuel efficiency from weight reduction due to a reduced number of parts and joints. In recent years, advanced manufacturing technologies, such as additive manufacturing processes and electron beam freeform fabrication, have boosted the feasibility of <b>unitized</b> structure manufacturing. As a result, <b>unitized</b> structures are increasingly becoming common in airframes as they displace conventional ubiquitous built-up structures. One concern with <b>unitized</b> structures is that they may not show the same resistance to fatigue as built-up structures in terms of crack growth rates. For a fatigue crack to cause failure of a built-up structure, it faces the problem of having to jump across the gaps between the different parts of the structure. Those gaps represent natural barriers that slow down crack-growth. However, a <b>unitized</b> structure will likely to have less stress raisers (e. g., fewer holes for fasteners). Hence, experimental as well as numerical analysis approaches are required to determine how a <b>unitized</b> structure compares to an equivalent built-up structure in terms of fatigue crack growth. This paper addresses finite element analysis of modelled <b>unitized</b> structure and equivalent built-up structure under amplitude loading for fatigue crack growth behavior...|$|R

50|$|Polypropylene strap (oriented or tensilized) is an {{economical}} material {{designed for}} light to medium duty <b>unitizing,</b> palletizing and bundling. It {{is available in}} various widths, thicknesses, and polymer variations (e.g., copolymers). Most polypropylene is embossed, some of which is also printed. This product offers higher elongation at break but tends to have irrecoverable dead stretch with constant stress.What is not generally known to end users is that polypropylene strapping will lose about 50% of the applied tension within one hour, and that this tension loss is accelerated with increases in ambient temperature, consequently although suitable for packs {{with a degree of}} stored energy that will take up any relaxtion that occurs in the strap, unacceptable strap slackness may occur after time if used on product that is 'Solid' such as bricks or concrete. Further more polypropylene strapping is susceptible to UV degradation and can quickly degrade if left outside exposed to the elements. The sensible choice of colour will retard the process, such as specifying black strap. Similarly, a UV inhibitor can be specified.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{longitudinal}} case {{study was to investigate}} the progressive development of <b>unitizing</b> in a cohort of students receiving reform-oriented mathematics instruction. One-on-one videotaped mathematics interviews were conducted twice annually for 4 years from Grade 1 to Grade 4 with a varying number of participants from 61 to 45 respectively. Multiplication and quotative division questions were analyzed for correctness, the physical model used to solve the problem, and the computation strategy used to solve the problem. Multiplication and adding up for division models that required the development of more sophisticated <b>unitizing</b> included modelling only one group, modelling just the groups, modelling the groups with the composite numeral, and modelling the new whole. Multiplication and adding up for division strategies that indicated the development of a <b>unitizing</b> structure included rhythmic counting, starting with a doublet, skip counting, regrouping to form a new composite, and splitting the composite and then iterating the sub-composites to find the total. The varying levels of simultaneity demonstrated by students were also noted as they pertain {{to the development of a}} <b>unitizing</b> structure.

40|$|The {{intention}} {{of the present study}} is to know how the pupils can learn to make a group of ten to understand the idea of <b>unitizing.</b> The pupils were given a contextual problem “Counting the Beads” in order to promote their understanding about the idea of <b>unitizing.</b> The process of designing the problem was based on the 5 tenets of Indonesian Realistic Mathematics Education (IRME). The methods of this study was a design research. The researcher designed the Hypothetical Learning Trajectory (HLT) before conducting the lesson in the classroom. The result of this study showed that the pupils learned to make a group of any number then moved to make a group of twenty before using the group of ten as a strategy in finding the amount of the beads.

40|$|The Annenberg Health Media Coding Project {{provides}} an ambitious forum for exploring notions of human coding validity, reliability, and replicability. Notably, the Project’s goal of making coding materials {{readily available to}} other researchers, providing full replicability, is a welcome contribution to the content analysis community.

Manifest versus latent content contrasts observed versus intended behaviors in content analysis. For each of the three issues, the paper presents a brief theoretical overview.
