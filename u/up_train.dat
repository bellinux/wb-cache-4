25|$|The station became {{unmanned}} from 1970. The station {{building was}} subsequently rebuilt and converted into apartments. The station exterior was clad in fiber cement {{in the hopes}} of eliminating maintenance. NSB considered closing the station in 1987 to speed <b>up</b> <b>train</b> times for travelers from further south, but the proposal never materialized. The station was largely left to decay and by the early 1990s was in poor condition. NSB then removed the fiber cement and renovated the building.|$|E
25|$|On May 25, 2013, in Chaffee, Missouri, a Union Pacific train {{collided}} with a BNSF train at a level junction. Seven people were injured. A total of 24 cars were derailed, including loaded autorack and scrap metal cars. Included in the crash were two Union Pacific engines. The accident caused an overpass to partially collapse, and a post-accident fire was also reported. The resulting investigation concluded the engineer most likely fell asleep, due to sleep apnea. In this incident, four progressively restrictive signals where violated, resulting in the <b>UP</b> <b>train</b> hitting the BNSF train at roughly 40 MPH. Total damages exceeded ten million dollars. The Missouri Route M bridge was reopened in August, 2013 with a new design.|$|E
25|$|Gatwick Airport {{railway station}} opened in June 1958. Initially the rail service was {{provided}} entirely by London to Brighton stopping services, but more trains {{began to call}} {{with the introduction of}} the summer timetable in June 1958. One of the key elements of this was the extension of Three Bridges to Bognor Regis stopping services to start and terminate at London Victoria. These trains would run through a reversible platform at Gatwick where a portion would detach and wait in the platform for passengers until the next <b>up</b> <b>train</b> from Bognor Regis was attached and the train would depart for Victoria. For this service British Rail used a small batch of seven Class 402 2HALs in order to work with the trains used on the Bognor Regis services, suitable for airport link use because of their larger luggage space.|$|E
