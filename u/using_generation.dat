5000|$|He {{said about}} the Khalka Mongols: [...] "The family was based on monogamous marriage. Polygyny occurred, but was very rare and countenanced only for reason of {{sterility}} in the first wife. ... Custom required {{that at least one}} of the man's sons should remain always with the parents to care for them in their old age and to inherit the core of the family's property; but other sons were generally given separate shares and their economic independence, plus the movable nature of the property itself, made it possible for them to leave their father's camp. ... The terms abaga and aca are used to express not only ascendant-descendant generational ranking, but also the relative seniority of two collateral lines. Where successive generations descend patrilineally from two brothers, the line from the elder brother is the senior line, and the line from the younger brother is the junior line. All successive generations in the senior line are senior to corresponding generations in the junior line, and are known collectively as the abagiin üye ("uncle" [...] generations); reciprocally, all generations in the junior line are known as the aciin üye ("nephew" [...] generations). Hence, persons in corresponding generations in two collateral lines refer to each other reciprocally as abaga aha/egci and aca hüu/hüuhen. Under these circumstances, relative age terms are not employed. That is, Ego cannot say abaga düu for an abaga cousin younger than himself, nor aca aha for an aca cousin older than himself. The reason for this is clear: the Khalka system distinguishes between paternal cousins solely on the basis of the relative seniority of the two brothers who head the collateral lines, and makes these distinctions by <b>using</b> <b>generation</b> terms (abaga, aca) instead of relative age terms (aha, düü). The relative age of two cousins is not considered in the reckoning. ... The terms üyeeld, hayaald, etc. are combined with the terms abaga and aca so that collateral kinsmen may be distinguished not only according to whether they are in ascendant or descendant generations, or of senior or junior rank, with respect to the speaker[...]. Where equality of age and generation tended to minimize reserve, seniority ranking tended to increase it - i.e. in the presence of one's age and generation equals, one was more reserved if they were of senior rank than if they were of equal rank. ... Younger siblings addressed elder siblings as aha or egci, and were in turn addressed by their personal names. If there were several elder siblings of same sex, the younger sibling generally addressed only the eldest as aha or egci, and the others by abgailana terms. ... Ordinarily, younger siblings did not call elder siblings by their personal names. ... An elder brother could punish a younger brother by striking him, and the younger brother was expected not to strike back if he was not of age. When he came of age, he could strike back with impunity. However, a family was criticized by outsiders if two brothers had a long-standing feud, and quarrels between siblings were considered worse than those between spouses. ... An elder brother couuld ask a younger brother to perform certain services for him - e.g. saddle his horse - but younger brothers did not expect the service to be reciprocated. ... When an elder brother assumed trusteeship of the family after the father's death, he did not merit from his brothers all the respect shown to the father by his sons. In such cases, younger brothers often fought with elder brothers over shares allotted to them at the time the property was finally divided; this is one of the reasons why fathers liked to divide property before their death".|$|E

40|$|Several {{methods for}} {{screening}} of newborns for Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) {{have been documented}} in the literature, which involve the quantitative assessment of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs), as a biomarker of naïve T-cell production. Most laboratories currently screening for SCID perform a DNA extraction from filter paper punches prior to real-time PCR amplification of TRECs; however, recently methods for in-situ amplification of DNA, without prior extraction, have been developed by the Newborn Screening and Molecular Biology Branch of the CDC. In collaboration with the CDC, the Oklahoma Newborn Screening Laboratory is validating a screening method for SCID that employs a single, 15 -minute wash of filter paper punches, without DNA extraction, prior to real-time PCR for quantitative measurement of TRECs. Blood spot punches are washed in 96 -well plates for 15 minutes with continuous shaking <b>using</b> <b>Generation</b> DNA Elution Solution 2 (Qiagen). The wash solution is then aspirated and PCR master mix is added directly to the wells containing the punches. The samples are amplified by real-time PCR using a Stratagene Mx 3005 P qPCR system. Analysis includes measurement of TRECs and a control gene (human RNase P protein p 30, RPP 30). Comparable results were obtained using this method relative to {{an earlier version of}} this in-situ real-time PCR procedure, which included two separate washes <b>using</b> <b>Generation</b> DNA Purification Solution 1 (Qiagen) followed b...|$|E
