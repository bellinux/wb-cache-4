40|$|This paper {{presents}} a cooperative strategy to achieve evenly spaced circular {{formation of a}} group of <b>unmanned</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The strategy is claimed to be fail-safe because the circular formation remains unaltered even if one or more <b>unmanned</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>vehicles</b> fail. We can also add more <b>unmanned</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>vehicles</b> without altering the formation. The control law uses only bearing angle information. We can pre-specify the centre of the circular formation of the <b>unmanned</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The <b>unmanned</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>vehicles</b> will maintain the desired distance from the centre with bearing angle measurement only. We assume that the <b>unmanned</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>vehicles</b> are identical and can measure the bearing angle of all the other <b>unmanned</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The strategy is analysed using unicycle kinematic and verified using six-degree-of-freedom model of the <b>unmanned</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Extensive simulations are carried out for noisy measurement, presence of wind and moving target...|$|R

5|$|Two Australian CH-47Ds were {{destroyed}} in Afghanistan. On 30 May 2011, A15-102 crashed in Zabul Province, {{resulting in the}} death of an Army <b>unmanned</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>vehicle</b> pilot who was travelling on board as a passenger. As it was impractical to recover the helicopter, it was destroyed by Coalition forces. The official inquiry into the crash found that it was caused by a known issue in which Chinooks suffered uncommanded pitch oscillations while flying through dense altitudes, and that the aircrew had not been adequately trained to prevent such incidents. A15-103 was written off following a hard landing in Kandahar Province on 22 June 2012, resulting in minor injuries to one of its aircrew. Both of the Chinooks at Kandahar International Airport in April 2013 also suffered significant damage when the airport was struck by a severe hail storm. Two ex-US Army CH-47Ds were purchased in December 2011 to replace A15-102, and arrived in Australia in January 2012.|$|E

40|$|A {{cooperative}} line-of-sight {{guidance law}} for a three-dimensional phantom track generation using <b>unmanned</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>vehicles</b> Il-Hyoung Lee and Hyochoong Bang A cooperative guidance law {{for a team}} of <b>unmanned</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>vehicles</b> is addressed to deceive air defense radar networks by generating a so-called phantom track. The problem {{is viewed as a}} line of sight guidance problem in which <b>unmanned</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>vehicles</b> track the line of sight of a phantom. A guidance law based on input–output feedback linearization is developed {{in order to deal with}} a situation in which the phantom condition is not satisfied. The resultant solution is obtained in a feedback form. Since the system is over-actuated, a control allocation optimization problem is formulated and solved by adding an additional objective term to the cost function that forces <b>unmanned</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>vehicles</b> to fly parallel to the phantom using a predictive control method. A closed-form solution is constructed for the <b>unmanned</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>vehicles</b> trajectory corresponding to the pre-specified phantom track. The proposed method is expanded through a scenario in which multiple <b>unmanned</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>vehicles</b> cooperatively generate a coherent phantom track toward a desired waypoint by engaging with the same number of radars. The performance of the proposed guidance law is demonstrated through a simulation study...|$|R
5|$|During the 1980s these battleships {{made use}} of the RQ-2 Pioneer, an <b>unmanned</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{employed}} in spotting for the guns. Launched from the fantail using a rocket-assist booster that was discarded shortly after takeoff, the Pioneer carried a video camera in a pod under {{the belly of the}} aircraft which transmitted live video to the ship so operators could observe enemy actions or fall of shot during naval gunnery. To land the UAV a large net was deployed {{at the back of the}} ship; the aircraft was flown into it. Missouri and Wisconsin both used the Pioneer UAVs successfully during Operation Desert Storm, and in one particularly memorable incident, a Pioneer UAV operated by Wisconsin received the surrender of Iraqi troops during combat operations. This particular Pioneer was later donated to the Smithsonian Institution, and is now on public display. During Operation Desert Storm these Pioneers were operated by detachments of VC-6. In addition to the Pioneer UAVs, the recommissioned Iowas could support six types of helicopters: the Sikorsky HO3S-1, UH-1 Iroquois, SH-2 Seasprites, CH-46 Sea Knight, CH-53 Sea Stallion and the LAMPS III SH-60B Seahawk.|$|E
5|$|Iowa {{was then}} towed to Ingalls Shipbuilding, Pascagoula, Mississippi, where {{over the next}} several months the {{battleship}} was upgraded with the most advanced weaponry available. Among the new weapons systems installed were four MK 141 quad cell launchers for 16 AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, eight Armored Box Launcher mounts for 32 BGM-109 Tomahawk missiles, and a quartet of Phalanx Close-in weapon system Gatling guns for defense against enemy anti-ship missiles and enemy aircraft. Iowa was the first battleship to receive the RQ-2 Pioneer <b>Unmanned</b> <b>Aerial</b> <b>Vehicle.</b> She could carry up to eight of the remotely controlled drones, which replaced the helicopters previously used to spot for her nine 16inch (410mm)/50 cal Mark 7 guns. Also included in her modernization were upgrades to radar and fire-control systems for her guns and missiles, and improved electronic warfare capabilities. Armed as such, Iowa was formally recommissioned on 28 April 1984, ahead of schedule, within her budget at a cost of $500million, and under the command of Captain Gerald E. Gneckow. In order to expedite the schedule, many necessary repairs to Iowa engines and guns were not completed and the mandatory Navy Board of Inspection and Survey (InSurv) inspection was skipped.|$|E
5|$|Formerly {{known as}} AH-64D Block III, in 2012, it was redesignated as AH-64E Guardian to {{represent}} its increased capabilities. The AH-64E features improved digital connectivity, the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System, more powerful T700-GE-701D engines with upgraded face gear transmission to accommodate more power, capability to control <b>unmanned</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>vehicle</b> (UAVs), full IFR capability, and improved landing gear. New composite rotor blades, which successfully completed testing in 2004, increase cruise speed, climb rate, and payload capacity. Deliveries began in November 2011. Full-rate production was approved on 24 October 2012, with 634 AH-64Ds to be upgraded to AH-64E standard {{and production of}} 56 new-build AH-64Es to start in 2019/20. Changes in production lots 4 through 6 shall include a cognitive decision aiding system and new self-diagnostic abilities. The updated Longbow radar has an oversea capacity, potentially enabling naval strikes; an AESA radar is under consideration. The E model is to be fit for maritime operations. The Army has {{expressed a desire to}} add extended-range fuel tanks to the AH-64E to further increase range and endurance. AH-64Es are to have the L-3 Communications MUM-TX datalink installed in place of two previous counterparts, communicating on C, D, L, and Ku frequency bands to transmit and receive data and video with all Army UAVs. Lots 5 and 6 will be equipped with Link 16 data-links.|$|E
