50|$|The <b>utility</b> model <b>certificate</b> {{is similar}} to a patent {{application}} but with less stringent procedures of application and shorter duration. The requirement needed for a <b>utility</b> model <b>certificate</b> is that it should be new and have industrial applicability. A <b>utility</b> model <b>certificate</b> expires after seven years of application without the possibility of a renewal. An application for patent can be converted to one for a <b>utility</b> model <b>certificate</b> and vice versa if prior to the grant or refusal of the application the prescribed fee for the latter is paid.|$|R
50|$|The Strasbourg Agreement Concerning the International Patent Classification (or IPC), {{also known}} as the IPC Agreement, was signed in Strasbourg, France, on March 24, 1971 and entered into force on October 7, 1975. It {{establishes}} a common classification for patents for invention, inventors’ <b>certificates,</b> <b>utility</b> models and <b>utility</b> <b>certificates,</b> known as the “International Patent Classification” (IPC). The Agreement was amended on September 28, 1979.|$|R

He served as music director of CJAY-TV, and was concertmaster and assistant conductor of the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra from 1942 to 1957.

50|$|This part {{provides}} that {{an application for}} a patent or a change in ownership of a patent application if any should be in writing. Such application or change in ownership of an application should be recorded and published by the registrar before it can have effect against a third party.

It {{was one of three}} private power {{companies}} that had water power leases with the Niagara Parks Commission, but {{was the only one that}} was financed with Canadian capital. The company built the Toronto Power Generating Station at Niagara Falls beginning in 1906, and the power house was completed in 1913. During the construction, there was much debate about whether the utility should remain privately operated or become a public utility.

50|$|This part {{talks about}} any {{international}} application for patent designating Ghana whereby such an application shall {{be treated as}} a patent application or a <b>utility</b> model <b>certificate</b> filed under this Act with the filing date as the international filing date under the treaty. There shall be a patent office which shall act as the receiving, designated and elected office in respect of any international application involving Ghana or a resident or a national of Ghana. The international application shall be filed with the Patent Office in a prescribed language and a prescribed transmittal fee. The Patent Office shall not commence the processing of an international application designating Ghana before the expiration of the time limit except if the applicant complies with certain requirements and files with the Patent Office an express request for early commencement of the processing. The effect of failure to comply with the requirements within the time limit is that, the application shall be deemed withdrawn. The regulation or treaty governing an international application for patent designating Ghana is the Harare Protocol. The international application shall be processed by the Patent Office in accordance with the treaty and the regulation made under the treaty and where there are any conflicting views with the Act, the Treaty, the regulation made under the treaty and the administrative instructions shall prevail.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFinancial or {{tangible}} {{incentives are}} {{a strategy for}} improving health behaviours. The mechanisms of action of incentives are complex and debated. Using a multidisciplinary integrated mixed methods study, with service-user collaboration throughout, we developed a typology of incentives and their meanings for initiating and sustaining smoking cessation in pregnancy and breastfeeding. The ultimate aim was to inform incentive intervention design by providing insights into incentive acceptability and mechanisms of action. Systematic evidence syntheses of incentive intervention studies for smoking cessation in pregnancy or breastfeeding identified incentive characteristics, which were developed into initial categories. Little published qualitative data on user perspectives and acceptability was available. Qualitative interviews and focus groups conducted in three UK regions with a diverse socio-demographic sample of 88 women and significant others from the target population, 53 service providers, 24 experts/decision makers, and conference attendees identified new potential incentives and providers, with and without experience of incentives. Identified incentives (published and emergent) were classified into eight categories: cash and shopping vouchers, maternal wellbeing, baby and pregnancy-related, behaviour-related, health-related, general <b>utility,</b> awards and <b>certificates,</b> and experiences. A typology was refined iteratively through concurrent data collection and thematic analysis to explore participants' understandings of ‘incentives’ and to compare and contrast meanings across types. Our typology can be understood in three dimensions: the degree of restriction, {{the extent to which}} each is hedonic and/or utilitarian, and whether each has solely monetary value versus monetary with added social value. The layers of autonomy, meanings and the social value of incentive types influence their acceptability and interact with structural, social, and personal factors. Dimensions of incentive meaning that go beyond the simple incentive description should inform incentive programme design and are likely to influence outcomes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the lobbying strategies {{employed by the}} German energy industries in the process leading up to EU's Renewable Energy Directive. The {{focus is on the}} most controversial part of it: Choice of support mechanisms for increasing production of renewable energy in Europe. The position on this issue roughly divided the energy industry into two sectors: the <b>utilities,</b> favoring green <b>certificates</b> and other supranational incentives and the renewables industry, promoting feed-in tariffs. Nine interest organizations, five German and four at the European level, serve as cases. Expectations based on the two theoretical perspectives liberal intergovernmentalism (LI) and multi-level governance (MLG) are formulated and tested against the empirics in a most likely case design. In addition, resources, mainly in terms of manpower, are assessed as a conditioning factor for choice of lobbying strategies. The findings show that the observations provide more support for the multi-level perspective, MLG, than for liberal intergovernmentalism, LI. Two findings supported the LI perspective: 1) All the German interest organizations put top priority at lobbying the German government. 2) The interest organizations provided German decision makers with crucial information. As envisioned by the MLG-perspective, there was a clear division of work between the organizations at the two political levels. Further, the lobbying activity displayed several multi-level characteristics. First, all the German interest organizations lobbied both at the national and at the European level. Second, the national interest organizations participated in multi-level political coalitions, in particular the renewables industry. There, they coordinated their political positions, pooled resources, shared information and made common strategies. Third, all the European-level interest organizations lobbied both the core EU institutions and national governments. Fourth, their information strategy matched the Commission's need for critical information on the complicated issues involved. It might be expected that interest groups loosing at home could try to “by-pass” national politics by lobbying extra much at the European level, but the observations are inconclusive in this respect. That more resources were associated with a higher number of lobbying channels was true at the European level, but not nationally. The number of political channels used by the German interest organizations rather depended on level of political mobilization and creating of broad coalitions...|$|R
