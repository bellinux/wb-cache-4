500|$|At {{the start}} of the 1987 regular season, Wiggins spent some time as a {{designated}} hitter (DH) and shared second base duties with Burleson. Rookie second baseman Billy Ripken joined the club on July 10. Burleson was cut, but general manager Hank Peters said, [...] "We're not bringing [...] <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> sit on the bench." [...] Wiggins was hitting [...]242 on July 10, and he played mostly DH after the rookie's arrival. In early August, Wiggins received a three-day suspension after he got into an altercation with teammate Jim Dwyer and grabbed the shirt of Ripken Sr.|$|E
500|$|In {{the liner}} notes to the 2003 remastered {{version of the}} album, lead singer Ian McCulloch said that he {{constantly}} had the American rock band The Velvet Underground's song [...] "What Goes On" [...] {{in the back of}} his mind. He also stated that the band wanted to record a soul album. In the same liner notes, bassist Les Pattinson said that the band was often lazy and hence had hired rehearsal space at the Ministry in Liverpool. He said this made them work harder and develop [...] "language" [...] in the rhythm. According to guitarist Will Sergeant, McCulloch considers Heaven <b>Up</b> <b>Here</b> <b>to</b> be Sergeant's album because he was bossy and a control freak during the recording.|$|E
500|$|Johnson said Adolf {{previously}} made {{comments about}} killing any African American {{who ran for}} president: [...] "He made a comment in the past. I can't honestly tell you how long ago in the past, that he didn't believe a black should be {{the leader of this}} country." [...] According to Johnson, Adolf said he was already wanted for other crimes, so it [...] "wouldn't matter if he killed Obama". Johnson also claimed Adolf said he would never be taken alive and wanted to [...] "go down in a blaze of glory". Law enforcement sources told KCNC-TV that one of the suspects [...] "was directly asked if they had come to Denver to kill Obama. He responded in the affirmative." [...] Johnson said Gartrell came to Denver to help Adolf execute the plan, and Gartrell later admitted to police that in talking about Obama, they referred to [...] "shooting on a grassy knoll," [...] a reference to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. An arrest warrant read, [...] "Adolf said that he wanted to kill Obama and additionally stated that he would specifically use a sniper rifle and high powered scope, and find high ground to set up and shoot Obama." [...] However, Johnson also told the reporter he {{came to the conclusion that}} there was assassination plot only after being questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation multiple times, adding, “I told them I had no idea there was a plot, a plan, a conspiracy or anything like that ... When the feds came and laid out everything on the table and how it looked, I was in agreement that they could have been <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> do something like that." [...] Johnson later rejected additional media interview requests.|$|E

2500|$|A {{siege of}} Khartoum by the Mahdist forces {{commanded}} by the Mahdi himself started on 18 March 1884. Initially, {{the siege of}} Khartoum was more in nature a blockade rather than a true siege as the Mahdi's forces lacked the strength to wage a proper siege, for example only cutting the telegraphy lines in April 1884. The British had decided to abandon the Sudan, {{but it was clear}} that Gordon had other plans, and the public increasingly called for a relief expedition. Gordon's last telegrams were clearly meant for the British public with one message addressed to Baring reading: [...] "You state your intention of not sending any relief force <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> Berber...I shall hold on here as long as I can, and if I can suppress the rebellion, I shall do so. If I cannot, I shall retire to the Equator and leave you with the indelible disgrace of abandoning the garrisons".|$|E
