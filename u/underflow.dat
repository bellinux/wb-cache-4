5|$|About 92% of Bahrain is desert with {{periodic}} droughts {{and dust}} storms, the main natural hazards for Bahrainis. Environmental issues facing Bahrain include desertification {{resulting from the}} degradation of limited arable land, coastal degradation (damage to coastlines, coral reefs, and sea vegetation) resulting from oil spills and other discharges from large tankers, oil refineries, distribution stations, and illegal land reclamation at places such as Tubli Bay. The agricultural and domestic sectors' over-utilisation of the Dammam Aquifer, the principal aquifer in Bahrain, has led to its salinisation by adjacent brackish and saline water bodies. A hydrochemical study identified {{the locations of the}} sources of aquifer salinisation and delineated their areas of influence. The investigation indicates that the aquifer water quality is significantly modified as groundwater flows from the northwestern parts of Bahrain, where the aquifer receives its water by lateral <b>underflow</b> from eastern Saudi Arabia, to the southern and southeastern parts. Four types of salinisation of the aquifer are identified: brackish-water up-flow from the underlying brackish-water zones in north-central, western, and eastern regions; seawater intrusion in the eastern region; intrusion of sabkha water in the southwestern region; and irrigation return flow in a local area in the western region. Four alternatives for the management of groundwater quality that are available to the water authorities in Bahrain are discussed and their priority areas are proposed, based on the type and extent of each salinisation source, in addition to groundwater use in that area.|$|E

The main goal of this investigation is to understand the propagation dynamics of fluid mud <b>underflows</b> that depends upon a number of factors, including: concentrations, rheological properties and released configurations of fluid mud. Laboratory experiments were conducted with different initial fluid mud concentrations in three different experimental set-ups: rectangular flume for constant volume release, rectangular flume for constant flux release, and a square pool for radial constant flux release of fluid mud. The experiments in the rectangular flume generated two-dimensional <b>underflows.</b> The experiments in the pool simulated typical open water pipeline disposal operations with submerged vertical discharge configuration in the field and radially axisymmetric three-dimensional fluid mud <b>underflows</b> were generated in these experiments. As expected, constant volume release experiments generated gravity currents that exhibit slumping, inertial and viscous propagation phases while constan...|$|R

Notice that deletion operations require s cooperating siblings, while insertion operations require s - 1 siblings.|$|R
25|$|An {{operation}} can {{be legal}} in principle, {{but the result}} can be impossible to represent in the specified format, because the exponent is too large or too small to encode in the exponent field.

40|$|The PCnet-FAST {{controller}} {{is designed}} with a flexible FIFO-SRAM buffer architecture to handle traffic in half-duplex and full-duplex 100 -Mbps Ethernet networks. This buffer architecture provides high performance by keeping overflows and <b>underflows</b> {{to a minimum}} for various system and network environments. In window-based protocol schemes like TCP and IPX, overflows and <b>underflows</b> are particularly expensive since the missed frame involves retransmission of that particular frame (or more frames within the window), resulting in a reduced overall network and system throughput. The following study indicates a need for large buffers to avoid costly <b>underflows</b> and overflows in these environments. APPROACH A system-level model of the PCnet-FAST buffer architecture was developed using a modeling tool called Workbench from SES [ref. 1]. Workbench provides the ability to model complex queuing systems in a detailed fashion.

Additionally, JSON says nothing about the treatment of signed zeros: whether 0.0 is distinct from -0.0.

The magnitude of the work they perform in sedimentation may have been obscured somewhat in recent years because there has been a tendency to think of density-currents almost solely as turbid <b>underflows</b> in bodies of still water, especially in reservoirs that are fed by muddy rivers. Density-currents are not limited to <b>underflows,</b> be they turbid or otherwise. Their occurrence is confined neither to reservoirs in particular nor to bodies of water in general. For example, dust storms usually are true density-currents [see 1 of "References" at end of paper]. The importance of the atmosphere as a transporting and sorting agent is well known, and has been demonstrated clearly by evidence gathered by JOHAN AUGUST UDDEN[2], EDWARD ELWAY FREE[3], and many others. The fact that needs wider recognition is that the atmospheric transportation of sediment is accomplished very largely by density-currents...|$|R

For example, the effective resistance of n resistors in parallel (see fig. 1) is given by [...] If a short-circuit develops with [...] set to 0, [...] will return +infinity which will give a final [...] of 0, as expected (see the continued fraction example of [...] for another example).|$|E
