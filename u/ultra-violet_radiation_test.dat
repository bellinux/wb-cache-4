Under the same conditions, animals inoculated with T. pallidum and exposed to ultra-violet light maintained a lower weight than the corresponding control groups living in total darkness. Furthermore, the mortality rate from pneumonic infection {{was found to be}} greater in animals exposed to <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>radiation</b> than in those living entirely in the dark.

40|$|Abstract Background Of {{the eight}} human herpes viruses, varicella-zoster virus, which causes {{chickenpox}} and zoster, {{has a unique}} epidemiology. Primary infection is much less common in children in the tropics compared with temperate areas. This results in increased adult susceptibility causing outbreaks, for example in health-care workers migrating from tropical to temperate countries. The recent demonstration that there are different genotypes of varicella-zoster virus and their geographic segregation into tropical and temperate areas suggests a distinct, yet previously unconsidered climatic factor {{may be responsible for}} both the clinical and molecular epidemiological features of this virus infection. Presentation of the hypothesis Unlike other human herpes viruses, varicella-zoster virus does not require intimate contact for infection to occur indicating that transmission may be interrupted by a geographically restricted climatic factor. The factor with the largest difference between tropical and temperate zones is <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>radiation.</b> This could reduce the infectiousness of chickenpox cases by inactivating virus in vesicles, before or after rupture. This would explain decreased transmissibility in the tropics and why the peak chickenpox incidence in temperate zones occurs during winter and spring, when <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>radiation</b> is at its lowest. The evolution of geographically restricted genotypes is also explained by <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>radiation</b> driving natural selection of different virus genotypes with varying degrees of resistance to inactivation, tropical genotypes being the most resistant. Consequently, temperate viruses should be more sensitive to its effects. This is supported by the observation that temperate genotypes are found in the tropics only in specific circumstances, namely where <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>radiation</b> has either been excluded or significantly reduced in intensity. Testing the Hypothesis The hypothesis is testable by exposing different virus genotypes to <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>radiation</b> and quantifying virus survival by plaque forming units or quantitative mRNA RT-PCR. Implications of the hypothesis The ancestral varicella-zoster virus, most probably a tropical genotype, co-migrated with man as he left Africa approximately 200, 000 years ago. For this virus to have lost the selective advantage of resistance to <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>radiation,</b> the hypothesis would predict that the temperate, ultra-violet sensitive virus should have acquired another selective advantage as an evolutionary trade-off. One obvious advantage could be an increased reactivation rate as zoster to set up more rounds of chickenpox transmission. If this were so, the mechanism responsible for resistance to <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>radiation</b> might also be involved in reactivation and latency. This could then provide the first insight into a genetic correlate of the survival strategy of this virus. </p...|$|R

25|$|One of most {{important}} achievements of ISRO {{in this field}} was the discovery of three species of bacteria in the upper stratosphere {{at an altitude of}} between 20–40 km. The bacteria, highly resistant to <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>radiation,</b> are not found elsewhere on Earth, leading to speculation on whether they are extraterrestrial in origin. These three bacteria can be considered to be extremophiles. Until then, the upper stratosphere was believed to be inhospitable because of the high doses of <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>radiation.</b> The bacteria were named as Bacillus isronensis in recognition of ISRO's contribution in the balloon experiments, which led to its discovery, Bacillus aryabhata after India's celebrated ancient astronomer Aryabhata and Janibacter hoylei after the distinguished astrophysicist Fred Hoyle.|$|R

40|$|Modeling and {{observations}} {{provide evidence of}} the existence of a tertiary ozone maximum in the middle mesosphere restricted to winter high-latitudes. This local maximum occurs at approximately 72 km altitude, at latitudes just equatorward of the polar night terminator.

In the middle mesosphere, at high latitudes, the atmosphere becomes optically thick to <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>radiation</b> at wavelengths below 185 nm. Since photolysis of water vapor is the primary source of odd-hydrogen, reduced <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>radiation</b> results in less odd-hydrogen and consequently lower oxygen loss rates.

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringIn this {{research}} project, a nanocomposite coating was developed using multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) associated with epoxy primer {{in order to}} increase coating resistance against <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>radiation</b> and corrosion. The effectiveness of this nanocomposite coating was evaluated by exposing it to ultra-violet light for different time period. To determine hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics of the different UV exposed coated surface, the water contact angle was measured on the surfaces. The UV degraded samples were also exposed to the salt fog corrosion chamber for 80 days. The coating performance tests were carried out using digital images, optical microscope, atomic force microscope (AFM) and thickness measurement. It was found that the addition of multiwall carbon nanotubes into the coating materials drastically increased the coating resistance against <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>radiation</b> and corrosion.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 52 - 56) This research {{presents the}} low strain-rate mechanical properties of polyurea {{as a function}} of <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure duration. Polyurea samples were casted and continuously exposed to <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>radiation</b> for 15 weeks to simulate ~ 9200 hours of direct sunlight exposure. Each sample (unexposed and exposed) was tested uniaxially with quasi-static tension per ASTM D 638 - 8. Stress-Strain data were used to calculate polyurea???s elastic modulus, 0. 2 % offset yield stress, shear modulus and stress at 250 % strain. In addition, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) and scanning electron spectroscopy (SEM) was conducted to study the change in the optical properties and surface topology of polyurea, respectively. Finally, the stress-Strain data were fitted into Ogden???s hyperelasticity model. A change in the Ogden???s fitting parameters is attributed to the ultra-violet exposure duration. The elastic modulus was found to increase by 23. 89 % (90. 15 MPa to 11. 68 MPa), while the 0. 2 % offset yield stress decreased by 15. 78 % (2. 46 MPa to 2. 07 MPa) ...|$|R

40|$|Possible {{variation}} in the probability that absorbed quanta of ultra-violet energy will produce observable inhibitory and lethal effects in the yeast cell, due to non-uniformity in sensitivity of the {{different regions of the}} cell, may be further modified by the reproductive stage of the cell at the time of irradiation.

The radical-pair, however, is not simply two radicals. This is because radical-pairs (specifically singlets) are quantum entangled, even as separate molecules.

Therefore, spin states can be altered by magnetic fields.|$|R
