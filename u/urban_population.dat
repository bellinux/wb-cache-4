40|$|Urbanization and {{domestication}} share {{features in}} terms of characters that are favored by selection. These include loss of fear of humans, reduced corticosterone levels, prolonged breeding seasons, and several others. Here, I test the hypothesis that urbanization results from differential colonization of urban areas by species with heterogeneous levels of fear in the ancestral rural populations, followed by a reduction in variance in fear responses with a subsequent increase in diversity of fear responses as <b>urban</b> <b>populations</b> become adapted to the urban environment. Using information on variance in flight initiation distances (FIDs) when approached by a human, I show that rural populations of birds characterized by short mean flight distances and large variances in flight distances differentially colonized urban areas. As a consequence of this <b>urban</b> invasion, <b>urban</b> <b>populations</b> lost variation in FID. The variance in FID was initially larger in rural than in <b>urban</b> <b>populations</b> but eventually became larger in <b>urban</b> <b>populations</b> with time since urbanization. This secondary increase in variance in FID of <b>urban</b> <b>populations</b> was associated {{with an increase in}} <b>population</b> density of <b>urban</b> <b>populations,</b> suggesting that as birds became adapted to urban areas, they secondarily gained variance in behavioral flexibility.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{revealed}} differences between {{urban and rural}} vocalizations of numerous bird species. These differences include frequency shifts, amplitude shifts, altered song speed, and selective meme use. If particular memes sung by <b>urban</b> <b>populations</b> are adapted to the urban soundscape, "urban-typical" calls, memes, or repertoires should be consistently used in multiple <b>urban</b> <b>populations</b> of the same species, regardless of geographic location. We tested whether songs or contact calls of silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis) might be subject to such convergent cultural evolution by comparing syllable repertoires of geographically dispersed <b>urban</b> and rural <b>population</b> pairs throughout southeastern Australia. Despite frequency and tempo differences between urban and rural calls, call repertoires were similar between habitat types. However, certain song syllables were used more frequently by birds from <b>urban</b> than rural <b>populations.</b> Partial redundancy analysis revealed that both geographic location and habitat characteristics were important predictors of syllable repertoire composition. These findings suggest convergent cultural evolution: <b>urban</b> <b>populations</b> modify both song and call syllables from their local repertoire in response to noise. © 2012 The Authors.
