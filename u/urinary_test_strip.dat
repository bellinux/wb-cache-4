The analytical performance of the instrument with regard to imprecision, linearity, detection limit, drift, carry-over and method comparison was studied. Using the Aution stick 8 <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> the pH, glucose, protein, ketones, bilirubin, blood, urobilinogen and leukocyte esterase were analysed. Specific gravity measurements were performed by refractive index method. Within-run and between-run imprecision determined at three levels of analyte were good. No carry-over was observed. Obtained results were linear through all the described analytical range. No significant drift was detected. Method comparison with some quantitative methods was performed and showed a good correlation with most of the analytes. The study of interferences showed minor interferences by common therapeutic drugs with the measurement of some analytes.

40|$|Prompt {{detection}} of renal involvement through evaluation of microalbuminuria can both reduce mortality in diabetic patients and {{significantly reduce the}} cost of managing these patients. To this end, Micral <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> have been used as a screeing tool in this group of patients though not yet in our country. The present study aimed to evaluate this test and to abtain a simpler and less expensive method of screening for microlbuminuria. In this study, 200 type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients referred to the Endocrine & Metabolims Research Center of the Tehran university of medical Sciences were evaluated for microabluminuria. Entry criteria consisted of a history of recognized diabetes longer than or equal to 5 years. Exclusion criteria included development of urinary tract infection, pyrexia, and a history of uncontrolled hypertension. Every patient first completed a data questionnaire and then provided a first-void urine sample, which was tested for microalbuminuria with a <b>urinary</b> protein <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> (an Iranian-made Uri-Yab and a German-made BM-test-GP strip) and the sulphasalicylic acid chemical method. Negative samples were tested further using Micral <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> (based on gold-lable immunochromatograpy) and the microalbumin measurement kit manufactured by Dako. Germany (based on turbidometry using a Hitachi autoanalyser). 126 women and 74 men were recruited into the study. The average age of the sample was 40. 7 years (range= 16 to 63 years); 17 patients had IDDM and 173, NIDDM. Average duration of recognized diabetes was 8. 75 years. Based on results obtained using chemical analysis and foreign-made <b>tests</b> <b>strips,</b> 46 patients (23 %) had macroalbuminuria, though the detection rate using Iranian-made <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> was 18 percent (36 patients). A further 16. 2 percent of patients had microalbuminuria, with an average urinary albumin excertion of 28. 7 mg per liter. Compared with colorimetric methos, the Micral test yieled a sensitivity of 93 % and a specificity of 87 percenct. Furthermore, the negative predictive value of the Micral test was 0. 92, compared with a figure of 0. 94 for a combination of the sulphasalicylic acid method and the BM-Test-GP strips. The results we obtained for the Micral test as a screening tool concurs with the results of numerous other studies. Diurnal variations in albumin excretion dicatate the performance of screening tests on three different occasions at specified regular intervals. Given the relatively high cost of Micral strips, it seems that a simpler and less expensive method should be devised for our country. We observed a higher negative predictive value for the combined suluphasalicylic+BM-Test-GP method than for the Micral strips. The cost of the latter combination comes to 2, 000 Rials (@ 0. 25 USS), which is easily affordable for most patients; the methodology falls comfortably within the experits of medical diagnostic laboratories in Iran.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{healthcare}} expenditure on self-monitoring {{of blood}} glucose (SMBG) <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> under the Nova Scotia Seniors' Pharmacare Program (NSSPP) has increased significantly in recent years. The {{objective of this}} study was to identify the frequency and cost of claims for blood glucose monitoring <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> by NSSPP beneficiaries in the fiscal year 2005 / 06 and to explore the variation in the use of <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> by type of treatment, age and sex. Methods Retrospective analysis was conducted using pharmacy administrative claims data for NSSPP beneficiaries. Study subjects were aged ≥ 65 years on October 1, 2004, received SMBG <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> in the 110 days prior to April 1, 2005, and were alive throughout the twelve month study period. Subjects were categorized into four groups: insulin only, oral antihyperglycemic agents (OAA) only, both OAA and insulin; and no reimbursed diabetes medications. Statistical analysis was performed to identify differences in expenditure by medication group and in frequency of SMBG <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> claimed by medication group, age, and sex. Results Of 13, 564 included beneficiaries, 13. 2 % were categorized as insulin only, 53. 5 % OAA only, 7. 2 % both OAA and insulin, and 26. 0 % no reimbursed diabetes medications. Over half (58. 7 %) were femle. The insulin only category had the highest mean (± SD) number of SMBG <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> claimed per day (2. 0 ± 1. 5) with a mean annual total cost of $ 615 ± $ 441 /beneficiary. Beneficiaries aged 80 years and above claimed fewer <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> than beneficiaries below 80 years. Conclusion This population based study shows that in Nova Scotia the SMBG <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> claimed by the majority of seniors were within Canadian guidelines. However, a small proportion of beneficiaries claimed for SMBG <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> infrequently or too frequently, which suggests areas for improvement. The provincial drug plan covers the majority of the costs of <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> utilization, suggesting that the majority of <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> claimed did not exceed the maximum allowable cost (MAC) established in the program's MAC policy. Drug insurance programs need to work with healthcare providers to determine if patients are using <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> optimally; and to determine their impact on patient outcomes. In addition, they need to determine the cost-effectiveness of their SMBG <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> reimbursement policies. </p...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{reports the}} use of electrospun nanofibres as a {{platform}} {{for the development of}} colorimetric probes. Three colorimetric probes in the form of electrospun nanofibre <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> were developed for the selective detection of ascorbic acid and dopamine because they are crucial biomolecules for physiological processes in human metabolism and usually coexist in biological samples. The simultaneous detection of the biomolecules is very important as their abnormal concentration levels would lead to diseases such as Parkinson's and schizophrenia. Different methods of incorporating detector agents into the nanofibre were exploited for the detection of the biomolecules. The methods included physical incorporation of nanoparticles, covalent bonding of ligand/dyes through surface modification of the fibres. The first colorimetric <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> for ascorbic acid was based on copper-gold alloy nanoparticles prepared in-situ and hosted in nylon 6. The <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> showed selectivity in detecting ascorbic acid in the pH range 2 – 7. The suitability of fibres in hosting copper-gold alloy nanoparticles for the colorimetric detection of ascorbic acid was investigated using nylon 6, poly(vinyl benzyl chloride) -styrene and cellulose acetate based <b>test</b> <b>strips.</b> All the <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> exhibited leaching and the nylon 6 based <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> was found to be thermally stable up to 60 ˚C. The colorimetric performance of the <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> was maintained and neither was colour decay exhibited after 10 months of storage in a shelf. The <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> achieved an eye-ball limit of detection of 1. 76 x 10 - 2 mg L- 1 and its suitability was demonstrated by the determination of ascorbic acid in fruit juices, urine, serum, and vitamin C tablets. The second colorimetric <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> for ascorbic acid and dopamine employed prussian blue synthesised in-situ in nylon 6. Ascorbic acid turned the deep blue <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> to light blue at pH 3, and a faded navy blue colour at a pH range of 6 - 7 while dopamine changed the strip to purple at the same pH range. The versatility of the <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> was demonstrated by detecting ascorbic acid in commercial fruit juices as well as by detecting ascorbic acid as well as dopamine in fortified urine. The eye-ball detection limit of the Prussian blue <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> for ascorbic acid and dopamine was 17. 6 mg L- 1 and 18. 9 mg L- 1, respectively. The third method involved a covalent approach, where poly(vinylbenzyl chloride) nanofibers were post functionalised with 2 -(2 ′-pyridyl) -imidazole and iron(III) for the selective detection of ascorbic acid and dopamine. The eye-ball detection limit for ascorbic acid and dopamine was 17. 6 mg L- 1 and 18. 9 mg L- 1, respectively. The <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> was selective for dopamine, but the detection of ascorbic acid suffered from interference by glutathione. The application of the <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> was nevertheless demonstrated by the detection of ascorbic acid in fruit juices and dopamine in fortified urine.

By utilizing glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase in the core-phase solution, and a chromogenic agent either in the core solution (in which case 2, 2 &# 39;-azinobis-(3 -ethylbenzthiazoline- 6 -sulphonate) (ABTS) was used) or in the shell-phase solution (in which case o-dianisidine was used) for co-axial electrospinning, in situ co-encapsulation of the two enzymes within the hollow nano-chamber and incorporation of chromogenic agents either inside the nano-chamber or in the shell of the hollow nanofibers was realized. Such unique "all-in-one" feature enabled the prepared hollow nanofiber membrane-based <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> to be applied either as colorimetric sensors in solution or as an optical biosensor operated in the "dip-and-read" mode.
