India's western coast, bordering the more placid Arabian Sea, experiences cyclones only rarely; these mainly strike Gujarat and, less frequently, Kerala.|$|E
5|$|Several {{clusters}} of thunderstorms {{developed during the}} morning from eastern Nebraska across Iowa into Illinois, taking place along a warm front. The front remained over the same areas during the day, as daytime heating and southwesterly surface winds brought warm and <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> northward, resulting in severe weather development. The presence of strong winds aloft aided in development of multiple clusters and lines of thunderstorms that produced damaging wind, hail and tornadoes across Missouri, Illinois and Indiana.|$|E
5|$|The Storm Prediction Center {{issued a}} {{moderate}} risk for severe weather across western Kansas and small portions of Oklahoma, Colorado and Nebraska for May 4, while temperatures {{were in the}} mid to high 80s°F (near 30°C). The atmosphere remained capped for much of the day, but storms began to develop in the late afternoon hours in western Oklahoma and the eastern Texas Panhandle. The most intense supercells developed in the early evening hours across northwestern Oklahoma and southwestern Kansas. They eventually produced 25 tornadoes, including the devastating Greensburg tornado and three other extremely large tornadoes which followed the Greensburg tornado late that evening. The supercells remained intact well into the overnight hours as the extremely <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> mass precluded rapid dissipation expected with the loss of daytime heating which would normally be expected in the Plains. The last tornado of the night did not lift until shortly after 2:00a.m. early on May 5.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of May 31, a strong cap was in place over much of central Oklahoma into eastern Oklahoma. With dewpoints {{creeping}} into the low 70s, the Storm Prediction Center early on considered upgrading part of the moderate risk forecast zone to a high risk forecast zone. As the day went on, there was no upgrade, but it became evident the atmosphere was ripe with CAPE values in excess of 4000 J/kg. With {{the presence of an}} extremely <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> mass over central Oklahoma, the Storm Prediction Center issued a Particularly Dangerous Situation Tornado Watch for much of the state during the afternoon of May 31 and lasting into the night. Later that evening, severe storms rapidly developed, and an extremely large and violent multiple-vortex tornado devastated areas near El Reno, Oklahoma, and killed eight people including three men from the storm chasing crew, TWISTEX. The tornado had been rated EF5 based on mobile radar readings, Other weak tornadoes and major flooding devastated parts of the Oklahoma City metro that evening. Further north, a powerful squall line of severe storms with several embedded strong tornadoes developed in Missouri. One of the tornadoes, a large and rain-wrapped EF3, caused major damage in several St. Louis suburbs. Weak tornadoes touched down in several other states.|$|E
500|$|This term {{technically}} {{applies to}} a single thunderstorm with one main updraft. Also known as air-mass thunderstorms, these are the typical summer thunderstorms in many temperate locales. They also occur in the cool <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> that often follows {{the passage of a}} cold front from the sea during winter. Within a cluster of thunderstorms, the term [...] "cell" [...] refers to each separate principal updraft. Thunderstorm cells occasionally form in isolation, as the occurrence of one thunderstorm can develop an outflow boundary that sets up new thunderstorm development. Such storms are rarely severe and are a result of local atmospheric instability; hence the term [...] "air mass thunderstorm". When such storms have a brief period of severe weather associated with them, it is known as a pulse severe storm. Pulse severe storms are poorly organized and occur randomly in time and space, making them difficult to forecast. Single-cell thunderstorms normally last 20–30minutes.|$|E

2500|$|According to one source, {{the wind}} {{gradient}} is not significant for sailboats {{when the wind}} is over 6 knots (because a wind speed of 10 knots at the surface corresponds to 15 knots at 300 meters, so the change in speed is negligible over {{the height of a}} sailboat's mast). [...] According to the same source, the wind increases steadily with height up to about 10 meters in 5 knot winds but less if there is less wind. That source states that in winds with average speeds of six knots or more, the change of speed with height is confined almost entirely to the one or two meters closest to the surface. [...] This is consistent with another source, which shows that the change in wind speed is very small for heights over 2 meters and with a statement by the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology according to which differences can be as little as 5% in <b>unstable</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E
2500|$|These {{species are}} subdivisions of genus types {{that occur in}} partly <b>unstable</b> <b>air.</b> The species {{castellanus}} appears when a mostly stable stratocumuliform or cirriform layer becomes disturbed by localized areas of airmass instability, usually {{in the morning or}} afternoon. This results in the formation of cumuliform buildups arising from a common stratiform base. Castellanus resembles the turrets of a castle when viewed from the side, and can be found with stratocumuliform genera at any tropospheric altitude level and with limited-convective patches of high-level cirrus. Tufted clouds of the more detached floccus species are subdivisions of genus-types which may be cirriform or stratocumuliform in overall structure. They are sometimes seen with cirrus, and with tufted cirrocumulus, altocumulus, and stratocumulus. [...] Low and mid level castellanus or floccus can resemble cumulo- and cumulonimbogenitus formations (see 'Mother clouds' section). [...] However, the latter genitus types are seen mostly in the evening and are the result of cumuliform and cumulonimbiform clouds dissipating rather than forming or building.|$|E

2500|$|On March 1, 1997, very <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> invaded {{much of the}} {{affected}} area while much warmer temperatures were recorded. Temperatures across most of Arkansas which normally at that time are below [...] reached the mid to upper 70s °F (24°C). A cold front was approaching from the Midwestern Plains and {{was associated with a}} strong low further north. Strong temperature contrasts were observed {{on either side of the}} front. In addition, wind near the ground and aloft were very strong and significant shear was noted before given additional ingredients for extreme severe weather across the Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys on March 1, 1997. On February 28, 1997, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) had issued a Day 2 moderate risk of severe weather for much of Arkansas and a tornado watch was issued for the western and central part of the state during the morning hours of March 1. Early on March 1, the SPC issued a tornado watch for portions of the Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys. Throughout the day, the National Weather Service office in Little Rock, Arkansas, issued 57 weather warnings, including 34 tornado warnings. Areas affected by the deadly tornadoes had tornado warnings with lead time estimated at between nine and 28 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the local}} {{distribution}} of clouds can be significantly influenced by topography, the global prevalence of cloud cover tends to vary more by latitude. [...] It is most prevalent globally in and along low pressure zones of surface atmospheric convergence which encircle the Earth {{close to the}} equator and near the 50th parallels of latitude in {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres. [...] The adiabatic cooling processes that lead to the creation of clouds by way of lifting agents are all associated with convergence; a process that involves the horizontal inflow and accumulation of air at a given location, as well as the rate at which this happens. [...] Near the equator, increased cloudiness is due to the presence of the low-pressure Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) where very warm and <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> promotes mostly cumuliform and cumulonimbiform clouds. [...] Clouds of virtually any type can form along the mid-latitude convergence zones depending on the stability and moisture content of the air. [...] These extratropical convergence zones are occupied by the polar fronts where air masses of polar origin meet and clash with those of tropical or subtropical origin. This leads to the formation of weather-making extratropical cyclones composed of cloud systems that may be stable or unstable to varying degrees according to the stability characteristics of the various airmasses that are in conflict.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, in {{any type}} of thunderstorms, the surface cold pool of air {{associated}} the downdraft will stabilize the air and form a cloud free area which will end along the gust front. This mesoscale front, when moving into a warm and <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> mass, will lift it and cumulus clouds appear on satellite pictures. This line is likely the point of further convection and storms. One can notice it {{at the leading edge}} of a squall line, in the southeastern quadrant of a typical supercell (in the northern hemisphere), or different regions around other thunderstorms. They may also be visible as an outflow boundary hours or days after convection and can pinpoint areas of favored thunderstorm development, possible direction of movement, and even likelihood for tornadoes. The speed of forward movement of the outflow boundary or gust front to some degree modulates the likelihood of tornadoes and helps determine whether a storm will be enhanced by its presence or the inflow be choked off thus weakening and possibly killing the storm. [...] Thunderstorms may move along slow moving or stationary outflow boundaries and tornadoes are more likely; whereas fast moving gust fronts in many cases weaken thunderstorms after impact and are less likely to produce tornadoes—although brief tornadoes may occur at the time of impact. Fast moving gust fronts may eventually decelerate and become slow moving or stationary outflow boundaries with the characteristic [...] "agitated area" [...] of cumulus fields previously mentioned.|$|E

2500|$|At 7 am on March 18, {{the surface}} {{low-pressure}} area at ≈ moved to far northeastern Oklahoma {{and the warm}} front had shot north into the circulation where the front then extended eastward.
