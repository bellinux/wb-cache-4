25|$|Cemeteries for {{deceased}} {{prisoners were}} gradually opened near the camps. It {{was a point}} of honour for the survivors {{to take care of}} their comrades’ final resting places. Most often, each nationality had its own reserved patch. In certain camps, such as Gardelegen, veritable monuments were erected. Roger Pelletier motivated his comrades: “Doesn’t it fall to us, who have known them, to all of <b>us</b> <b>here</b> who are their great family, to raise, in the cemetery where they rest, a monument of the French soul that, spreading above them like an aegis, will be above our dead, when we have left, as a memory and a goodbye?” Wilhelm Doegen estimates the number of dead in the camps at 118,159 but serious doubts surround this number, notably because Doegen failed to take certain diseases into account. Also according to Doegen, Russia suffered the heaviest losses (perhaps explained by the poorer nutrition of Russians, most of whom did not receive packages from their families) with a little over 70,000 dead, followed by France with 17,069 deaths, Romania with 12,512, and then Italy and the United Kingdom.|$|E

500|$|Her sufferings {{during her}} last {{sickness}} were extreme. She felt conscious of danger, and, {{as far as}} human eye could see, prepared herself for her departure. She took a calm and effecting [...] leave of her friends that were present, and sent her last message to absent ones. She expressed the wish that others whom she loved would prepare while in health for the trying hour of death.

500|$|... "Lunch Time Cypher" [...] {{was meant}} to give {{the feeling of a}} high school cypher, {{complete}} with beatboxing, random, crazy lyrics from Hopsin, and featured artists Passionate MC and G-Mo Skee. The song [...] "What's My Purpose" [...] is, according to Hopsin, [...] "about a human born into this current dark society. How everybody is doing the same thing. Nobody is really different. And the government has <b>us</b> <b>here</b> to just make money." [...] He also touches on his race-related arrest after a concert in Orlando, Florida. The album's outro [...] "Caught In the Rain" [...] discusses about how Hopsin is soul-searching and needing to find himself.|$|E

500|$|The series {{begins with}} opening credits that depict {{traditional}} Roman myths, such as Romulus and Remus, the city's foundation mythos. For inspiration, visual effects and design company A52 explored museums, {{read the script}} and researched Roman history. They created the opening sequence entirely in-house. VFX artist Kirk Balden said of production, [...] "On many projects, you start off with storyboards and everyone has {{a good idea of}} what it's going to look like when it's completed. This project was very experimental right to the very end. The tone of it is pretty much unlike anything we've done and most of what any of <b>us</b> <b>here</b> have seen.

500|$|Although the festival's historian, Frederic Spotts, {{suggests}} that Cosima was more creative than she affected to be, {{the primary purpose}} of all her productions was to follow the instructions and reflect the wishes of the Master: [...] "There is nothing left for <b>us</b> <b>here</b> to create, but only to perfect in detail". This policy incurred criticism, among others from Bernard Shaw, who in 1889 mocked Cosima as the [...] "chief remembrancer". Shaw scorned the idea that Wagner's wishes were best represented by the slavish copying in perpetuity of the performances he had witnessed. Ten years later Shaw highlighted as a feature of the [...] "Bayreuth style" [...] the [...] "intolerably old-fashioned tradition of half rhetorical, half historical-pictorial attitudes and gestures", and the characteristic singing, [...] "sometime tolerable, sometimes abominable". The subordination of the music to text, diction and character portrayal was a specific feature of the Bayreuth style; Cosima, according to Spotts, turned the principle of clear enunciation into [...] "a fetish ... The resulting harsh declamatory style came to be derided as ... the infamous Bayreuth bark".|$|E
500|$|Jackson gave a prime-time {{speech at}} the 2008 Democratic National Convention on August 25, 2008. During his speech he {{referenced}} Martin Luther King Jr., stating, [...] "I'm sure that Dr. King is looking down on <b>us</b> <b>here</b> in Denver noting {{this is the first}} political convention in history to take place within sight of a mountain top." [...] Jackson said, [...] "I know Barack Obama. I've seen his leadership at work. I've seen the difference he has made in the lives of people across Illinois." [...] At the convention, Jackson started what was described as a [...] "hugfest" [...] in an attempt to unite the Illinois Democratic party, which had been squabbling internally. He started by hugging Bobby Rush (who had been upset that Jackson's wife was being positioned for Rush's seat when Rush had been ill earlier in the year) and then he hugged Debbie Halvorson, who as been at odds with him over the proposed airport. He then asked if anyone else was mad at him. At this point Mayor Daley jumped up to hug Jackson. Jackson then said [...] "I'm not going to be satisfied until I see Rod Blagojevich give Mike Madigan a hug." ...|$|E
500|$|Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music {{stated that}} he thought the song was {{not as good as}} [...] "Toxic" [...] by Britney Spears but was {{incredibly}} similar. After dubbing it a weaker version of [...] "Toxic", he said, [...] "And that just leaves <b>us</b> <b>here</b> with a song [...] which is all stomp and huff, a dramatic bang of a thing, which seeks to drag all the bad girls to the dancefloor so they can holler their evil intentions to into the faces of nervous men. It's a song which makes the most of Nicole's unwholesome sexiness– as opposed to wholesome, you understand, I'm not saying there's anything gross about her– and has drama and fury on its side." [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy agreed saying that [...] "Scherzinger has managed to bag herself a banger of an (ahem) debut single". He described the song's busy production as [...] "having a whiff of the Berline [...] "teknoklub" [...] that is a [...] "racket in the best possible way". Levine also praised Scherzinger for her conviction on the song, awarding it five out of five stars. He gave [...] "Poison" [...] a better reception than he awarded Scherzinger's previous attempt, [...] "Baby Love" [...] (2007), which he only awarded three out of five stars, stating that it was the wrong single to launch the career of a world-class superstar.|$|E

500|$|The {{performance}} of Hextall {{in the next}} game tied the series and forced a seventh game; at the end, the Flyers team surrounded Hextall in congratulation and the Oilers player Kevin Lowe said that Hextall [...] "held them in it". Between the sixth and seventh games, the Oilers' forward Wayne Gretzky described Hextall as [...] "probably the best goaltender I've ever played against in the NHL" [...] Edmonton won {{the final game of}} the series to take the Stanley Cup. Robin Finn, writing in The New York Times, said that the team won the title [...] "without their trademark, those endless waves of madcap scoring", primarily due to the [...] "heroics of Hextall". Flyers teammate Rick Tocchet said that when he realised his side were going to lose, his [...] "first thought was to feel sorry for Ronny Hextall, because he did everything he could to get <b>us</b> <b>here</b> and keep us in it." [...] Hextall was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy for the most valuable player in the playoffs, becoming only the fourth player from a losing side to be awarded the trophy. During the off-season, Hextall received an eight-game suspension {{for the start of the}} 1987–88 season after his slash on Nilsson. Speaking on behalf of the NHL, Brian O'Neill said that: [...] "There is no justification for any player to swing his stick in retaliation and this is especially the case for a goaltender whose stick, because of its weight, can cause serious injury." ...|$|E
