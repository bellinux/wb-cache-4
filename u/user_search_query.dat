The problem of selecting, {{in relation to a}} <b>user</b> <b>search</b> <b>query,</b> the most relevant documents from an unstructured source such as the WWW is discussed in detail. The need for extending classical information retrieval techniques such as boolean searching and vector space models with link-based ranking methods is demonstrated. The PageRank algorithm is introduced, and its numerical and spectral properties are discussed. The article concludes with an alternative means of computing PageRank, along with some example applications of this new method...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Many {{of current}} web search engines rely on {{inverted}} index-based data structures as document information store. Since and inverted index is a map from individual document words {{to their respective}} locations, such data structure destructs semantic links between the words, and thus does not support structural user queries. In other words, such systems can only find the documents that contain user-specified words. In this paper we propose to create semantic links between the terms contained in inverted index, and in such way create a semantic network. This network will preserve the internal structure of the stored documents, and will enable the users to perform structural queries. Both structural-saving indexation and structural <b>user</b> <b>search</b> <b>query</b> allow to save semantic speech {{meaning of the text}} while search process. I...|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{clustering}} the refinements of a <b>user</b> <b>search</b> <b>query.</b> The clusters computed by our proposed algorithm can be used to improve the selection and placement of the query suggestions proposed by a search engine, and can also serve to summarize the different aspects of information relevant to the original user query. Our algorithm clusters refinements based on their likely underlying user intents by combining document click and session cooccurrence information. At its core, our algorithm operates by performing multiple random walks on a Markov graph that approximates user search behavior. A user study performed on top search engine queries shows that our clusters are rated better than corresponding clusters computed using approaches that use only document click or only sessions co-occurrence information. 1...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{high stress}} on search engines due to the {{overload}} of information content in the internet. Search query submitted by the user to the search engine represents the user requirements. Sometimes, particular desire of the user cannot be fulfilled by the <b>user</b> <b>search</b> <b>query.</b> Also, long listed search result may not be always significant to the user requirements and irrelevant documents are returned {{by many of the}} existing search engines which follow the mechanism of keyword matching. Indeed, both the users and search engine developers need to reduce the information content in the internet. In this paper, we aim to infer the user search goal by considering the clicked URLs and reorganize the web search result. We use FG-FCM based clustering for grouping the semantically similar search results which further enhances the reorganized search result...|$|E

We use the largest collection of genealogy person records in the world together with <b>user</b> <b>search</b> <b>query</b> logs to build name matching models. The procedure for building a crowd-sourced training set is outlined together with the presentation of our method. We cast the problem of learning alternative spellings as a machine translation problem at the character level. We use in- formation retrieval evaluation methodology to show that this method substantially outperforms on our data a number of standard well known phonetic and string similarity methods in terms of precision and re- call. Additionally, we rigorously compare the performance of standard methods when compared with each other. Our result can lead to a significant practical impact in entity resolution applications...|$|E
40|$|An {{information}} retrieval (IR) system (IRs) (search engine) {{is said to}} be efficient, to the degree that always evaluates each object in the information base (database, document base, web, [...] .) like the expert. The ability of IRs's is to retrieve mostly all relevant objects (measured by the recall), and only the (most) relevant objects (measured by the precision) from the collection queried. Recall and precision measures provide the classical measure of the retrieval efficiency. They measure {{the degree to which the}} query answer (the set of documents that retrieved by IRs as response to the user query). Where, the query answer is the set of relevant documents in the information based queried. Retrieving most relevant documents to the user query in IRs was one of the most important methods of World Wide Web (WWW) search engines used in the world now. So the searchers aim to use genetic programming (GP) and fuzzy optimization to optimize the <b>user</b> <b>search</b> <b>query</b> in the Boolean IRs model and in the fuzzy IRs model; and to use more Boolean operators (AND, OR, XOR, OF, and NOT) instead of using the standard operators (AND, OR, and NOT), and to use weights for terms and for Boolean operators. Weights are used to give the users more relaxation in defining how much the importance of the terms and of the Boolean operators is. The terms and the Boolean operators' weights are used in fuzzy IRs model. In addition, it investigates extensions of the classical measurement of effectiveness in IRs, precision; recall and harmonic mean. The researchers use harmonic mean measure as an objective function which uses both measures precision and recall at once for evaluating the results of the two IRs models to grow up the precision-recall relationship curve...|$|E

40|$|Unknown words lead to bad {{answers in}} Question Answering. Next to {{traditional}} Question Answering challenges, web search applications face another challenge {{when dealing with}} unknown words: {{they have to deal}} with the language found in user queries. User queries are frequently ungrammatical, have a telegram style and contain misspelled words, all of which make their automatic interpretation very difficult. Although little research has been done on finding unknown words in <b>user</b> <b>search</b> <b>queries,</b> we will show that this is a valuable goal. Q-go is a company specialized in natural language search, but like most search engines, it has difficulty interpreting unknown words when these appear in <b>user</b> <b>search</b> <b>queries.</b> We investigated how often unknown words occur and also which lexical types are responsible for the unknowns Q-go encounters in three domains. This has provided a useful and unique insight in unknown words in a real world application. Many projects do not take the time to analyze the data manually. The manual analysis showed that the majority of unknowns words in the data are named entities (28. 4 %), so further research concentrated on the identification and semantic classification of named entities in <b>user</b> <b>search</b> <b>queries.</b> Two context-based approaches to reduce the number of named entities were compared, Paşca (2007) and Pennacchiotti and Pantel (2006). Starting from a small set of seed entities we extract candidates for various classes of interest to web <b>search</b> <b>users.</b> We experimented with multiple parameters, similarity metrics and the three domains, among others. The most promising reulst were obtained with the approach based on Paşca (2007). The productivity of a class seems to be the factor most predictive of success in finding new named entities of the correct semantic class. Further, the approach of Paşca (2007) was able to successfully deal with user query language, also an important result. ...|$|R

5000|$|While {{there are}} {{documented}} {{benefits of the}} implementation of search personalization, there are also arguments against its use. The foundation of this argument against its use is because it confines internet users' search engine results to material that aligns with the users' interests and history. It limits the users' ability to become exposed to material that would be relevant to the <b>user's</b> <b>search</b> <b>query</b> but {{due to the fact}} that some of this material differs from the user's interests and history, the material is not displayed to the <b>user.</b> <b>Search</b> personalization takes the objectivity out of the search engine and undermines the engine. [...] "Objectivity matters little when you know what you are looking for, but its lack is problematic when you do not". Another criticism of search personalization is that it limits a core function of the web: the collection and sharing of information. <b>Search</b> personalization prevents <b>users</b> from easily accessing all the possible information that is available for a specific <b>search</b> <b>query.</b> <b>Search</b> personalization adds a bias to <b>user's</b> <b>search</b> <b>queries.</b> If a <b>user</b> has a particular set of interests or internet history and uses the web to research a controversial issue, the <b>user's</b> <b>search</b> results will reflect that. The user may not be shown both sides of the issue and miss potentially important information if the user's interests lean to one side or another. A study done on search personalization and its effects on search results in Google News resulted in different orders of news stories being generated by different users, even though each user entered the same <b>search</b> <b>query.</b> According to Bates, [...] "only 12% of the searchers had the same three stories in the same order. This to me is prima facie evidence that there is filtering going on". If search personalization was not active, all the results in theory should have been the same stories in an identical order.|$|R

We firstly extract temporal features, such as burst and periodicity, from query frequency curves and then define the temporal query similarity by integrating these new features with the temporal query frequency distribution. Compared to the traditional temporal similarity measurements such as correlation coefficient, our proposed approach is more effective owing to the explicit extraction of high-level semantic query temporal features for similarity measure.

40|$|On the web, {{search engines}} {{represent}} a primary instrument through which users exercise their intent. Understanding the specific goals <b>users</b> express in <b>search</b> <b>queries</b> could improve our theoretical knowledge about strategies for search goal formulation and search behavior, and could equip search engine providers with better descriptions of users’ information needs. However, {{the degree to}} which goals are explicitly expressed in <b>search</b> <b>queries</b> can be suspected to exhibit considerable variety, which poses a series of challenges for researchers and search engine providers. This paper introduces a novel perspective on analyzing <b>user</b> goals in <b>search</b> <b>query</b> logs by proposing to study different degrees of intentional explicitness. To explore the implications of this perspective, we studied two different degrees of explicitness of user goals in the AOL <b>search</b> <b>query</b> log containing more than 20 million queries. Our results suggest that different degrees of intentional explicitness represent an orthogonal dimension to existing <b>search</b> <b>query</b> categories and that understanding these different degrees is essential for effective search.
