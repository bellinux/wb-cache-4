5000|$|Each tablet {{is made by}} {{pressing}} the granules inside a die, made up of hardened steel. The die is adisc shape with a hole cut through its centre. The powder is compressed in {{the centre of the}} die by two hardened steel punches that fit into {{the top and bottom of}} the die.The punches and dies are fixed to a turret that spins round.As it spins, the punches are driven together by two fixed cams - an <b>upper</b> <b>cam</b> and lower cam. The top of the upper punch (the punch head) sits on the <b>upper</b> <b>cam</b> edge [...]The bottom of the lower punch sits on the lower cam edge.|$|E

The 210/211 service provides {{a link between}} Dursley, Cam and the station, and runs to a timetable that links in with trains to both Gloucester and Bristol. Service 87 runs from Dursley to Wotton-under-Edge and Thornbury every 2 hours during the day, and service 281 provides an infrequent service to Coaley, Ashmead Green, <b>Upper</b> <b>Cam</b> and Dursley.|$|E
5000|$|The second-generation 4A-GE {{produced}} from 1987 to 1989 featured larger diameter bearings for the connecting-rod big ends (42 mm) and added four additional reinforcement ribs {{on the back}} of the engine block, for a total of seven. The T-VIS feature is maintained. It is visually similar to the first-generation engine (only the <b>upper</b> <b>cam</b> cover now featured red and black lettering) and the US market power output was only increased to [...] The first- and second-generation engines are very popular with racers and tuners because of their availability, ease of modification, simple design, and lightness.|$|E
40|$|Squamous cell {{carcinoma}} {{of the head and}} neck (SCCHN) is an aggressive disease with poor survival and is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. Gastroesophageal reflux is a common event in SCCHN patients. GPR 4 is a proton-sensing G-protein coupled receptor, which can be activated by acidosis. The objective of this study was to explore the role of GPR 4 in acid exposure and tumor angiogenesis in SCCHN. In this study, we confirmed that overexpressing GPR 4 in SCCHN cells could increase the expression and secretion of IL 6, IL 8 and VEGFA at pH 5. 9. This effect could be inhibited by SB 203580 (a p 38 inhibitor). Western blot analysis indicated that phosphorylation of p 38 increased in GPR 4 infected cells at pH 5. 9, which could be inhibited by SB 203580. In tube formation assay, HMEC- 1 cells were incubated with conditioned medium (CM, pH 5. 9, 6. 5, 7. 4) derived from control and GPR 4 infected SCCHN cells. Tube length was significantly increased in HMEC- 1 cells incubated with CM from GPR 4 infected cells compared with control cells at pH 5. 9, which indicated the pro-angiogenic effect of GPR 4 in acidic pH. The neutralizing antibodies of IL 6, IL 8 and VEGFA could inhibit tube formation of HMEC- 1 cells. In vivo, the effect of GPR 4 on angiogenesis was investigated with the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model. Control and GPR 4 infected SCCHN cells were seeded onto the <b>upper</b> <b>CAM</b> surface (n = 5 in each group) and 5 μL DMEM/F 12 (pH 5. 9, 6. 5, 7. 4) was added to the surface of the cell every 24 h. Four days later, the <b>upper</b> <b>CAM</b> were harvested and the ratio of the vascular area to the CAM area was quantified using Image-Pro Plus 6. 0 software. GPR 4 infected cells could recruit more vascular than control cells at pH 5. 9. In conclusion, we suggested that GPR 4 induces angiogenesis via GPR 4 -induced p 38 -mediated IL 6, IL 8 and VEGFA secretion at acidic extracellular pH in SCCHN...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} {{about the process of}} {{converting}} a petrol-fuelled Honda GX 35 engine to run on methane gas. The future goal is to use the engine in the engineering competition Shell Eco-marathon, where the aim is to drive a vehicle as far as possible with a set amount of fuel. To enable methane fuelling, the carburator of the GX 35 was replaced with a gas fuel injector from the engine accessory company Ecotrons. This was attached to an aluminium intake pipe constructed by the project group. A new flywheel was constructed, equipped with twelve magnetic detection points instead of one for more accurate detection of the crankshaft position. A magnet was also attached to the <b>upper</b> <b>cam</b> pulley to enable position detection. The original exhaust system was replaced by a holder of a lambda sensor and a straight exhaust pipe. Together with the engine control unit (ECU) KATLA, developed earlier for a bachelor’s thesis at Chalmers, this enabled detailed control of ignition and fuel injection, as well as measurement of the air-fuel ratio. In order to test the engine with a load, a brake device was constructed. A moped was acquired, whose gearbox and rear brake was used to brake and gear down the output shaft of the methane engine. The flywheel of the methane engine was connected to the flywheel of the moped through a vibration reducing rubber disc and a steel adapter. The rear wheel of the moped was lifted from the ground with a support so that it could rotate freely. By doing this, the load of the engine could be controlled with the rear brake pedal of the moped. Methane was not available for the project group, so the engine was tested with liquefied petroleum gas instead, which is another gaseous fuel. Before the engine was started, the flow rate through the gas injector was measured. This data was used to set the fuel parameters in the ECU. With some minor adjustments the engine ran well during testing...|$|E
