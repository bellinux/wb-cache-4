40|$|Natural {{disasters}} raise quite {{a number}} of interdisciplinary issues concerning regional economic growth and local development, as well as public finance and sustainability, to mention only a few of them. These issues deserve special attention in our globalized world, given the expectation of a growing impact of climate-related disasters: no surprise that disaster management stands as a new discipline aimed at bridging the gap between theory and practice, so as to prevent natural disasters in the first place; afterwards, considerable efforts are required to accelerate business recovery, quickly restore vital energies, and hopefully carry out specific improvement projects as a sort of compensation for the (both personal and economic) losses suffered. Interesting lessons can be learned from natural disasters and can be shared as a payback to those who helped upon their occurrence. Actually, cooperation calls for cross-cultural activities that are likely to benefit from direct experience made by impacted scholars and practitioners: a case in point {{has to do with the}} earthquake that devastated LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Aquila and its environs on April 6, 2009 causing more than 300 deaths, apart from extensive damage in the Abruzzo region, in Central Italy; the Abruzzo event Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as this natural disaster is currently referred to Ã¢â‚¬â€œ fuels the debate on redevelopment problems to be faced under similar circumstances, that may obliterate the economic environment and attractiveness of an area in a few moments. Due to the huge amount of money needed to undertake appropriate strategies, finance plays a key role and useful insights can be gained by exploring the process of financial innovation. A supporting argument deals with the recourse to micro-finance in order to make the business and economic scenario revive after a natural disaster: micro-credit might be resorted to even within the framework of new financial engineering instruments, such as <b>Urban</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Funds,</b> recently promoted by the European Investment Bank; they include JESSICA (Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas) and JEREMIE (Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises), to be properly considered as strategic tools in sight of redeveloping LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Aquila and its surrounding boroughs. ...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, {{urbanisation}} rapidly increased in European countries and forced European policy makers {{to adapt to}} those changing circumstances. In 2006, the European Commission reacted to the arising urban needs by launching the JESSICA (Joint European Support for Sustainable Investments in City Areas) initiative to promote new instruments for financing urban regeneration and renewal. In contrast to traditional grant funding, this initiative aims to provide revolving financial instruments – equity, loans, and guarantees – organised as funds and co-financed by other investors. The four working papers of this thesis analyse the whole structure surrounding these so-called <b>Urban</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Funds</b> (UDFs). The first paper analyses the general need for urban development funding regardless of the financial subsidy instrument. It elaborates on measuring differences among cities, regions, or countries {{by the use of}} indicators representing numerous aspects of urban life. Principal Component Analysis is used to identify a small set of indicators relevant to the comparison of urban development {{for each of the three}} geographical units: cities, regions, and countries. The second paper focuses on failures in urban capital markets and their connection to urban development projects. It analyses three main market imperfections which justify public authority intervention. Depending on the (combination of) market imperfections connected to a particular category of urban development projects, either grants or revolving instruments – equity, loans, and guarantees – are the suitable subsidy means to remedy market failures and initiate project financing. The third paper combines and extends the results of the former two papers to reveal possible regional targets for the establishment of UDFs by a three step approach. The first step consists of computing a distance measurement between possible funding targets. The second step describes the movability through former funding, i. e., the funding efficiency measured by a Data Envelopment Analysis. The last step considers the market imperfections revealed by the needs of the respective urban projects. Finally, the fourth paper analyses whether a second level of funds is beneficial in the context of urban development support. A second level diversifies among first-level funds which have restricted investment universes such as regionally focused UDFs. This multi-level fund structure is beneficial for medium to high degrees of investor’s risk aversion due to the (low) costs incurred by this additional passive fund level. All in all, this thesis broadly covers a new and unexplored topic which is of high relevance to our society today and in the near future. The overall contribution is twofold. On the one hand, it provides tools for the analysis of several aspects of urban development and its financial support. These tools enable novel objective investigations for the establishment of UDFs which are not possible up to now. On the other hand, some general insights could be gained in the four papers. First of all, it was found to be important that funding decisions rely on indicator values for the considered geographical level to ensure the coherence of actual funding needs with the allocation of funds. Second, some types of projects suggested for UDFs should rather be supported by traditional grants. Finally, a second-level fund for urban development can indeed deliver risk reduction and should not remain a purely administrational unit...|$|E

We argue that, {{if they are}} to avoid debilitat-ing frame disputes, coalitions seeking social change face the unique task of developing a "consonant frame pyra-mid, " which aligns coalition, organizational, and individual frames. We show the usefulness of these concepts for understanding framing through analysis of a local coalition formed to better {{meet the needs of the}} homeless. Using information gathered via interviews, participant observation, and documents, we describe several of the organizational frames that were contending for adoption as the larger coalition 's frame, and detail two of the frame disputes that developed.

We contend that organizations vary in their ability to promote a coalition frame due to varying degrees ofpower, different organizational structures, and varying degrees of "fit " between organi-zational frames and the existing political opportunities and constraints. These findings reveal coalition frames as the emergent products of ongoing intra- and inter-organizational dynamics, and help specify framing 's links to mobilizing structures and political opportunity.

40|$|How {{does the}} state ‘perform’ people’s {{participation}} and public consultation exercises {{in a context}} where it is increasingly forced to rely on private capital to build infrastructure? How do these new forms of participation and consultation articulate with existing institutions of people’s representation? Are the new mandates for citizen participation and public consultation that are written into the reform agenda driving a further wedge into the already fractured citizenship that characterizes the Indian urban polity? These are the questions posed by this paper. While ‘participatory development’ itself has come under critique since the late 1990 s for its demonstrated effects of disenfranchising marginalised groups, manufacturing consensus for plans already made, and/or closing off alternative pathways for transformation, this paper argues that contemporary practices of public consultation and citizen participation have {{moved out of the}} ambit of such critiques. No longer do they contain more than tokenistic gestures toward broad inclusion or people’s empowerment. Instead, the imperatives of ‘fast-tracking’ India’s cities into a post-Third World regime of ‘global cities’, have given new shape and meaning to contemporary practices of participation and consultation. The paper explores notions of participation as located in ‘second generation’ or institutional reforms, particularly as articulated by prominent state-sponsored public-private partnerships such as the Bangalore Agenda Task Force (BATF) and the Tamilnadu <b>Urban</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Fund</b> (TNUDF). These ‘model’ partnerships provided key programmatic elements that became the basis of national reform programs, notably the Jawarharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM).

The second part of the chapter investigates why Liverpool was selected as the location for Tate’s new museum. This section examines the regional and national networks of support established by Tate’s director and trustees. On a regional level this involved consulting with local political and cultural representatives to identify what Tate’s presence could contribution to the economic and cultural prosperity of the region. On a national level, this involved securing funding for the project by agreeing to {{play a key role in}} the centrally-controlled Merseyside Development Corporation’s ambition to acquire Liverpool’s derelict Albert Dock for conversion into a mixed use leisure, retail and luxury residential complex.

Bisherige Versuche der Städtebauförderung die Einbindung privater Kleineigentümer in quartiersbezogene Handlungsansätze zu stimulieren zeigen, dass dies bislang nur unzureichend gelingt. Auf rationalen Handlungslogiken basierende Theorien sprechen im Zusammenhang der privaten Erstellung öffentlicher Güter sogar von „Marktversagen“. Und trotzdem existieren bereits erste Eigentümerstandortgemeinschaften (ESG) in Deutschland. Was ermöglichte dieses private Engagement? Angesichts fehlender empirischer Daten über freiwilliges kollektives Handeln privater Eigentümer in der Quartiers-entwicklung, geht die vorliegende Dissertation der Frage nach, welche Faktoren die Entstehung von ESG bestimmen und die institutionelle Struktur von ESG charakterisieren. Zur Beantwortung der Forschungsfrage wurde ein vergleichendes Fallstudiendesign mit ESG in Dortmund, Essen und Görlitz gewählt. Die Ergebnisse der Dissertation verdeutlichen, dass ESG als abhängige Variable sowohl durch die individuellen Interessen bzw. Handlungsstrategien der Immobilieneigentümer bei der Bewirtschaftung ihrer Immobilien, als auch durch den Steuerungsanspruch staatlicher Akteure in der Quartiersentwicklung bestimmt werden. Die Autorin leitet die individuellen und kollektiven Handlungsstrategien der Akteure her und setzt sich mit der individuellen Motivation zum Handeln auseinander. Zusätzlich werden grundlegende institutionelle Merkmale von ESG und ihre Eigenheit als Urban Governance-Ansatz diskutiert. Aus den als Hypothesen formulierten Ergebnissen werden abschließend Schlussfolgerungen für die Praxis sowie der weitere Forschungsbedarf abgeleitet. This PhD thesis {{deals with}} a concept of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> which is at present in a pilot phase in Germany, the Local Property Owner Partnership (LoPOP). These are characterized by a voluntary collective development of the quarter at the initiative of the property owners. The demographic, economic and social structures lead to spatially differentiated changes which induce complex problems in <b>urban</b> <b>development.</b> Among others, this {{may result in a}} notable increase of vacant flats, an increasing demand for low-barrier flats or in investment backlogs of the public infrastructure. A large part of the up-coming investment tasks concerns private property and requires action by private property owners, e. g. in the development of living space. Attempts to activate proprietors via <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> <b>funding</b> have shown minor success up to now. Current <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> policy formulates the idea to reach a positive development of structurally weak quarters by a more intensified participation of private actors in collective approaches. In view of the missing of empirical data on voluntary action by private proprietors in the <b>urban</b> <b>development,</b> the PhD thesis investigates which factors determine the establishment of Local Property Owner Partnerships and characterize their institutional structure. Due to the small number of existing LoPOPs in Germany {{as well as to the}} limited number of scientific publications dealing with this subject, a comparative case study design was chosen. Fifty-six partially structured interviews were held in three heterogeneously distinctive LoPOPs in Dortmund, Essen and Görlitz. The transcribed interview data were processed by means of reconstructive content analyses and the results were formulated as hypotheses. The results of the thesis show that the subject of examination, LoPOPs, can be discussed with respect to actor-related and institutional theories as well as governance approaches. LoPOPs are defined as a dependent variable with respect to the individual interests and strategies of action of the property owners concerning their real estate management as well as to the governance requirements of state actors concerning the development of the quarter. Thereby, it has become apparent that one should make a distinction between the strategies of action of the state and the private actors. Both groups show three basic types of action strategies which have constructional and social as well as structural impacts on the quarter. The individual strategies of action of the proprietors are invest, wait and exit. With regard to the quarter, the municipal actors have the strategies develop, wait or retract at their disposal. Moreover, the data analyses discovered a path dependency between the individual management strategies of the proprietors and their action in the collective situation. The actors who are focusing on wait or on exit play the role of free riders. With regard to the proprietors who are willing to invest, three collective strategies of action may be noted: wait, individual effort and cooperation. As a central motive for choosing the collective strategy of action cooperation and, thus for commitment to participating in the LoPOP, the reduction of uncertainty could be identified. According to this, the preparedness for cooperation depends on the intensity of uncertainty in the management of the property and, thus, also on the degree of being affected by the above mentioned structural change. Whether the LoPOP is a suitable tool for the elimination of this uncertainty is closely connected with its institutional structure. LoPOPs are - taking into account the specific constellation of actors - characterized by high transaction costs, due to the low legal and social possibilities for sanctions. Therefore, a clear value of the projects and the common standards of the actors are all the more necessary for success. LoPOPs deal with the development of quarters and produce, as a private initiative, also public goods. This establishes the public interest in their development. The results of the thesis show that, due to the constellation of actors, interests and themes in voluntary LoPOPs, the state actors concentrate on the interaction form of the horizontal coordination. Therefore, LoPOPs can be referred to as a form of Urban Governance. Moreover, it becomes obvious that, when the mission statement of a voluntary, informal and private network of small proprietors shall be realised, on the one hand free riders cannot be avoided, on the other hand the public authorities are indispensable providing consulting and financial support. In comparison with traditional approaches of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> <b>funding,</b> LoPOPs, as collective development approaches, need an intensive involvement of local actors in addition to the thematic debate during their preparation. The thesis terminates with conclusions for practice as well as needs for further research drawn from the generated hypotheses. The needs for further research refer inter alia to the evaluation of effects of the LoPOPs; the analysis of learning processes among the groups of actors in the development process and in the verification of the generated hypotheses in this work...|$|R
40|$|This report {{makes an}} {{overview}} of 2 D, 2, 5 D and 3 D approaches for indoor space subdivision {{for the purpose of}} indoor navigation. The report starts with a conceptual framework for indoor space utilisation. We introduce and elaborate on the concepts of indoor space (navigable and non-navigable), agent, activity, resource and modifier. Using these concepts, we investigate navigation cases and discuss information requirements for space subdivision. Two sections make review of 2 D and 3 D research for sub-spacing. We classify 2 D and 3 D approached in three groups with respect to the subdivision (partial or complete) and the type of navigation (grid or graph), and provide analysis of the approaches against the user requirements for indoor navigation. Section 6 concludes on challenges and future developments.

50|$|Stronger {{than the}} Storm was an {{advertising}} {{campaign to promote}} tourism in New Jersey in 2013. It portrayed the state as being resilient and having recovered from the impact and aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, which had caused severe damage in Autumn 2012. The media blitz included billboards, radio spots, and television commercials featuring the Jersey Shore and including appearances by the Governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, {{and his wife and}} children. The United States Department of Housing and <b>Urban</b> <b>Development</b> (HUD) provided <b>funding</b> for the promotional campaign. The awarding of the contract to marketing firm MWW and the propriety of Christie's use of the ads during a re-election campaign has drawn media and governmental scrutiny. In January 2014, HUD initiated an audit of the expenditure. The audit is one of two simultaneous federal inquiries begun in 2014 involving the Chris Christie administration use of federal funds provided by the Hurricane Sandy relief bill.|$|R
