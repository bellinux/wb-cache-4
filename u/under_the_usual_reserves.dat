Scores <b>under</b> <b>the</b> best image instructions (M = 23. 85, SD = 6. 52) were higher than scores <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> instructions (M = 18. 00, SD = 5. 40). <b>The</b> scores produced <b>under</b> <b>the</b> best image instructions were independent of scores produced <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> instructions.
