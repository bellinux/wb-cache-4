40|$|Speedmeters {{are known}} to be quantum non-demolition devices and, by {{potentially}} providing sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit, become interesting for third generation gravitational wave detectors. Here we introduce a new configuration, the sloshing-Sagnac interferometer, and compare it to the more established ring-Sagnac interferometer. The sloshing-Sagnac interferometer is designed to provide improved quantum noise limited sensitivity and lower coating thermal noise than standard position meter interferometers employed in current gravitational wave detectors. We compare the quantum noise limited sensitivity of the ring-Sagnac and the sloshing-Sagnac interferometers, in the frequency range, from 5 Hz to 100 Hz, where they provide the greatest potential benefit. We evaluate the improvement in terms of the <b>unweighted</b> <b>noise</b> reduction below the standard quantum limit, and by finding the range up to which binary black hole inspirals may be observed. The sloshing-Sagnac was found to give approximately similar or better sensitivity than the ring-Sagnac in all cases. We also show that by eliminating the requirement for maximally-reflecting cavity end mirrors with correspondingly-thick multi-layer coatings, coating noise can be reduced by a factor of approximately 2. 2 compared to conventional interferometers...|$|E

The <b>unweighted</b> integrated active <b>noise</b> control and noise reduction scheme introduced in previous work does not allow to trade-off between the active noise control and the noise reduction. In some circumstances it will however be useful to emphasize one of the functional blocks. Changing the original optimisation problem to a constrained optimisation problem leads to a scheme based on a weighted mean squared error criterion that allows to focus either on the active noise control or on the noise reduction. It is similarly possible to derive a scheme that allows to focus either on reducing the speech distortion or on reducing the residual noise at the eardrum. In a single speech source scenario and {{when the number of}} sound sources (speech plus noise sources) is {{less than or equal to}} the number of microphones, it is possible to derive a simple formula for the output signal-to-noise ratio of the latter scheme. It can then be shown that this scheme delivers a constant signal-to-noise ratio at the eardrum for any weighting factor...|$|R
