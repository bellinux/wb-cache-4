5|$|On July 5, 1861, at {{nineteen}} Myers {{became a}} teller and cashier at the Mohawk Valley Bank. General Francis E. Spinner was the {{treasurer of the}} bank at the time. His first year as a trainee was without pay. Myers then received a salary of $100 per year, being higher than normal since he put in extra attention to his work habits. He opened his own little telegraph office in July 1863 within the counting office of the bank. This was the first telegraph office for the town of Mohawk, New York. He constructed all the necessary telegraph equipment needed and taught himself Morse code. Myers' income from this bank telegraph business was one-half of his total income. He eventually had to give <b>up</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> part-time telegraph operator within the bank, as his bank responsibilities took up most of his time.

5|$|The {{prototype}} of the prison genre was The Big House (1930). In The Big House, Robert Montgomery plays a squirmy inmate who is sentenced to six years after committing vehicular manslaughter while under the influence. His cell mates are a murderer played by Wallace Beery and a forger played by Chester Morris. The picture features future staples of the prison genre such as solitary confinement, informers, riots, visitations, an escape, and the codes of prison life. The protagonist, Montgomery, ends <b>up</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> loathsome character, a coward who will sell anyone in the prison out to get an early release. The film was banned in Ohio, {{the site of the}} deadly prison riots that inspired it. Numbered Men, The Criminal Code, Shadow of the Law, Convict's Code, and others, from no less than seven studios, followed. However, prison films mainly appealed to men, and had weak box office performances as a result.|$|E

5|$|Tucker McCall is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the American CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless. Introduced by former head writer Maria Arena Bell, the character debuted during the episode airing on December 2, 2009, portrayed by William Russ.

However, Tucker ended <b>up</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> new character who would be revealed as Katherine Chancellor's (Jeanne Cooper) long lost son. Russ was let go shortly after his debut due to producers wanting to take the character in a different direction, resulting in the hiring of Stephen Nichols as his replacement.|$|E
5|$|Jarvis and DeMar playtested {{the game}} themselves, and {{continually}} tweaked the designs {{as the project}} progressed. Though games at the time began to use scrolling to have larger levels, the developers chose a single screen to confine the action. To instill panic in the player, the character was initially placed {{in the center of}} the game's action, and had to deal with projectiles coming from multiple directions, as opposed previous shooting games such as Space Invaders and Galaxian, where the enemies attacked from a single direction. This made for more challenging gameplay, an aspect Jarvis took pride in. Enemies were assigned to stages in different groups to create themes. Early stages were designed to be relatively simple compared to later ones. The level of difficulty was designed to increase quickly so players would struggle to complete later stages. In retrospect, Jarvis attributes his and DeMar's average player skills to the game's balanced design. Though they made the game as difficult as they could, the high end of their skills ended <b>up</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> good challenge for expert players. The graphics were given a simple appearance to avoid a cluttered game screen, and object designs were made distinct from each other to avoid confusion. Black was chosen as the background color to help characters stand out and reduce clutter.|$|E

Almost a year after Katherine's death, Jill finds her most expensive jewelry to have been hidden in a chandelier at the Chancellor Estate. Enclosed with a note, Katherine left them there for Jill to find before her death as they are worth a significant amount.

Afterward, all of Katherine's loved ones receive letters from her that were to be delivered on the one-year anniversary of her death. She also asks them to throw a party and celebrate, which they do. Once the party in the park is finished, Jill leaves the music box there, only for it to be stolen by an unidentified person.
