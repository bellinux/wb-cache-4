A report in 2002 indicated that Taftan may be a feasible place to install a binary cycle power plant at Taftan.|$|E
5|$|In Ratchet & Clank, {{the main}} playable {{character}} is Ratchet, whom the player controls from a third-person perspective, though a first person mode {{to view the}} player's surroundings is available. The player traverses diverse environments with a large collection of unusual gadgets and weapons, <b>using</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> defeat enemies and pass obstacles. Up to 36 weapons and gadgets can be bought or found in the game.|$|E
25|$|The {{expressions}} A ⊂ B and B ⊃ A {{are used}} differently by different authors; some authors <b>use</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> {{mean the same}} as A ⊆ B (respectively B ⊇ A), whereas others <b>use</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> mean the same as A ⊊ B (respectively B ⊋ A).|$|R

RCN-8 are a subset of GTIN-8 which begin with a first digit of 0 or 2.|$|R
5|$|In the episode, the Doctoran alien time-traveller {{played by}} David Tennantand his {{companion}} Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) and Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) find time windows on a 51st-century spaceship leading to 18th-century France {{and a group}} of clockwork androids <b>using</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> stalk Madame de Pompadour throughout her life.|$|E
5|$|A few insects, such {{as members}} of the {{families}} Poduridae and Onychiuridae (Collembola), Mycetophilidae (Diptera) and the beetle families Lampyridae, Phengodidae, Elateridae and Staphylinidae are bioluminescent. The most familiar group are the fireflies, beetles of the family Lampyridae. Some species are able to control this light generation to produce flashes. The function varies with some species <b>using</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> attract mates, while others use them to lure prey. Cave dwelling larvae of Arachnocampa (Mycetophilidae, fungus gnats) glow to lure small flying insects into sticky strands of silk.|$|E
5|$|Although dragonflies are {{swift and}} agile fliers, some predators are {{fast enough to}} catch them. These include falcons such as the American kestrel, the merlin, and the hobby; nighthawks, swifts, flycatchers and {{swallows}} also take some adults; some species of wasps, too, prey on dragonflies, <b>using</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> provision their nests, laying an egg on each captured insect. In the water, various species of ducks and herons eat dragonfly larvae and they are also preyed on by newts, frogs, fish, and water spiders. Amur falcons, which migrate over the Indian Ocean at a period that coincides with the migration of the globe skimmer dragonfly, Pantala flavescens, may actually be feeding on them while on the wing.|$|E

5|$|Front {{tracking}} {{methods have}} long been used in fluid dynamics to model and track the motion of boundaries between different materials, of steep gradients in material properties such as weather fronts, or of shock waves within a single material. These methods involve deriving the equations of motion of the boundary, and <b>using</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> directly simulate {{the motion of the}} boundary, rather than simulating the underlying fluid and treating the boundary as an emergent property of the fluid. The same methods {{can also be used to}} simulate the curve-shortening flow, even when the curve undergoing the flow is not a boundary or shock.|$|E
5|$|Homeworld is a {{real-time}} strategy game set in space. Gameplay, {{as in most}} real-time strategy titles, {{is focused}} on gathering resources, building military forces, and <b>using</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> destroy enemy forces and accomplish an objective. The game includes both single-player and multiplayer modes; the single-player mode consists of one story-driven campaign, broken up into levels. In each level, the player has an objective to accomplish before they can end the level, though the ultimate objective of the mission can change as the level's story unfolds. Between each of the 16 levels is a hand-drawn, black-and-white cutscene with narrative voiceovers.|$|E
5|$|Hunting large whales {{usually takes}} several hours. Killer whales {{generally}} choose to attack young or weak animals; however, {{a group of}} five or more may attack a healthy adult. When hunting a young whale, a group chases it and its mother until they wear out. Eventually, they separate the pair and surround the calf, preventing it from surfacing to breathe, drowning it. Pods of female sperm whales sometimes protect themselves by forming a protective circle around their calves with their flukes facing outwards, <b>using</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> repel the attackers. Rarely, large killer whale pods can overwhelm even adult female sperm whales. Adult bull sperm whales, which are large, powerful and aggressive when threatened, and fully grown adult blue whales, which are possibly too large to overwhelm, are not believed to be prey for killer whales.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{upon his}} arrival in Germany, Accum went {{to the town of}} Althaldensleben. There, the {{industrialist}} Johann Gottlob Nathusius had acquired various estates and was <b>using</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> found a sprawling industrial settlement. Nathusius was a German pioneer in the field of sugar production from beets, and had established a factory for its production in that town between 1813 and 1816. It was probably Nathusius’ extensive library and chemical laboratory that drew Accum. He remained only a short time in Althaldensleben, however, as he soon got a professorship at the Gewerbeinstitut and the Bauakademie in Berlin. His teaching in the areas of physics, chemistry, and mineralogy, were collected in the two volume work, Physische und chemische Beschaffenheit der Baumaterialien, deren Wahl, Verhalten und zweckmässige Anwendung, published in Berlin in 1826. It was the only work Accum published originally in German.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was {{at peace with}} France and Spain {{and as a result}} the coastal defences {{received}} little attention; surveys reported multiple problems with Tilbury Fort including flooding caused by the estuary tides, and ferry passengers and animals making their way uninvited into the fort. In 1642 civil war broke out between the supporters of King Charles I and those of Parliament. Tilbury was controlled by Parliament, who placed the Tilbury and Gravesend forts under the command of a military governor, <b>using</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> control traffic entering London and to search for spies; it saw no military action during the war. Tilbury remained in use during the interregnum, having a garrison of three officers and sixty-six men in 1651.|$|E
5|$|Obsidian is an action-adventure {{computer}} {{game for the}} Amstrad CPC personal computer published by Artic Computing in 1986. The game is set on the titular space station located within the centre of an asteroid, which {{is out of control}} and drifting towards a black hole. The player must guide an astronaut with a jet pack around the station and re-activate its engine shields to prevent the Obsidian's destruction. This involves collecting items and <b>using</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> solve puzzles, while avoiding the Obsidian's reactivated security systems.|$|E

5|$|Several {{redundant}} locomotives {{were bought}} for preservation by Cliff Lawson of Tring. The group included three machines made by Ruston and Hornsby, two made by Hunslet, and two made by Lister. The eighth engine bought was the Diema, {{which was a}} hybrid made from the frames of two machines. Restoration involved splitting the components apart, and <b>using</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> rebuild both of the original locomotives, resulting in nine locomotives being preserved. Lawson re-gauged {{all of them to}} , and they have all been restored to working order. Lister 53977 was loaned to the Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The close {{distance}} between Mill Point and Point Lewis {{at the foot}} of Mount Eliza meant the site was suggested as a suitable location for a bridge as early as 1849. A bridge was proposed for the site in 1899, but its expected cost of £13,000 was deemed too high. Preliminary planning for a bridge at the site finally began in 1947, but was suspended so that a replacement, The Causeway, could be built at Heirisson Island, at the city's eastern end. The new Causeway bridges were opened in 1952, and by 1954 traffic <b>using</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> enter the city had doubled, renewing calls for a bridge at The Narrows.|$|E
5|$|The unusual {{behaviour}} of {{the bombers}} concerned Kapitän zur See Mecke. At 00:00 on 28 March, {{he issued a}} warning {{that there might be}} a parachute landing in progress. At 01:00 on 28 March, he followed up by ordering all guns to cease firing and searchlights to be extinguished in case the bombers were <b>using</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> locate the port. Everyone was placed on a heightened state of alert. The harbour defence companies and ships' crews were ordered out of the air raid shelters. During all this a lookout reported seeing some activity out at sea, so Mecke began suspecting some type of landing and ordered extra attention to be paid to the approaches to the harbour.|$|E

50|$|Tally {{counters}} {{have also}} been used in religion to count prayers, often replacing traditional prayer beads. Shri Vidya initiates often <b>use</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> {{keep track of the}} number of repetitions of the Mula Mantra into which they are initiated. Sikhs may <b>use</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> keep track of the number of times they chant the Mul Mantar. Buddhists {{have also been}} known <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> count mantras. Gaudiya Vaishnava Hindus may use tally counters {{to keep track of the}} number of times that they chant the Hare Krishna Mahamantra. Initiated devotees are required to chant a certain number of 'rounds' each day, each round consisting of 108 repetitions.|$|R
5|$|Today, {{the breed}} is used mainly for meat and logging forested areas {{inaccessible}} to machinery. Since the mid-1990s, colts not intended for breeding, recreational riding, or harness work are heavily fed and {{sent out to}} slaughter {{before the age of}} eighteen months. Fillies are generally used for breeding. The breed association and its breeders are trying to secure the future of the Trait du Nord by finding new markets, especially in the areas of recreational riding, agricultural work, recreational and competitive driving. The breed is involved in several reenactments and folk villages which attract good crowds. The breed is promoted for its use in logging in forests and fragile areas, with professional foresters <b>using</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> preserve the value and biodiversity of forested areas.|$|E
5|$|Before Crisis {{opens with}} the trainee Turks {{on a mission}} {{in the city of}} Midgar to {{investigate}} AVALANCHE activities. With help from Reno, AVALANCHE retreat. However, the attack proves to be a diversion for a greater strike at the town of Junon, where President Shinra is set to give a speech. President Shinra is shot, but survives, and calls in Sephiroth. However, it transpires that even the attack on the President was a diversion, and AVALANCHE's real target was a weapon called the Mako Cannon, which they planned to fire at Midgar, destroying the city. Elfé and Sephiroth do battle at the cannon, but the fight ends inconclusively, and AVALANCHE withdraw. AVALANCHE next target Rayleigh a professor carrying data on the SOLDIER members and their creation. The Turks are sent to protect Rayleigh, accompanied by several Shinra guards, including Cloud. Fuhito, a scientist working for AVALANCHE, is able to corrupt Rayleigh's data when the Turks disobey orders and save Rayleigh instead of protecting the information. Using the SOLDIER data, Fuhito develops an elite unit known as the Ravens, <b>using</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> capture two SOLDIERs, Essai and Sebastian. The Turks succeed in rescuing the pair, and are then sent to destroy AVALANCHE, accompanied by Zack. Essai and Sebastian, however, are captured once again, and turned into Ravens. Even though Zack is able to bring them back to their senses, he is unable to save them.|$|E
5|$|Detailed {{planning}} for the Tonga began in February, starting {{with the number of}} transport aircraft assigned to the operation being expanded rapidly to accommodate the entire division. Two Royal Air Force (RAF) air groups were provided for the operation to ensure that the division could be deployed in just two airlifts. The pilots and crew of these transport aircraft then began formation flying training and specialised aircrew training to ensure that they were as familiar with what the operation required of them. The 6th Airborne Division carried out several large-scale airborne exercises, <b>using</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> find {{the most efficient way to}} deploy a brigade group on one or multiple landing-zones. On 6 February, the 3rd Parachute Brigade undertook an exercise in which the entire brigade was dropped by 98 transport aircraft. At the end of March, 284 aircraft were used in Exercise 'Bizz II' in which the entire division was deployed by parachute or glider. Finally, between 21 April and 26 April, Exercise 'Mush' utilised approximately 700 aircraft to deploy the British 1st Airborne Division and the Polish 1st Parachute Brigade against the 6th Airborne Division, who moved by road, in a simulation of a full-scale airborne operation.|$|E
