50|$|His {{father was}} {{a teacher at the}} Vienna Polytechnic Institute. In 1856, he began to study lithography, but wasn't {{satisfied}} and switched to the Academy of Fine Arts where he remained until 1861, when his father was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>paying</b> his tuition and still support a large family.|$|R
5|$|Ochs's friends {{tried to}} help him. His brother Michael {{attempted}} to have him committed to a psychiatric hospital. Friends pleaded with him to get help voluntarily. They feared for his safety, because he was getting into fights with bar patrons. <b>Unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> his rent, he began living on the streets.|$|E
5|$|After the {{valuable}} coins were issued, Lépes demanded the tithe {{for the previous}} years in one sum. Historians estimate that the peasant families were required to pay six to nine gold florins, although {{the value of an}} average peasant lot was only about 40 florins. Most peasants were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> this amount, especially because they also had to pay the seigneurial taxes to the owners of their parcels.|$|E
5|$|In March 1866, a {{month after}} the fall, Eddy and her husband (then married for 13 years) moved into an unfurnished room in Lynn. At some point her husband left and Eddy was evicted, <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the $1.50 weekly rent. He appears to have {{returned}} briefly—they moved to a boarding house in July, and in August he paid Dr. Cushing's bill from the fall—but the marriage was over. He sent her $200 a year for a time, and they divorced in 1873.|$|E
60|$|Again the Woggle-Bug reluctantly {{abandoned}} a dollar; {{but the end}} was not yet.

Anderson served as Chair of the Litigation Section of the Utah State Bar Association (when the Litigation Section was recognized by the Utah Bar Association as the Section of the Year), and as president of Anderson and Karrenberg, a Salt Lake City law firm.|$|R
25|$|Gideon v. Wainwright, , is a {{landmark}} case in United States Supreme Court history. In it, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that states are required under the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to provide counsel {{in criminal cases}} to represent defendants who are <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> afford <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> their own attorneys. The case extended the right to counsel, which had been found under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to impose requirements on the federal government, by ruling that this right imposed those requirements upon the states as well.|$|R
5|$|Swakeleys manor, {{subordinate}} to Ickenham, {{was named after}} Robert Swalcliffe, who owned the manor with his wife Joan in the 14th century. He appears in records as Robert de Swalclyve and Robert de Wykeham, reflecting his ownership of Swakeleys and Wickham Park in Oxfordshire. In 1347, he owed £40 to a money lender, Roger Rikeman, which he was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> and so his land in Ickenham was passed by Rikeman in 1350 to John de Charlton.|$|E
5|$|The Dibbles' {{house was}} foreclosed around 1897 {{after they were}} <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> their taxes, and they moved to Portland, Oregon by 1900. It {{exchanged}} hands several times until 1917, when Gideon and Mary Hart Jones purchased it. The Jones family owned the house until 1933 (and notably added a kitchen which created the west wing of the house); thus, it was the Jones family who allowed Grant Wood to use their home as a backdrop for American Gothic.|$|E

Dr. Rollins attended Kreutzer until he was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>paying</b> the psychiatric bills.|$|R
5|$|The primary tax of {{this period}} was named bojakapati (grain tax) and charged for land used for cultivation. A water tax, named dakapati was also charged for the water used from reservoirs. Customs duties were also imposed in ports. Those <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> these taxes in cash were {{expected}} {{to take part in}} services such as repairing reservoirs. The administration of taxes was the duty of Badagarika, the king's treasurer.|$|E
5|$|Armed looters were {{observed}} entering the embassy compound {{as the final}} wave departed. The doors of the chancery—the main building of the embassy—were reportedly blown open by rocket-propelled grenades within two hours of the embassy's evacuation. Somali employees of the embassy—known as foreign service nationals (FSNs)—could not be evacuated. Local banks had been closed {{for some time and}} the embassy was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the FSNs. The Ambassador left the FSNs with keys to the commissary and warehouse on the embassy compound and they were permitted to take anything they needed.|$|E
5|$|As the {{libel suit}} against Marshall dragged on in Mercer County Circuit Court, Innes {{and his allies}} hired author William Littell to publish Innes' version of his {{interactions}} with Spain. Marshall countered by publishing his History of Kentucky in 1812. Although blatantly partisan, it became the most popular history of Kentucky at the time. When Street returned to Kentucky to give a deposition in the case in 1814, Innes swore out a writ against him to collect the damages awarded in his case against Street. <b>Unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> Street was imprisoned.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} deed of gift {{drawn up}} by Thomas Coats contained a proviso that if ever the Philosophical Institution should find itself <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for the upkeep of the Observatory it should be offered to Paisley Town Council, as the local authority was then.|$|R

5|$|Both the Two Tons and Sylvester came {{to suspect}} that Fantasy Records had failed to pay them {{all of the money}} that they were owed from the sale of their records. Sylvester left Fantasy and in November 1982 he filed a lawsuit against them; it {{ultimately}} proved successful in establishing that the company had been withholding money from him totaling $218,112.50. Nevertheless, Fuqua proved <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> anything more than $20,000, meaning that Sylvester never saw the majority of the money that was legally owed to him. Sylvester grew to despise Fuqua, and forbade his friends from ever mentioning his name.|$|E
5|$|By 1911, {{the owner}} Major Richard Winstanley was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for the upkeep {{of the castle}} and, {{concerned}} about its deteriorating condition, proposed placing the property into the guardianship of the Commissioners of Works. Following {{a survey by the}} architect Sir Frank Baines, which showed the ruins to need immediate repairs, the Commissioners took over the castle the following year. It was restored by Sir Charles Peers, the Inspector of Ancient Monuments, between 1912 and 1913. He stripped away any remains of the farm, cleared the vegetation from the walls and repaired the brickwork, re-cutting the moat and reconstructing a replica of the medieval bridge.|$|E

The owner of the Springfield Ponies of the Eastern League attempted to convince Tinker to manage his team in 1931. Tinker assumed managerial duties of the Orlando Gulls in mid-May 1937, succeeding Nelson Leach. However, he resigned the position in July of that year, as the team was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> his salary. During World War II, Tinker worked at Orlando Air Force Base as a boiler inspector.|$|E

There was a $600,000 spending limit. Liberal riding associations {{in each of the}} province's 125 ridings were to select 24 delegates between February 4 and March 10, 2013. The party was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> afford <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> delegates' travel expenses. Instead, the candidates themselves were allowed to reimburse the delegates. There were 5 debates, including one entirely in English. The rules and timeline were formally adopted on October 21, 2012, the day before the official start of the campaign.|$|R
5|$|In 1956, Johnson's life's {{work was}} almost {{destroyed}} when his caretaker declared him <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> further storage fees. Instead, Helen Harriton, Mary Beattie Brady, and others arranged {{with the court}} to have Johnson's belongings delivered to the Harmon Foundation with unconditional rights over all works. The foundation would use the works to advance interracial understanding and support African American achievements in the fine arts. On April 19, 1967, the Harmon Foundation gave more than 1,000 paintings, watercolors, and prints by Johnson to the Smithsonian American Art Museum.|$|E
5|$|In {{the small}} town of Champaner (in the state of Gujarat, western India) {{during the height of the}} British empire in India in 1893, Captain Andrew Russell (Paul Blackthorne), the {{commanding}} officer of the Champaner cantonment, has imposed high taxes ("Lagaan") on people from the local villages that they are <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> due to a prolonged drought.

5|$|The Turnpike Commission {{announced}} plans to consider eliminating manned toll booths in favor of all-electronic tolls. With this, tolls will be paid using either E-ZPass or credit cards. Drivers <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> by either of these methods will be billed in the mail using license plate recognition; an additional surcharge will be applied. In addition to E-ZPass, the turnpike commission offered other automated options to pay for tolls such as using a prepaid account that utilizes license plate recognition. McCormick Taylor and Wilbur Smith Associates have been hired to conduct a feasibility study on converting the road to all-electronic tolls.|$|E
50|$|Eleven {{years before}} the Manual by-law, there was an earlier concept of reading room and a dispensary of {{literature}} and services for those <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> afford <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for Christian Science treatment or transportation to a Christian Science church. In Boston, these efforts were halted in 1894 to concentrate on building the original Mother Church.|$|R
50|$|Mulatto {{domination}} {{of politics and}} economics after the revolution created another two-caste society, as most Haitians were rural subsistence farmers. In addition, the nascent state's future was compromised in 1825 when France forced it <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> 150 million gold francs in reparations to French ex-slaveholders—as a condition of French recognition and to end the nation's political and economic isolation. Though {{the amount of the}} reparations was reduced in 1838, Haiti was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> finish <b>paying</b> off its debt until 1947, and the payments left the country's government deeply impoverished, causing instability.|$|R
