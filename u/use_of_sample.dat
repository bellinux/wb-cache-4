5|$|Noted for its <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> {{loop and}} {{utilizing}} swing note and synthesized percussion throughout its production, the album encompasses {{a variety of}} musical styles, such as new jack swing, hard rock, pop, dance and industrial music. The songs range from mechanized dance rhythms to soft balladry, giving it appeal across multiple radio formats. It became the singer's second consecutive album to skyrocket to {{number one on the}} Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States. Certified six-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), it became the country's best-selling album of 1990 and has sold an estimated 12 million copies worldwide. Due to its innovative production and lyrical exploration, critics have come to regard it as the pinnacle of Jackson's artistic achievement. It has been cited as an influence in various musical trends, inspiring numerous artists.|$|E

5000|$|In statistics, point {{estimation}} involves the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> data to calculate a single value (known as a statistic) {{which is to}} serve as a [...] "best guess" [...] or [...] "best estimate" [...] of an unknown (fixed or random) population parameter.|$|E

The chorus sampled American jazz drummer Idris Muhammads 1977 song [...] "Could Heaven Ever Be Like This". This <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> was said by Thumps Angus Harrison as [...] "particularly poignant" [...] when Muhammads death was less than a year ago.|$|E
50|$|In statistics, {{interval}} estimation is the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> data to calculate an interval of possible (or probable) values {{of an unknown}} population parameter, in contrast to point estimation, which is a single number. Jerzy Neyman (1937) identified {{interval estimation}} ("estimation by interval") as distinct from point estimation ("estimation by unique estimate"). In doing so, he recognised that then-recent work quoting results {{in the form of}} an estimate plus-or-minus a standard deviation indicated that interval estimation was actually the problem statisticians really had in mind.|$|E
50|$|Some samples use a biased {{statistical}} design which nevertheless {{allows the}} estimation of parameters. The U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, for example, deliberately oversamples from minority populations in many of its nationwide surveys {{in order to gain}} sufficient precision for estimates within these groups. These surveys require the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> weights (see later on) to produce proper estimates across all ethnic groups. Provided that certain conditions are met (chiefly that the weights are calculated and used correctly) these samples permit accurate estimation of population parameters.|$|E

5000|$|The {{industry}} standard became an IEEE standard in 1990 as IEEE Std. 1149.1-1990 {{after many years}} of initial use. In the same year, Intel released their first processor with JTAG (the 80486) which led to quicker industry adoption by all manufacturers. In 1994, a supplement that contains a description of the boundary scan description language (BSDL) was added. Further refinements regarding the use of all-zeros for EXTEST, separating the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>SAMPLE</b> from PRELOAD and better implementation for OBSERVE_ONLY cells were made and released in 2001. [...] Since 1990, this standard has been adopted by electronics companies around the world. Boundary scan is now mostly synonymous with JTAG, but JTAG has essential uses beyond such manufacturing applications.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{has been}} remixed three times, {{resulting}} each {{time in new}} interest in both the original and the Boy Meets Girl duo. The dance outfit Cabin Crew originally remixed the song as [...] "Star to Fall" [...] (a.k.a. [...] "Star2Fall"), but were refused <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> of the original lyrics by SonyBMG. Liking what Cabin Crew had done, however, George Merrill agreed to re-record the vocals for their version, so it may actually be counted {{as more of a}} cover than a remix. Cabin Crew's version made number 4 in the UK charts in March 2005. Meanwhile, SonyBMG had Sunset Strippers remix the original track under the title [...] "Falling Stars," [...] which was released a week after the Cabin Crew version, and made number 3 in the UK charts. This caused some confusion at the time, with two songs being released into the charts around the same time that sounded essentially the same.|$|E
