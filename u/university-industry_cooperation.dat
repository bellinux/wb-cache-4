40|$|Research {{universities}} are a recent innovation, having emerged in Prussia {{in the early}} 19 th century, and in the United States only {{in the aftermath of}} the Civil War. By 1940, perhaps a dozen American universities could be regarded as firstclass research institutions. However, they received virtually no financial support from the US government. The most farreaching recommendation of Vannevar Bush’s famous July 1945 report, Science—the Endless Frontier, was that it was in the nation’s best interest for the federal government to fund university research. From 1950 through the mid- 1970 s, such federal support expanded rapidly, resulting in the flowering of the American academic research system, but was accompanied by a decline in industrial support. Beginning in the late 1970 s, several federal agencies established largely successful programs to encourage <b>university–industry</b> research <b>cooperation</b> as a means of reestablishing links between universities and industry. Other countries have tried to replicate the success of US research universities, but with limited results. Yet despite the success of US universities, they face a number of significant challenges. The record of the past 60 years suggests that they can continue to remain at the forefront in the search for knowledge, but only if they, and the wider US public, understand and are prepared to deal with these challenges...|$|R

40|$|The {{establishment}} {{and growth of}} industrial research laboratories {{is one of the}} key organizational innovations affecting technological progress in the United States in the 20 th century. In this paper, we investigate the rise of industrial research laboratories in the U. S. pharmaceutical industry between 1927 and 1946. Our evidence suggests that institutional factors, namely the presence of universities dedicated to research, played a significant role in the {{establishment and}} diffusion of private pharmaceutical research laboratories. Specifically, we document that the growth of industrial pharmaceutical laboratories between 1927 and 1946 is positively and significantly correlated with the extent of local university research, after controlling for other observable factors likely to influence the geographic distribution of industrial research. We supplement our core results with case histories illustrative of early university-industry interaction and an examination of the determinants of <b>university-industry</b> research <b>cooperation.</b> Our qualitative historical evidence and analyses of the birth of chemical engineering programs suggest that industry also played a role in influencing university research agendas. We correct for feedback effects from industry to universities using instrumental variables. Overall, our analyses suggest that while the presence of industrial facilities helped shape the direction of university research programs, there was a significant, positive, and causal effect running from university research to the growth of pharmaceutical research laboratories in the first half of the twentieth century in the United States. ...|$|R
40|$|In Malaysia, {{there is}} a profusion of {{evidence}} of high graduate unemployment since many graduates are found lacking of what are needed to acquire and to maintain their jobs. In this paper, graduate employability skills were analyzed based on four major criteria: qualification, academic score, experience and specific soft skills. The data and information used were extracted from 300 online job advertisements accessed via electronic databases at [URL] from January to March 2011. A simple checklist form was developed to quantify the information from ads into quantitative data that was later keyed in the Statistical Package for Social Science for descriptive analyses. Based on the data, {{it was concluded that}} graduates with bachelor degrees {{were more likely to be}} employable due to high demand. It was also found that academic excellence based on CGPA was not the utmost factor for graduate employability. However, since less than one-third ads were free from work experiences requirement, fresh graduates only secured a little chance to be recruited. Another factor that limited graduates employability was high demand of specific soft skills requested by employers, among which were graduates with high quality of communication/interpersonal skills, foreign language proficiency, ICT/technical skills, high spirit of teamwork and specific personal attributes. Results concluded that graduate unemployment rate will continue to increase unless the Higher Education Institution (HEI) and the graduates are prepared to sharpen their soft skills according to market niche. It is suggested that the HEI work more closely with industries, professional bodies and society through the establishment of <b>university-industry</b> link <b>cooperation</b> that will become a catalyst for soft skills enhancement...|$|R

The distinctive {{nature of the}} parties involved parts makes it important for one to complement {{the interests of the}} other. Therefore, it is a fundamental aspect {{that there should be a}} precise exchange of information between the company and academia. In this context, studying the communication process is highly relevant in order to achieve a satisfactory relationship between the partners involved in the agreement. The aim of this study is to characterize the communication process in a technological <b>cooperation</b> between <b>university-industry</b> during the phases of cooperation development. The study consists of qualitative research of a descriptive-exploratory nature, which made use of multiple studies. The cooperation cases under study involved agreements between companies and the Federal Universities of Paraná, and the results of the analyses show exchanges of specific messages for each phase of the cooperative process and a variety of medias that were adapted to the messages. Although the insertion of more modern ways of communication can be seen, conventional means of communication are still in use. The interface structures are highlighted, a characteristic feature of the type of agreement under study.

40|$|O tema da gestão da inovação e transferência de tecnologia (TT) no contexto de interação universidade-empresa é relativamente novo no Brasil e emergente em âmbito internacional (REISMAN, 2005), assim, seus dados e teorias ainda se apresentam de modo fragmentado. Considerando essa fragilidade, este estudo objetivou identificar e analisar pesquisas recentes publicadas no Brasil sobre o tema, buscando contribuir para a consolidação desse corpo teórico. O trabalho, de cunho exploratório, revisou as pesquisas publicadas em periódicos nacionais entre 2005 e 2009, sob uma abordagem qualitativa. Os objetivos, métodos e principais resultados desses estudos foram sintetizados e discutidos. A análise coletiva desses trabalhos sugere que a cooperação universidade-empresa (U-E) gera inovações, aprendizados e benefícios mútuos. Esta aponta ainda existir muito espaço para ampliar a transferência de tecnologia U-E. O estudo identificou os métodos usados nas pesquisas; motivadores, facilitadores e obstáculos ao processo; elementos das estruturas universitárias, bem como políticas das IES e do governo intervenientes no processo; características de empresas geradas a partir de spillovers acadêmicos; o papel social exercido pelas IES; diferentes formas de TT na interação U-E; lacunas de pesquisas e sugestões para a realização de estudos futuros. Innovation {{management}} and technology transfer (TT) {{in the context}} of university-industry interaction is a relatively new topic in Brazil and an emerging field internationally (REISMAN, 2005); thus, the data and theories related to it are still presented in a fragmented way. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify and analyze recent studies published in Brazil on the subject seeking to contribute to the consolidation of this theoretical framework. This exploratory study reviewed articles published in national journals between 2005 and 2009 using a qualitative approach. The goals, methods, and main results of these studies were summarized and discussed. The collective analysis of the studies suggests that <b>university-industry</b> (U-I) <b>cooperation</b> generates innovation, learning, and mutual benefits. It also indicates that there is still plenty of room for growth in U-I technology transfer. The literature review identified methods used in the studies, motivators, facilitators, and constraints of the process, structural characteristics and policies of universities, as well as government policies that affect the process, characteristics of firms created from academic spillovers, the social role played by universities, different forms of TT, research gaps, and suggestions for future studies...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge {{production}} has changed considerably {{in the past}} few decades. This transformation has notably affected universities both as unique institutions and citadels of knowledge. These changes are being brought by a number of factors, such as the globalization of the economy, the rise of technologies based on generic forms of knowledge, and the ability of universities to hold and exploit patents. In both scale and intensity, these alterations have led policy makers to reflect more on how scientific and technological innovation can and should be enhanced by policy decisions that would improve <b>university-industry</b> and government <b>cooperation.</b> This new fusion of three complementary societal sectors has been described by sociologists as the triple helix. As an analytical and normative concept, the triple helix is derived from the changing role of government in different societies in relation to academia and industry. Its basis is the recognition that the interaction among university-industry-government as relatively independent, yet inter-dependent institutional spheres is critical to improving the conditions for innovation in a knowledge-based society. The study reveals that commercial research funding significantly affects the perceptions of university-industry collaboration and academic knowledge capitalization. The analysis showed that academic scientists who received commercial research funding have relatively positive views about university-industry relations than those who do not receive such funds. However, one cannot conclude that commercial activities of academic scientists are harming the core functions of the university or that intellectual autonomy is being surrendered to industrial partners. Based on the findings of the study, and the contours of the triple helix model, it is argued that the growth of university-industry-government collaboration is not necessarily pre-determined in favour of either private corporations or the state, nor is it necessarily at the expense of universities. It is further contended that the growing notion that academic capitalism is harming the core functions of the university is perhaps a bit simplistic in that the issue is more complex and multifaceted than usually acknowledged. In light of the above, the study asserts that the future viability of policies encouraging universities to be entrepreneurial may, if approached strategically, be catalysts for the science-based knowledge economy. For that to be realistic there is the need to understand the university as a ‘differentiated social system’ rather than a ‘unified whole’. This will avoid the situation whereby all university activities are subordinated under a homogenous policy of one size fits all. In the context of triple helix relations, conceptualizing the university as a ‘differentiated social system’ means a deep-seated and continually growing purposeful specialization such as the adoption of an economic development function in addition to teaching, research and community engagement...|$|R

The research was of an exploratory and qualitative nature and its methodology was based on multiple case studies. As instruments of data collection, semi-structured interviews were conducted, supported by documental secondary data. The contentfor analysis was obtained from interviews and documentary analysis of secondary data. Field research was conducted with representatives of companies in the technology park Tecnopuc and with university researchers within PUC-RS, and comprised of three selected processes of cooperation, following six interviews. As a result, the conceptual model application allowed for the observation that there are still elements that can be added to the taxonomy proposed in respect of drivers, barriers/facilitators and the characterization of <b>university-industry</b> <b>cooperation.</b> The results demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} recognize the importance of informal ties occurring within the space and technology park and to demonstrate the conceptual model developed as a framework to be applied in future studies on the subject of <b>university-industry</b> <b>cooperation...</b>|$|E

40|$|At a {{time when}} {{universities}} have gained {{a central role in}} the society as producers of knowledge, innovations and national competitiveness, they are facing several challenges for their mission and role in the 2010 s. Society and national governments have growing requirements for universities, in addition to their traditional dual role as makers of research and providers of higher education, in the form of a so-called 'third mission'. Fulfilling this mission is increasingly tied to connections with industry and business. The objective of this study is to describe <b>university-industry</b> <b>cooperation</b> in Aalto University, the nature of the collaboration, the leading principles and drivers behind it, and the realised outcomes. The aim is to describe the objectives and the reasoning behind the management actions as well as the process and actors of corporate stakeholder management. The outputs are recommendations for managing corporate stakeholders and industry collaboration in Aalto University. This study is conducted as a case study using Aalto University as the case of <b>university-industry</b> <b>cooperation.</b> The data is constituted of 18 interviews and organisational documents from Aalto University. The interviews are analysed with content analysis and compared with the strategy of the university and internal CR documents. There are four general principles that describe how <b>university-industry</b> <b>cooperation</b> is managed in Aalto University: Quality research and education as the basis for the cooperation; professors as the central actors; the project approach for industry relations; and long-term win-win partnerships as the objective for industry cooperation. In addition, there are three themes - resources, interaction and internationalisation - that cut through and contribute to all of the principles. The importance of cooperation, mutual trust, respect, good shared experiences and professional collegiality form the basis for successful partnerships. Mutual interests and benefits, committed top management, interdependency, compatibility, and industry's power to advance a university's mission are qualities of strategic and long-term partnerships. Win-win partnerships are capable to create value for both the university and the industry partner, and to contribute to the goals of the university of high quality research and education, societal impact as well as for brand building...|$|E
