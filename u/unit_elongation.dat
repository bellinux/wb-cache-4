The eutectic crystallising in Fe-C-V alloys is composed of ferrite and vanadium carbides of the VC 1 -x type, and as such {{is included in the}} group of fibrous eutectics. Introducing silicon additions to the Fe-C-V system changes the geometry of the solidifying eutectic from fibrous to complex regular, and the shape of primary carbides from non-faceted dendrites to the faceted ones. It has been proved that the tensile strength Rm, proof stress R 0, 2, <b>unit</b> <b>elongation</b> A 5 and hardness HV 30 depend mainly on the type of alloy matrix. It has also been proved that adding silicon to Fe-C-V alloys may increase the hardness HV 30 by about 24 % and the tensile strength Rm by as much as 40 %, with simultaneous 80 % reduction of the <b>unit</b> <b>elongation</b> A 5...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{constitutes}} {{the culmination of}} the foregoing investigations concerning the influence of short carbon fibre on the enhancement of AlMg 10 alloy properties. The presented work brings forward the results of examinations of mechanical and tribological properties of metal matrix composites (MMCs) based on this alloy. Composites were produced by two methods: either by gravity casting or by squeeze casting in semi-solid state of a composite suspension previously obtained through mixing of its components. The volume fraction of the reinforcing phase varied and took the value of 5, or 10, or finally 15 vol. %. Specimens cut out of the experimental castings were examined with respect both to their mechanical properties, i. e. the tensile strength and <b>unit</b> <b>elongation,</b> and to their tribological behaviour. A series of examinations of the mechanical properties proved a slight increase in tensile strength and a minor decrease in <b>unit</b> <b>elongation</b> of the examined composite materials both for gravity cast and squeeze cast specimens, as compared with the properties of pure matrix alloy. The introduction of short carbon fibre into the matrix alloy resulted also in the increased abrasive wear resistance of the examined composites in comparison to the non-reinforced matrix...|$|E

The fraction of home scrap in the metal charge ranged from 0 to 100 %. Castings were pressure cast by means of the hot-chamber pressure die casting machine under the industrial conditions in one of the domestic foundries. The examinations consisted in the determination of the following properties: tensile strength Rm, yield strength Rp 0. 2, and the <b>unit</b> <b>elongation</b> A 5, all being measured during the static tensile test. Also, the hardness measurements were taken by the Brinell method. It was found that the mechanical properties (mainly the strength properties) are being improved up to the home scrap fraction of 50 %. Their values were increased by about 30 % over this range. Further rise in the home scrap content, however, brought a definite decrease in these properties.

Prior to the main test, the optimal pre-fixed load corresponding to the highest power output was selected following a random series of six 10 -s sprints. Surface electromyographic (EMG) signals were detected from the right vastus lateralis with linear adhesive arrays of eight electrodes. Power output decreased significantly from 6 -s {{until the end of the}} test (860. 9 +/- 207. 8 vs. 360. 9 +/- 11. 4 W, respectively) and was correlated with MFCV (R = 0. 543, P < 0. 01), which also declined significantly by 26. 8 +/- 11 % (P < 0. 05). There was a tendency for the mean frequency of the EMG power spectrum (MNF) to decrease, but average rectified values (ARV) remained unchanged throughout the test.

We have shown previously that the yeast genes HPR 1 and THO 2 may be keys to the understanding of transcription-associated recombination, as they both affect transcription elongation and hyper-recombination in a concerted manner. Using a yeast strain that has the wild-type THO 2 gene replaced by one encoding a His 6 -HA-tagged version, we have isolated an oligomeric complex containing four proteins: Tho 2, Hpr 1, Mft 1 and a novel protein that we have named Thp 2. We have reciprocally identified a complex containing Hpr 1, Tho 2 and Mft 1 using anti-Mft 1 antibodies in immunoprecipitation experiments. The protein complex is mainly nuclear; therefore, Tho 2 and Hpr 1 are physically associated. Like hpr 1 Δ and tho 2 Δ cells, mft 1 Δ and thp 2 Δ cells show mitotic hyper- recombination and impaired transcription elongation, in particular, through the bacterial lacZ sequence. Hyper-recombination conferred by mft 1 Δ and thp 2 Δ is only observed in DNA regions under transcription conditions.

All the castings were made of AlSi 11 alloy modified with strontium. For a purpose of comparison also castings made of the non-modified alloy were produced. The castings were examined with regard to their microstructures. The performed investigations point out that the addition of strontium master alloy results in refining of the alloy structure, particularly of the α-phase, causes some morphological changes in the alloy and the refinement of eutectics. The advantageous influence of modifier on the structure of the examined silumin was observed particularly in the case of alloy cast either in the conventional oil-bound sand mould or in the shell mould.

40|$|Plant cells {{appear to}} have at least two fatty acid forming systems, which occur in {{distinct}} subcellular compartments: plastids and mitochondria. Mitochondrial fatty acid synthase (mtFAS) is a Type II system that utilizes individual enzymes to catalyze the iterative reactions. Many of the mtFAS components have yet to be identified, and physiological functions of mtFAS are still poorly understood. In this dissertation, we characterized five Arabidopsis mtFAS components, namely mitochondrial beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (mtKAS), mitochondrial 3 -hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase (mtHD), mitochondrial enoyl-ACP reductase (mtER), mitochondrial phosphopantetheinyl transferase (mtPPT), and mitochondrial malonyl-CoA synthetase (mtMCS). MtKAS, mtHD, and mtER catalyze 3 of the 4 reactions of the acyl chain elongation cycle; mtPPT is responsible for activating mitochondrial acyl carrier protein (mtACP) by the addition of a phosphopantetheine cofactor; and mtMCS generates malonyl-CoA, the donor of 2 -carbon <b>elongation</b> <b>unit</b> for the mtFAS system. Mitochondrial octanoyl-ACP is the precursor for the synthesis of lipoic acid, which is the coenzyme of H-subunit of glycine decarboxylase complex (GDC), a key enzyme of photorespiration. Accordingly, mutations in the mtFAS system lead to a typical deficiency in photorespiration due to the depletion of the lipoylation of H-subunit of GDC. Lipid profiles in these mutants are also altered as a secondary effect of the deficiency in photorespiration. In addition, mutant analyses demonstrate that mitochondrial 3 -hydroxymyristyl-ACP contributes to the biosynthesis of lipid A-like molecules, suggesting a novel synthetic destination of the mtFAS intermediates. RNA-seq transcriptomic analyses of the mutants establish a regulatory network that is associated with the mtFAS functions. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the mtFAS system has multiple functionalities and is crucial for plant metabolic homeostasis...|$|R
40|$|Results of {{previous}} research on whole-cell cultures of Penicillium chrysogenum have suggested that acetyl CoA, without being converted to malonyl CoA, supplies the two carbon <b>units</b> for the <b>elongation</b> of palmitic acid. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the mode of elongation of 1 -t 4 C palmityl CoA by a 20, 000 x g mitochondrial pellet from P. chrysogenum. Acetyl CoA or malonyl CoA was incubated with radioactivelylabeled palmityl CoA for 20 minutes. Avidin was added to some experimental reaction mixtures. The resulting fatty acids were saponified, extracted with hexane, methylated with diazomethane, and purified by thin layer chromatography. The methyl esters were separated and identified by gas-liquid chromatography. The radioactivity of each methyl ester was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Elongation of palmityl CoA was observed in the presence of acetyl CoA, but not in the presence of malonyl CoA. The addition avidin produced a greater proportion of short-chained fatty acidsthe expense of palmitic acid, but did not decrease the percentage of long-chained fatty acids produced. A high proportion of label was recovered in the C 18 : 3 fatty acid, linolenic acid. This suggested that two pathways of linolenic acid synthesis may be operating in this organism. Methods for detection and control of cancer encompass a large area of today's research. Recent use of granulomas as a model for such detection and control may be a promising field, especially for monitoring tumor antigens and immune responses. These granuloma systems are increasingly becoming vehicles in the study of tumor immunology. Although granulomas may be induced naturally by means of foreign bodies i. e. viral, fungal, or bacterial agents, new methods are being established to produce artificial granuloma systems. These systems include chemical or foreign body implantations followed by tumor vaccine challenges. The research presented here involved the use of a golf ball-induced granuloma for the purpose of establishment of a detection system for immune responses. The use of a golf ball-induced granuloma provided a closed system for monitoring cell-mediated and humoral responses to tumor antigens. Immune responses were monitored by means of hematocrits (packed blood cell counts), white blood cell differential counts, and electrophoretic results. Hematocrit results indicated no great immune response to the closed vaccine injected granulomasystems. Observations made on differential white blood cell counts indicated decreasing neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios for cellular immune responses. Electrophoretic results for granuloma fluids indicated decreases in albumin levels concurrent with increases in peak two,and complete loss of peak three following vaccination. Responses to tumor specific antigens in the form of cell-mediated immune responses are indicated by the results presented in this research. Utilization of the golf ball-induced granuloma system provided a means of separating the cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. Tumor specific antigens elicited various immune responses and provide hope for future identification of tumors by this method. Future development and utilization of the golf ball-induced granuloma system may be potential means of monitoring cell-mediated immune responses to tumor malignancies. Thesis (M. S. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Aim: Elastic tendons {{have been}} {{suggested}} to attenuate fascicle lengthening during eccentric contractions; however, there is no in vivo evidence to sup-port this hypothesis. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to determine whether patella tendon stiffness modulates vastus lateralis (VL) fascicle lengthening during eccentric contractions in males and females. Method: Vastus lateralis and patella tendon properties were measured in males and females owing to previously reported intrinsic gender differences in tendon properties. During maximal voluntary eccentric knee extensions, VL fascicle lengthening and torque were recorded at every 10 ° (range of motion 20 – 90 °). Results: A significant correlation between maximal pa tella tendon stiffnessand change in fascicle length (r = 0. 476, P = 0. 023) was observed. Similarly,there was a significant correlation between maximal Young’s modulus andchange in fascicle length (r = 0. 470, P = 0. 049). As expected, patella tendon stiffness and Young’s modulus were significantly higher in males compared with females (P < 0. 05). Interestingly, change in VL fascicle length during the eccentric contractions was significantly greater in males compared with females (P < 0. 05). Based on patella tendon moment arm measurements, VL muscle-tendon <b>unit</b> <b>elongation</b> was estimated to be significantly greater in males compared with females (5. 24 and 4. 84 cm respectively). Conclusion: The significant difference in fascicle lengthening during eccentric contractions may be partly explained by the significantly higher patella tendon moment arm, patella tendon stiffness and Young’s modulus found in males compared with females. The current study provides in vivo evidence to support the hypothesis that the tendon acts as a ‘mechanical buffer’ during eccentric contractions.

Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on O-deacylated LOS from H. ducreyi ITM 5535 obtained after treatment with anhydrous hydrazine gave evidence {{for the presence of}} a sialylated major compound, Neu 5 Ac alpha(2 [...] > 3) -beta-D-Galp-(1 [...] > 4) -beta-D-GlcNAcp-(1 [...] > 3) -beta-D-Gal p- (1 [...] > 4) -D-alpha-D-Hepp-(1 [...] > 6) -beta-D-Glcp-(1 [...] >[L-alpha-D-Hepp -(1 [...] > 2) -L- alpha-D-Hepp-(1 [...] > 3) ] 4) -L-alpha-D-Hepp-Kdo(P) -O-deacylated lipid A (Neu 5 Ac stands for N-acetylneuraminic acid). However, an even larger oligosaccharide could be isolated from all strains as a minor component, viz., the undecasaccharide beta-D-Galp-(1 [...] > 4) -beta-D-GlcNAcp-(1 [...] > 3) -beta-d-Galp-(1 [...] > 4) -beta-D-glcNAcp-(1 [...] > 3) -beta-D-Galp-(1 [...] > 4) -D-alpha-D-Hepp-(1 [...] > 6) -beta-D-Glcp-(1 [...] >[L-alpha-D-Hepp-(1 [...] > 2) -L-alpha-D-Hepp-(1 [...] > 3) ] 4 -L-alpha-D-Hepp-Kdo, which represents an N-acetyl lactosamine disaccharide <b>unit</b> <b>elongation</b> of the LOS outer core. No Sialylation of this latter minor component undecasaccharide was detected...|$|E
