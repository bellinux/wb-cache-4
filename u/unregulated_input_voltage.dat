In applications requiring DC-DC conversion from a high input voltage, the buck regulator dramatically improves conversion efficiency relative to linear regulator alternatives. However, applying the buck regulator to applications with high input-to-output step-down ratios creates significant challenges for the pulse-width modulation (PWM) controller. Because the duty cycle of the buck regulator switch is approximately equal to VOUT/VIN, a buck DC-DC converter with high input/output voltage ratio must control very narrow PWM pulses. The switching frequency of a buck regulator is generally set to a high level {{to reduce the size}} of the inductor and capacitors. High switching frequency and low duty cycle translates to very short pulse durations in the controller. For example, a buck regulator with an input voltage of 66 V and an output voltage of 3. 3 V will require a buck switch duty cycle of approximately 5 %. At a typical switching frequency of 300 kHz, the required PWM on-time of the buck switch is a mere 166 ns. Control methods or topologies used in buck regulators include Voltage-NEXT ISSUE...|$|E

Employing the advantages of a switch-mode voltage regulator in 0. 18 Âµm CMOS technology, a power supply has been designed for a complete System-on-Chip (SoC). While offering enough drive capability for the entire system, the supply provides an extra highly-regulated output for noise-sensitive analog blocks.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedSpace power supply manufacturers {{have tried to}} increase power density and construct smaller, highly efficient power supplies by increasing switching frequency. Incorporation of a power MOSFET as a switching element alleviates switching loss. However, values of R sub DS(on) (drain-to-source resistance in the on-state) for MOSFET's are of such magnitude to produce greater on-state losses than an equivalent BJT operated in saturation. This research serves to introduce a design concept, pertinent to low-voltage relatively-high-current applications, that minimizes the peak current through the switching element {{in order to reduce}} average power loss. Basic waveforms produced by different PWM and resonant mode topologies were examined. Theoretical analysis reveals that a ramp-sine current waveform could cut conduction power loss by at least 18 % over a conventional Buck switching converter.

At each step in this process, the approximation is stored in a successive approximation register (SAR). For example, consider an <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> of 6.3 V and the initial range is 0 to 16 V. For the first step, the input 6.3 V is compared to 8 V (the midpoint of the 0-16 V range).
