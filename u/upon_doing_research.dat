50|$|Margi Preus is an American {{writer who}} specializes in {{children}} books and playwrights. She also writes comic plays, adaptations, libretto and short fiction. Preus has directed Colder by the Lake Comedy Theatre for twenty years in Duluth, Minnesota. She graduated from Binghamton University, SUNY. She is a children’s literature instructor at the College of St. Scholastica, school of Education, and University of Minnesota-Duluth in her leisure time. Preus discovered Manjiro’s true story <b>upon</b> <b>doing</b> <b>research</b> for her previous picture book, The Peace Bell, at the local library in Japan. She was attracted by the courage of a poor teenage fisherman, who overcame hardship during a ten-year journey exploring America with a dramatic end being awarded an unlikely honorable title as Samurai, a royal honor by inheritance. Manjiro is believed the first Japanese to set foot in America. The book highlights the peace and friendship between two nations on a civil level.Preus's other books are West of the Moon in 2014 (for ages 9-12), Shadow on the Mountain in 2012, Celebritrees: Historic & Famous Trees of the World in 2011 (for ages 4-8). The Peace Bell in 2008 (ages 4-8). Preus had previously published several books long before her name became recognizable. She wrote Visions in Near-Sleep in 1983, and had co-authored with Lise Lunge Larsen for a picture book, Legend of the Lady Slipper in 1999 (ages 4-8). She had co-authored with Ann Treacy for Sacred Words: A Collection of Prayers from Around the World in 2001 as well as co-edited together for A Book of Grace in 2002 (for young adult to adult).|$|E

The current functionality of our cleaner is very limited, but some initial data suggests that performance scales linearly {{with the amount of}} data to be cleaned. 1 Introduction Our original intentions for this project were to port Margo Seltzer's code for a log-structured file system from BSD Unix to Linux. <b>Upon</b> <b>doing</b> some web <b>research,</b> however, we discovered that an implementation effort was already underway by a student named Christian Czezatke at the Technical University of Vienna. He had created a prototype of a log-structured file system for Linux called DTFS, but it lacked some important features. Most notable was the lack of a cleaner to reclaim file blocks that have become garbage as a result of file writes or deletion. After communicating [...] ...|$|R

40|$|How does status {{consumption}} operate {{among the}} middle classes in less industrialized countries (LICs) -those classes that have the spending power to participate effectively in consumer culture? Globalization research suggests that Bourdieu's status consumption model, based <b>upon</b> Western <b>research,</b> <b>does</b> not provide an adequate explanation. And {{what we call the}} global trickle-down model, often invoked to explain LIC status consumption, is even more imprecise. We study the status consumption strategies of upper-middle-class Turkish women in order to revise three of Bourdieu's most important concepts-cultural capital, habitus, and consumption field-to propose a theory specific to the LIC context. We demonstrate that cultural capital is organized around orthodox practice of the Western Lifestyle myth, that cultural capital is deterritorialized and so accrues through distant textbook-like learning rather than via the habitus, and that the class faction with lower cultural capital indigenizes the consumption field to sustain a national social hierarchy.

40|$|Using {{self-control}} is {{like using}} a muscle that can become fatigued (Rounding, Jacobson, 2 ̆ 6 Ji, 2011). Daily, people undergo ego-depleting tasks, like waiting in traffic, which means their resources for self-control diminish {{as the day}} and week continues. The effects ego-depletion can be detrimental because {{researchers have found that}} lack of self-control reduces endurance through unpleasant tasks, and it reduces forgiveness (Rounding, et al., 2012; Balliet 2 ̆ 6 Joireman, 2011). Also, Rounding, et al. (2012) found that priming ego-depleted participants with religion concepts reloads their self-control resources, allowing further endurance through unpleasant tasks.

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of her career (1973-1975), using play, therapeutic discussions and parent guidance as her means of intervention, Yahav worked with children, adolescents and their parents. For 15 years, beginning in 1975, she worked at the Technion’s Psychological Services where she specialized in psychotherapy for young adults with a variety of difficulties: students suffering from exam anxiety, shyness, depression, personality disorders, eating disorders, interpersonal problems, identity issues, separation difficulties, marital problems, and more. Her therapeutic work is based on classic and contemporary psychodynamic theory, psychosocial approaches, cognitive-behavioural approaches and a number of family therapy approaches. In 1978-1979, Yahav worked with patients of Rambam Hospital’s Psychiatric Clinic who were living in the community, conducting family interventions as well. In the 1980s, Yahav opened a private clinic that she maintains to the present day. She generally sees long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy clients and she supervises other clinicians. Toward the mid-1980s, the emphasis in her work and her therapy moved to theories she saw as more complex and she deepened her studies and therapy, studying Jungian psychotherapy and afterward classic and contemporary psychodynamic approaches: Freud’s Drive Theory, Anna Freud’s Ego-Psychology Theory, Object Relations Theory of Fairburn, Melanie Klein and Winnicott, and self-psychology and inter-subjective psychology. Yahav applies these approaches when conducting psychotherapy with adults, in parental guidance. This clinical work provides a fertile base <b>upon</b> which to <b>do</b> <b>research.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{photograph}} {{is a historical}} document: it is a record of a time past. Like other historical documents it requires establishing its provenance to express its total value. One of the important ingredients of provenance is information concerning {{the author of the}} photograph—the photographer. This human element in the activity of taking a picture is the person who for some reason chose to record a particular event, person, scene, or streetscape, and to do so with a style and purpose that must be considered unique. A {{photograph is}} a human product {{in the same way that}} a written note expresses its author’s hand and mind. This paper, based <b>upon</b> <b>research</b> <b>done</b> nearly 30 years ago, is a preliminary attempt to provide for the student of historic photographs information for knowing the photographer behind the photograph. It is a survey of photographers and artists in Kansas City, Missouri, from ca. 1850 to ca. 1882 : a compilation of names, occupations, addresses, and relationships of persons involved in what can be called the beginnings of the photographic and arts community in Kansas City.

40|$|Building <b>upon</b> {{previous}} <b>research</b> <b>done</b> on interactivity attributes {{describing the}} aesthetic quality of interactions, this paper aims {{to explore the}} sense of ow in screen-based interactions, narrowing down to the finer details that make {{the personality of the}} interactive experience. The goal is to provide a deeper knowledge on the concrete, expressive qualities of screen based interaction, being “the immaterial material” moulded in the design process. The relevant information for practicing designers is the awareness of what emotions certain interactions elicit and how interactions can be used to convey brand personality. The process conducted followed a research through design methodology, as the aim was to explore the defined design space rather than answer a specific problem. Two major user studies provided insights and refocus in the process along the way to the final result: a set of guidelines and a prototype embodying them. The guidelines provide some details on designing flow experiences on a mobile screen, and are to serve as inspiration and reference to future work and design practice. The prototype, called ‘The Embodiment’ serves as an illustration of the guidelines, as mere words are not able to fully describe the dynamic quality...|$|R
40|$|This project shadows {{the work}} of student groups in Math 110, a {{qualitative}} literacy class, engaged in exploratory learning exercises. An instructor monitors these groups by both walking {{around the room and}} observing group conversation at another computer. Our goal is to put this exercise online, and as a result leave the entire monitoring process up to the computer, assuming the role that the instructor traditionally assumes. Using labeling techniques to decipher meaning in dialogue of students working in groups for Math 110, we try to see how students collaborate to solve problems together. Bits of realization, conversation, and problem-solving tags are sorted out and gathered to identify the main points that are expressed during the problem solving of the two person game, Poison. Expanding <b>upon</b> previous <b>research</b> <b>done</b> by other students, we are able to add to bits of realization that students encounter in their work. One purpose is to explore the differences between voice-recorded dialogue and computer-mediated chat dialogue. By examining these transcripts, researchers can raise questions about what sort of content is discussed to solve a problem and prepare the computer to recognize bits or realization in students 2 ̆ 7 work...|$|R
