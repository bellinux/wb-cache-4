5|$|Northeast Minnesota has 2700-million-year-ago exposed rocks formed during {{volcanic}} activity {{that was in}} the form of seepage of lava from rifts in the sea floor. These lava flows began to rise <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient ocean to form the Superior craton; the Superior craton later assembled into the Canadian shield, which became part of the North American craton. The Superior province is the largest preserved fragment of Archean crust, and the Canadian shield is the nucleus of the North American craton.|$|E
5|$|About 20 North Korean {{soldiers}} approached, undiscovered, {{close enough}} to the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry, command post west of Haman to throw grenades and fire into it. About 45 soldiers of the battalion command group and 20 South Korean recruits were in position there at the time. The North Koreans were driven off at dawn, but Major Eugene J. Carson, battalion executive officer, then discovered that he had on the position with him only 30 men, 7 of them wounded. Looking back down the hill, Carson saw approximately 40 men get <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rice paddies and go over to a tank at a roadblock position. These men reported to the regiment that they had been driven off the hill. Three tanks near the command post helped clear the town of North Koreans.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{was born}} in Silsbee, Texas. As a child, {{he was a big}} wrestling fan and André the Giant was his {{favorite}} wrestler. While attending a wrestling show in Beaumont, Texas, young Henry tried to touch André as he was walking down the aisle, but tripped over the barricade. André picked him <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crowd and put him back behind the barricade. When Henry was 12 years old, his father, Ernest, died of complications from diabetes. When he was 14 years old, Henry was diagnosed with dyslexia.|$|E
5|$|Masters, as Zissos points out, {{argues that}} the Sibyl's {{commands}} to bury Misenus and find the Golden Bough are inverted and compacted in Lucan: Erichtho needs a bodynot buriedbut rather retrieved. Many other parallels and inversions abound, including: the difference of opinions about the ease of getting what is sought from the underworld (the Sibyl says only the initial descent to the underworld will be easy, whereas Erichtho says necromancy is simple), the opposing manner in which those seeking information from the underworld are described (the Sibyl urges Aeneas to be courageous, whereas Erichtho criticizes Sextus Pompeius for being cowardly), and the inverted {{manner in which the}} supernatural rites proceed (the Sibyl sends Aeneas underground to gain knowledge, whereas Erichtho conjures a spirit <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground to learn the future).|$|E
5|$|Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) later {{reports to}} Reyes and Scully that Comer has died. Reyes accuses Toothpick Man {{and others in}} the room of killing Comer. Meanwhile, Scully visits Doggett, who warns her not to trust the cultists. However, Scully goes to meet Josepho near Calgary. Josepho claims to be {{protecting}} William, but demands Mulder's head as collateral in exchange for the baby's release. When Josepho returns to the wreck site, the Overcoat Woman relates that the aperture of the craft began to glow when William started crying. The craft soon rises <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground. Looking on the site from a distance, Scully and Reyes see the craft burst out of an enclosure and into space, lighting the ground beneath it on fire as it goes. The two find an unharmed William among the charred bodies of the cultists.|$|E

25|$|Caves {{can carry}} strong water {{currents}}. Most caves emerge {{on the surface}} as either springs or siphons. Springs have out flowing currents, where water is coming <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth and flowing out across the land's surface. Siphons have in-flowing currents where, for example, an above-ground river is going underground. Some caves are complex and have some tunnels with out-flowing currents, and other tunnels with in-flowing currents. If currents are not properly managed, they can cause serious problems for the diver.|$|E
25|$|Ten years later, Zhao was {{detailed}} {{to restore}} the city. With the aid of his brother, Zhao Yingdou, he induced the Jews to recross the river and take up their old quarters. The temple was rebuilt in 1653, with the personal financial support of Zhao, who had grown rich from land speculation and prostitution. One complete scroll of the Law was made <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fragments which had been saved from the river, and other copies were made from this. A stone stele dated 1663 was afterward erected, giving the details of Zhao Yingcheng's action.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{building blocks}} of experience, i.e. objective knowledge, are now in place. First there is the sensibility, which supplies the mind with intuitions, {{and then there is}} the understanding, which produces judgments of these intuitions and can subsume them under categories. These categories lift the intuitions <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subject's current state of consciousness and place them within consciousness in general, producing universally necessary knowledge. For the categories are innate in any rational being, so any intuition thought within a category in one mind is necessarily subsumed and understood identically in any mind. In other words, we filter what we see and hear.|$|E

And again, so soon as I had been baptized by him, I also had the spirit of prophecy, when, standing up, I prophesied concerning the rise of this Church, and many other things connected with the Church, and this generation of the children of men.

25|$|At Warwick, {{the canal}} rises by two locks to Budbrooke Junction (formerly the {{junction}} with the then-independent Warwick and Birmingham Canal). To {{the left is}} the restored Saltisford Canal Arm, a short stretch that used to run under the railway to the original canal basin complex and terminus of the Warwick and Birmingham Canal – the basin was filled-in in the 1970s. The canal used to serve the oldest gas works {{in the world and}} several unusual hexagonal buildings remain opposite Sainsbury's. After half a mile the mainline reaches the bottom of the Hatton flight of 21 locks that lift the canal <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Avon Valley. The first 10 locks are spaced out but from the middle lock the flight is tightly spaced.|$|E
25|$|While {{wandering}} around New Orleans before a show with Dockstader's Minstrels, he enters a small club {{where a group}} of black jazz musicians are performing. Jolson has a revelation, that the staid repertoire of the minstrel troupe can be transformed by actually playing black music in blackface. He tells Dockstader that he wants to sing what he has just experienced: 'I heard some music tonight, something they call jazz. Some fellows just make it up as they go along. They pick it <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air.' After Dockstader refuses to accommodate Jolson's revolutionary concept, the narrative chronicles his climb to stardom as he allegedly injects jazz into his blackface performances … Jolson's success is built on anticipating what Americans really want. Dockstader performs the inevitable function of the guardian of the status quo, whose hidebound commitment to what is about to become obsolete reinforces the audience's sympathy with the forward-looking hero.|$|E

25|$|Métis {{were among}} the first groups of fur traders who came from the Northeast. These men were mostly of a mixed race identity, largely Iroquois, as well as other tribes from the Ohio country. Rather than one tribal identity, many of these Métis had {{multiple}} Indian heritages. Lewis and Clark, who opened up the market on the fur trade in the Upper Missouri, brought with them many Métis to serve as engagés. These same Métis would become involved in the early western fur trade. Many of them settled on the Missouri River and married into the tribes there before setting up their trade networks. The first generation of Métis born in the West grew <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old fur trade and provided a bridge to the new western empire. These Métis possessed both native and European skills, spoke multiple languages, and had the important kinship networks required for trade. In addition, many spoke the Michif Métis dialect. In an effort to distinguish themselves from natives, many Métis strongly associated with Roman Catholic beliefs and avoided participating in native ceremonies.|$|E
25|$|While {{the backs}} prepare {{to receive a}} kick, the other {{defenders}} will attempt to apply pressure to the kicker. It is usually rather predictable when a side is about to kick: normally {{one member of the}} attacking team is in charge of kicking, and as the team prepares to kick, he will drop back and make himself available deep behind the dummy half, to give himself space and time to set up for the kick. To limit the kicker's effectiveness, the defenders will often rush <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defensive line towards him. As well as giving him less time to set up, this action can cloud the kicker's mind, distracting him with thoughts of the upcoming tackle or encouraging him to consider switching to another attacking option due to the sudden change in the defensive line. This combination of physical and mental pressure may lead to a poor kick, giving an advantage to the non-kicking team. This manoeuvre could also result in a 'charge-down', if a defending player manages {{to get in the way}} of the ball very shortly after it is kicked (If the ball travels forward this is an exception to the knock-on rule). This often results in a line break or try to the previously defending team, however it runs the risk of having the attacking team regather the ball for a new set of tackles.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the notable}} {{features}} of Baghdad {{during this period}} were its exceptional libraries. Many of the Abbasid caliphs were patrons of learning and enjoyed collecting both ancient and contemporary literature. Although some of the princes of the previous Umayyad dynasty had begun to gather and translate Greek scientific literature, the Abbasids {{were the first to}} foster Greek learning on a large scale. Many of these libraries were private collections intended only {{for the use of the}} owners and their immediate friends, but the libraries of the caliphs and other officials soon took on a public or a semi-public character. Four great libraries were established in Baghdad during this period. The earliest was that of the famous Al Mamun, who was caliph from 813 to 833. Another was established by Sabur Ibn Ardashir in 991 or 993 for the literary men and scholars who frequented his academy. Unfortunately, this second library was plundered and burned by the Seljuks only seventy years after it was established. This was a good example of the sort of library built <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> needs and interests of a literary society. The last two were examples of madrasa or theological college libraries. The Nizamiyah was founded by the Persian Nizam al Mulk, who was vizier of two early Seljuk sultans. It continued to operate even after the coming of the Mongols in 1258. The Mustansiriyah madrasa, which owned an exceedingly rich library, was founded by Al Mustansir, the second last Abbasid caliph, who died in 1242. This would prove to be the last great library built by the caliphs of Baghdad.|$|E

25|$|When he was 11 years old, Plenty Coups had {{a second}} vision {{involving}} the Little People, one that changed the fate of his entire tribe. Plenty Coups' family had moved to be with other bands of Crow lodging in the Beartooth Mountains. All the young men were challenged {{to go into the}} hills to seek visions, and Plenty Coups did so. Plenty Coups walked for two days (fasting as he went) and entered the Crazy Mountains, but had no vision. He returned a few days later with three friends, fasted, and took sweat-baths. He decided to cut off the tip of his left index finger as an offering to the spirits. That night, he dreamt of the chief of the Little People again. The chief introduced Plenty Coups to a buffalo that turned into a man with buffalo-like features (the buffalo-man), who led him underground and down a tunnel or path toward the Pryor Mountains. For two days, he traveled underground among throngs of American bison. Finally, the buffalo-man showed Plenty Coups a vision of endless streams of bison coming out of {{a hole in the ground}} but disappearing. Then a second stream of bison—with different colors (even spots), tails, and sounds—came <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground, and remained on the plains. Plenty Coups had a vision of himself as an old man lodged near the Medicine Rocks, and of a vast forest whose trees had been felled by a great wind. Only a chickadee remained. A voice told Plenty Coups that the day of the Plains Indian was ending, and that white men would swarm over the land like buffalo. But the chickadee remains, because it is a good listener, develops its mind, and survives by its wits.|$|E
