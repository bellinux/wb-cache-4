5|$|The San Diego {{chapter of}} JC's Girls {{is based at}} the Rock Church, a 10,000-member church with a {{majority}} of members {{under the age of}} 30. In the first year, several strippers left the sex industry and began volunteering with the chapter. Many of the chapter's members do not personally visit strip clubs but help in other ways. Scher said the former strippers were the most effective JC's Girls volunteers because they <b>understand</b> <b>from</b> personal experience the situations of the women they are trying to help. By 2011, members of the San Diego chapter of JC's Girls were visiting strip clubs twice each month. They pray before, during, and after each visit and a team of other members pray for them from another location.|$|E

25|$|It {{should be}} {{mentioned}} that this depiction of intellectual tradition in Islamic Lands is mainly dependent upon what West could understand (or {{was willing to}} <b>understand)</b> <b>from</b> this long era. In contrast, there are some historians and philosophers who {{do not agree with}} this account and describe this era in a completely different way. Their main point of dispute is on the influence of different philosophers on Islamic Philosophy, especially the comparative importance of eastern intellectuals such as Ibn Sina and of western thinkers such as Ibn Rushd.|$|E

Christopher further claims he can reverse Wikus' mutation in the mothership. To recover the canister from MNU headquarters, Wikus obtains alien weapons from superstitious District 9 Nigerian arms dealer Obesandjo (Eugene Khumbanyiwa) and his gang, which he and Christopher use to assault the headquarters, retrieve the canister, and flee to District 9 with MNU forces in pursuit.|$|E
25|$|Boltzmann {{accomplished}} the feat of {{showing that the}} second law of thermodynamics is only a statistical fact. The gradual disordering of energy {{is analogous to the}} disordering of an initially ordered pack of cards under repeated shuffling, and just as the cards will finally return to their original order if shuffled a gigantic number of times, so the entire universe must some-day regain, by pure chance, the state from which it first set out. (This optimistic coda to the idea of the dying universe becomes somewhat muted when one attempts to estimate the timeline which will probably elapse before it spontaneously occurs.) The tendency for entropy increase seems to cause difficulty to beginners in thermodynamics, but is easy to <b>understand</b> <b>from</b> the standpoint of the theory of probability. Consider two ordinary dice, with both sixes face up. After the dice are shaken, the chance of finding these two sixes face up is small (1 in 36); thus one can say that the random motion (the agitation) of the dice, like the chaotic collisions of molecules because of thermal energy, causes the less probable state to change to one that is more probable. With millions of dice, like the millions of atoms involved in thermodynamic calculations, the probability of their all being sixes becomes so vanishingly small that the system must move to one of the more probable states. However, mathematically the odds of all the dice results not being a pair sixes is also as hard as the ones of all of them being sixes, and since statistically the data tend to balance, one in every 36 pairs of dice will tend to be a pair of sixes, and the cards -when shuffled- will sometimes present a certain temporary sequence order even if in its whole the deck was disordered.|$|E

500|$|He {{stressed}} that the financial administration's transparency differs enormously between countries; especially the non-transparent monarchies may be much more expensive than is publicly known. This means comparing them to republics, especially the very transparent administration of France where citizens can {{know exactly what they}} pay for, may be unfair. In a 2015 interview with NRC Handelsblad, Matthijs commented that the then-known €7.7 million allotted to the royal house in Spain's national budget was 'unbelievable': [...] "I can't find out more, but I <b>understand</b> <b>from</b> the media that the total expenses of the Spanish house may be as much as 80 million." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 1994, the {{eviction}} of Claremont Road took place, bringing {{an end to}} the M11 {{link road}} resistance as a major physical protest. Bailiffs, accompanied by the police in full riot gear, carried out the eviction over several days, and the Central line, running adjacent to the road, was suspended. As soon as eviction was completed, the remaining properties were demolished. In the end, the cost to the taxpayer was over a million pounds in police costs alone. Quoting David Maclean, [...] "I <b>understand</b> <b>from</b> the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis that the cost of policing the protest in order to allow bailiffs to take possession of the premises in Claremont road was £1,014,060." [...] Cohen complained in parliament about police brutality, stating [...] "were not many of my constituents bullied—including vulnerable people, and others whose only crime was living on the line of route?" [...] The then Secretary of State for Transport, Brian Mawhinney, pointed out that there had already been three public enquiries at which protesters could have lodged their objections against the line of the route.|$|E

Lyrically, [...] "I Did It, Mama!" [...] is about the [...] "conflict between different generations, more specific between children and their parents". Throughout the lyrics, Stan urges her parents to accept her misunderstood new boyfriend. However, with the refrain of the song, she stands her ground, repeating the track's title several times. Bradely Stern, writing for music website Pop Crush, compared {{the message of the}} song to that of Madonna's [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] (1986), while Stan herself confessed that [...] " [...] is a more rebellious recording that parents may not <b>understand</b> <b>from</b> the first play". She has, as well, named the tune a mixture between europop, reggaeton and Balkanic music. Hitfire described [...] "I Did, It Mama!" [...] as a [...] "successful" [...] dance-pop track, and Gay Times named it an [...] "eurodance banger".

2500|$|Moore is {{credited}} {{by his friend}} Charles Fenno Hoffman as author in the 25 December 1837 Pennsylvania Inquirer and Daily Courier. Further, the Rev. David Butler, who allegedly showed the poem to Sentinel editor Orville L. Holley, was a relative of Moore's. A letter to Moore from the publisher states, [...] "I <b>understand</b> <b>from</b> Mr. Holley that he received it from Mrs. Sackett, the wife of Mr. Daniel Sackett who was then a merchant in this city". Moore preferred to be known for his more scholarly works, but allowed the poem {{to be included in}} his anthology in 1844 at the request of his children. By that time, the original publisher and at least seven others had already acknowledged his authorship. Livingston family lore gives credit to their forebear rather than Moore, but there is no proof that Livingston himself ever claimed authorship, nor has any record ever been found of any printing of the poem with Livingston's name attached to it, despite more than 40 years of searches.|$|E
2500|$|This {{inherently}} non-conformist {{culture has}} tended to set Birmingham apart from the London-dominated English cultural mainstream. The Independent wrote in 2012 of Birmingham's [...] "intangible sense of the other, of being different despite being the bullseye of Britain". The poet Roy Fisher called it an [...] "off-shore island {{in the middle of}} England". Writing in 1945, while the poet W. H. Auden was arguably the dominant figure of English literature worldwide, [...] the American critic Edmund Wilson could still note how his [...] "Birmingham background" [...] meant that [...] "in fundamental ways ... he doesn't belong in that London literary world – he's more vigorous and more advanced". However the same characteristic that sets Birmingham apart can also make it difficult to characterise and <b>understand</b> <b>from</b> outside. Disjunction and incongruity {{lie at the heart of}} the city's identity, and Birmingham often lacks the superficial unifying aesthetic of more homogenous cities. Writers, artists or musicians cooperating in socially close-knit groups but producing work with little stylistic unity have been a characteristic of Birmingham's culture from the Lunar Society of the 1750s, through the Birmingham Group of the 1890s and the Highfield writers of the 1930s ...|$|E

2500|$|Todd Akin, {{a long-time}} anti-abortion activist, {{served as a}} Republican member of the House of Representatives for Missouri's 2nd congressional {{district}} from 2001 until 2013. On August 7, 2012, Akin won the Republican primary to become his party's nominee for the U.S. Senate election in Missouri. On August 19, Akin said that victims of what he termed [...] "legitimate rape" [...] rarely become pregnant. He said this during an interview aired on the St. Louis television station KTVI-TV when asked whether women who are raped and become pregnant should {{have the option of}} abortion. He replied:Well you know, people always want to try to make that as one of those things, well how do you, how do you slice this particularly tough sort of ethical question. First of all, from what I <b>understand</b> <b>from</b> doctors, that's really rare. If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. But let's assume that maybe that didn't work or something. I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist and not attacking the child.|$|E
2500|$|In the US, several {{politicians}} in the Republican Party have advanced claims that pregnancy from rape is rare. Pennsylvania state representative Stephen Freind claimed in 1988 that {{the odds of a}} pregnancy resulting from rape were [...] "one in millions and millions and millions". James Leon Holmes published a letter in 1980 stating, [...] "concern for rape victims is a red herring because conceptions from rape occur with approximately the same frequency as snowfall in Miami". Holmes apologized for this remark in 2003 after he was nominated as a United States federal judge. (He was confirmed in 2004). In 1995, North Carolina House of Representatives member Henry Aldridge remarked during a debate to eliminate a state abortion fund for poor women: [...] "The facts show that people who are raped– who are truly raped– the juices don't flow, the body functions don't work and they don't get pregnant. Medical authorities agree that this is a rarity, if ever." [...] In 1998, Arkansas state senator Fay Boozman lost a campaign for a US Senate seat after remarking that fear-induced hormonal changes made rape victims unlikely to become pregnant. He later apologized and eventually called the claim a mistake, but the controversy was renewed in 1999 when he was appointed director of the Arkansas Department of Health by then-governor Mike Huckabee. During his campaign in the United States Senate election in Missouri, 2012, US Representative Todd Akin commented on abortion exceptions for rape victims: [...] "I <b>understand</b> <b>from</b> doctors, that's really rare. If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down." [...] The comment was widely criticized, and Akin apologized, saying he [...] "misspoke". Akin's suggestion that rape is unlikely to result in pregnancy was defended by some prominent individuals and groups which oppose legal abortion. A SurveyUSA poll one day after Akin's comments reported that 76% of Missouri adults disagreed with Akin, 13% [...] agreed with the statement and 11% were unsure (±3.8%).|$|E
