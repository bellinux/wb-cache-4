40|$|In this study, {{we explore}} the {{applicability}} of a service profit chain concept for the authorized <b>car</b> <b>servicing</b> network of five European car brands in Slovenia. Under this concept, increased quality positively influences customer satisfaction, which in turn leads to better financial results through increased customer loyalty. We demonstrated that there are significant differences among the three size classes of <b>car</b> <b>servicing</b> companies. At the same average level of customer satisfaction, {{there is a strong}} negative dependence between increases of customer satisfaction and financial results for the small-sized <b>car</b> <b>servicing</b> companies, and a positive dependence between those two for the medium-sized and large-sized <b>car</b> <b>servicing</b> companies, which is moderate for the former and very strong for the latter. It seems that the relationship between the overall customer satisfaction and financial results is largely dependent on the level of competition in the local environment. Bigger <b>car</b> <b>servicing</b> companies are usually located in cities, where there are often other authorised same brand <b>car</b> <b>servicing</b> companies. Hence, it is not that difficult for customers to switch to a different <b>car</b> <b>servicing</b> company if they become dissatisfied with the services. In those circumstances it makes sense to invest more into high customer satisfaction, because it leads to high customer loyalty. Loyal customers are namely less likely to change a <b>car</b> <b>servicing</b> company and are less susceptible to higher hourly rates. The results also suggest that a certain optimal level of customer satisfaction exists and whe n this level of satisfaction is surpassed, the financial results actually do not improve any more. Moreover, they usually deteriorate...|$|R
