500|$|The ancient Svetambara Jain text Acharanga Sutra, {{dated to}} about 3rd or 2nd century BCE, {{describes}} three forms of Sallekhana: the Bhaktapratyakhyana, the Ingita-marana, and the Padapopagamana. In Bhaktapratyakhyana, {{the person who}} wants to observe the vow selects an isolated place where he lies on a bed made of straw, does not move his limbs, and avoids food and drink <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>dies.</b> In Ingita-marana, the person sleeps on bare ground. He can sit, stand, walk, or move, but avoids food <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>dies.</b> In Padapopagamana, a person stands [...] "like a tree" [...] without food and drink <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>dies.</b>|$|R

5|$|Although {{little is}} known about the exact nature of Tréhot's {{relationship}} with Renoir while she was modeling; she is said to have given birth to a baby boy named Pierre on 14 December 1868, but it is unclear what became of him and he may have died as an infant. On 21 July 1870, Tréhot gave birth to a baby girl named Jeanne (d. 1934) who was given to a wet nurse to raise as her own. Renoir continued to secretly support Jeanne financially <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>died</b> (and after his death with the help of Ambroise Vollard), but never publicly or legally acknowledged that she was his daughter during his lifetime.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, {{in the second half of}} the 16th century, Poland–Lithuania became an {{elective}} monarchy, in which the king was elected by the hereditary nobility. This king would serve as the monarch <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>died,</b> at which time the country would have another election. This monarchy has been commonly referred to as a rzeczpospolita or republic, because of the high degree of influence wielded by the noble classes, often seen as a single non-homogenous class.|$|E
5|$|Betances' {{last days}} were chaotic, {{not only because}} of the events in the Caribbean, but also because of what {{happening}} in his own household. Jiménez' mental state is reported as dubious by then. Some even suggest that she had become an alcoholic (probably) or even a morphine addict (unlikely) by then, and she even wished for her husband to die in tantrums reported by his doctors. Political foes attempted to gain possession of Betances' intelligence dossiers, as did Spanish intelligence agents in Paris. Betances asked personal friends to keep personal guard of him, which they did <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>died.</b>|$|E

5|$|By his own {{description}} of his early family life, Cody grew up poor. His mother worked two jobs, as a traveling nurse and a bus driver, to care {{for him and his}} seven younger siblings. His parents were not married, but his father, a construction worker, {{was a big part of}} his life <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>died</b> in a car accident when Cody was 11. At the end of his junior year of high school, Cody moved in with the family of a high school teammate.|$|E
5|$|He {{took over}} {{management}} of the family estates upon his brother Frank's retirement to England in November 1908, {{and two years later}} became {{a founding member of the}} Brisbane branch of the Round Table. Between 1914 and 1917, he was a member of the Queensland Recruiting Committee but left in protest over the failure of the 1916 Federal Government referendum to introduce conscription. Instead, he joined the Queensland Reinforcements Referendum Committee, of which he became president. He remained active as a pastoralist and businessman until his retirement in 1920, at which time he moved to England. In 1921, he moved to Howletts, his parents' former home in Bekesbourne, Kent, and remained there <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>died</b> on 25 June 1957.|$|E
5|$|In 1901 Newman {{became the}} lessee {{of the hall}} {{as well as its}} manager, but the {{following}} year, after unwise investment in theatrical presentations, he was declared bankrupt. The music publisher Chappell and Co took over the lease of the building, retaining Newman as manager. The Queen's Hall orchestra and concerts were rescued by the musical benefactor Sir Edgar Speyer, a banker of German origin. Speyer put up the necessary funds, encouraged Newman and Wood to continue with their project of musical education, and underwrote the Proms and the main Symphony Concert seasons. Newman remained manager of the hall until 1906 and manager of the concerts <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>died</b> in 1926.|$|E

5|$|On December 17, Judge Sanderson finally {{ruled that}} prize {{fighting}} was illegal in San Francisco {{and the courts}} would not determine who the winner was. Sharkey retained the purse, but the decision provided no vindication for Earp. Until the fight, Earp had been a minor figure known regionally in California and Arizona. Afterward, his name was known {{from coast to coast}} in the worst possible way. Earp sold his interest in his horses on December 20 and left San Francisco shortly afterward. He only returned when he caught a boat to Alaska. Earp's decision left a smear on his public character that followed him <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>died</b> and afterward.|$|E
5|$|Postmaster General James Farley {{occupied}} two adjoining suites in {{the current}} Waldorf Astoria during his tenure {{as the chairman of}} the board of Coca-Cola's International division from 1940 until his death in 1976, arguably one of the landmark's longest housed tenants. The Presidential Suite at the hotel come from when, during the 1950s and early 1960s, former U.S. president Herbert Hoover and retired U.S. General Douglas MacArthur lived in suites on different floors of the hotel. Hoover lived at the Waldorf Astoria for over 30 years from after the end of his presidency <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>died</b> in 1964; former President Dwight D. Eisenhower lived there <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>died</b> in 1969. MacArthur's widow, Jean MacArthur, lived there from 1952 until her death in 2000. A plaque affixed to the wall on the 50th Street side commemorates this. John F. Kennedy was fond of the Waldorf Astoria and had a number of private meetings at the hotel, including one with Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion. Since Hoover, every President of the United States has either stayed over or lived in the Waldorf Astoria, although Jimmy Carter claimed to have never stayed overnight at the hotel. Nancy Reagan was reputedly not fond of the Presidential Suite.|$|E
5|$|Senators raised {{concerns}} that the Congress could either abuse such authority or neglect to enact any such legislation after the adoption of this proposal.

5|$|Upon {{leaving the}} White House, the couple {{returned}} to California, where they purchased {{a home in}} the wealthy East Gate Old Bel Air neighborhood of Bel Air, Los Angeles, dividing their time between Bel Air and the Reagan Ranch in Santa Barbara, California. Ronald and Nancy regularly attended the Bel Air Church as well. After leaving Washington, Reagan made numerous public appearances, many on behalf of her husband.

5|$|Wyatt and Virgil Earp and Doc Holliday {{believed}} that Tom had a revolver {{at the time}} of the gunfight. Wyatt thought Tom fired a revolver under the horse's neck and believed <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>died</b> that Tom's revolver had been removed from the scene by Wesley Fuller. Witness Fallehy wrote that he saw Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday shooting at a man who was using a horse to barricade himself, and once shot the man fell. In his statement, Fallehy wrote that the man still held his pistol in his hand. Although he did not see him shoot, he thought Tom McLaury was armed.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev had {{struggled}} with several ailments since 1974, most notably heart disease, leukemia, jaw cancer, emphysema and circulatory disease, {{all of which}} had been exacerbated by his heavy smoking and obesity. There had been rumours of Brezhnev's death ever since the mid-1970s; he had been absent from important meetings demanded by protocol and it was rumoured that his health was in decline. Brezhnev had rarely appeared in public for most of 1982 and was usually surrounded by doctors, although the Soviet Government insisted that he was not ill. He suffered a severe stroke in May 1982, but refused to relinquish office <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>died</b> on 10 November 1982 after suffering a heart attack. He was honoured with a state funeral in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis on the Red Square after a five-day period of nationwide mourning.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{allegedly}} remarried, {{this time}} to Angeline Johnson, in the early 1930s, but, as with Harris, {{it is unlikely that}} the union was officially registered. Throughout the Great Depression and the 1940s, he performed in several cities and towns in Texas, including Beaumont. A city directory shows that in 1945, a Reverend W. J. Johnson—undoubtedly Blind Willie—operated the House of Prayer at 1440 Forrest Street, in Beaumont. In 1945, his home was destroyed by a fire, but, with nowhere else to go, Johnson continued to live in the ruins of his house, where he was exposed to the humidity. He contracted malarial fever, and no hospital would admit him, either because of his visual impairment, as Angeline Johnson stated in an interview with Charters, or because he was black. Over the course of the year, his condition steadily worsened <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>died,</b> on September 18, 1945. His death certificate reported syphilis and blindness as contributing factors.|$|E
5|$|Leofric survived William the Conqueror's 1068 {{siege of}} Exeter unscathed, {{although}} {{there is no evidence that}} he was present in the city during the siege. Whether Leofric had originally supported King Harold against William or if he supported William from the start is unclear. The fact that he survived William's purge of the native English bishops in 1070 is evidence that he must not have been too outspoken against William. Leofric remained bishop <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>died</b> on 10 February or 11 February 1072. He was buried in the crypt of his cathedral. When the cathedral was rebuilt, his remains were moved to the new church, but the location of the tomb has been lost. The current tomb only dates from 1568 and does not mark Leofric's resting place.|$|E
5|$|On December 5, 1989, Judge Roth found Taylor {{guilty of}} the first-degree child rape and first-degree murder of Charla Nicole King. During the penalty phase of Taylor's trial, his {{half-sister}} Leslie Beale traveled from Florida to testify about his harsh treatment under his stepfather and the three years that Taylor spent in a sex offender program at a Florida mental institution. On December 19, Taylor became the first convict in 40 years {{to be sent to}} death row by a Weber County court. Roth said that {{the facts of the case}} outweighed any mitigating circumstances. Taylor's father Albert attended most of his son's court proceedings <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>died</b> of heart failure on October 8, 1990. Taylor said he was not permitted to attend his father's funeral.|$|E
