40|$|Undersowing a {{main crop}} enables {{establishment}} of a catch crop in areas characterized by a short post-harvest period {{before the onset of}} winter. Techniques with lower costs than conventional undersowing by separate drilling are often regarded as unreliable. Undersowing by drilling after sowing spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was compared with broadcast sowing simultaneously with drilling barley. Various implements were coupled behind the combined drill in cases where seed was broadcast: a press-wheel attachment, a long-tined harrow and a cage roller. A fourth treatment did not include an implement coupled behind the drill. The <b>undersown</b> <b>crop</b> was sown as a seed mixture of 3 kg ha- 1 red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and 6 kg ha- 1 meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Hudson). The numbers of plants and weeds and the plant height were measured five times during the growing season. Above-ground biomass of the undersown species was determined at barley harvest and in late autumn. Grain yield of spring barley was recorded. Drilling resulted in the highest yield of <b>undersown</b> <b>crop</b> when an early summer drought occurred, but broadcasting in combination with use of seed covering equipment led to the least variation in biomass production over the 4 years the experiment was conducted. The relative proportion of meadow fescue in the crop was low in three years, and lower when broadcast than when drilled. Barley grain yield was highest when the seed was broadcast and seed covering equipment was used. Use of a cage roller creased weed biomass, but press-wheels and a long-tined harrow did not. Separate rolling after undersowing increased <b>undersown</b> <b>crop</b> yield in one year, but decreased grain yield in some cases. vokKV...|$|E

40|$|The {{disadvantages}} {{associated with}} invariable cereal cropping, concern about nutrient leaching {{and the price}} of nitrogen (N) fertilizer have increasingly become the subjects of discussion during recent decades. An <b>undersown</b> <b>crop,</b> which grows together with a main crop and post-harvest, could address such disadvantages. The aim {{of this study was to}} gain knowledge needed to develop undersowing for Finnish conditions in the interests of optimizing cereal production and meeting environmental goals. Studies were made on the effects of undersown species and management practices on biomass and N yield of undersown crops, grain yield of spring cereals and soil nitrate levels. In total, 17 plant species were undersown in spring cereals during the field experiments carried out between 1991 and 1999 at four sites in south and central Finland. After analysis of preliminary results, eight species were studied more thoroughly. Two legumes, one grass species and one grass-legume mixture were included in long-term trials in order to study annually repeated undersowing. Simultaneous broadcasting of seeds instead of specific undersowing was also studied. Moreover, seeding rates of undersown crops and N fertilization application rates during annually repeated undersowing were researched. Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam., IR) absorbed soil nitrate N (NO 3 -N) most efficiently in autumn and timothy (Phleum pratense L.) in spring. The capacity of other grass species to take-up N was low, or it was insufficient considering its negative effect on grain yield. Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) were well suited to annually repeated undersowing, supplying fixed N for cereals without markedly increasing the risk of N leaching. Autumn oriented growth rhythms of the studied legumes were optimal for undersowing, whereas those of grasses were less well suited despite variation in the trait among species. All species were compared according several critical features required of an undersowing system. A model of an adaptive undersowing system was outlined in order to emphasize allocation of measures according to needs. After defining the goal of undersowing, many decisions need to be made. When the primary consideration is reduction in N leaching, a mixture of IR and timothy is advantageous. Clovers represent suitable replacements for N fertilization because their positive residual effect is greater than the negative effect of increased competition. A mixture of legume and nonlegume is a good choice when increased plant diversity is the main target. Seeding rate is an efficient means for adjusting the levels of competition and N effects. Broadcasting with soil covering equipment can be used to establish an <b>undersown</b> <b>crop.</b> In addition, timing and method of cover crop termination play an important role in the outcome.

The working hypothesis was that the <b>undersown</b> <b>crops</b> and animal manure would stimulate the microarthropods and other food sources, thereby enhancing the abundance of natural enemies. The ANOVA analyses revealed no impact of manuring and <b>undersown</b> catch <b>crops</b> on the microarthropods, but there was a larger abundance of most predator groups in the manured plots. There was not found any impact of <b>undersown</b> <b>crops</b> on the arthropod fauna elements. In stead analyses with the statistical package PRIMER revealed correlations between certain species of the Collembola community and the natural enemies (carabids and spiders), correlations which due to knowledge on food quality relationships are likely to be cause – effect relationships. The results suggest that when attempting to boost abundance of natural enemies in agricultural fields the working hypotheses needs a higher level of detail.

Tillage was performed in mid- October or in May, before sowing of the barley and ryegrass for the next season. In the second, {{third and fourth years}} of the experiment, total N leaching from barley without undersown ryegrass was 15, 7. 9, 32 and 38 kg ha- 1 y- 1 in clay, silt, sand and peat soil, respectively. Undersowing reduced N leaching by 52, 31, 68 and 27 %. The reduction in N leaching from clay and sand when barley was undersown with ryegrass was nearly the same as the increased total uptake of N (barley +ryegrass). In sand soil, ryegrass was able to diminish the NO 3 -N concentration of the drainage water well below the limit for acceptable drinking water.

40|$|Leaching of {{nitrogen}} (N) and phosphorus (P) for different 6 -year organic crop rotations was examined in separately tile-drained field plots {{on two different}} sites in southwest Sweden. On each site, two different farming systems, one with dairy cows and one without stock, were evaluated to identify parts of the crop rotations with the greatest risks of N and P leaching and to examine the scope for improvement. Although organic farming methods themselves already led {{to a reduction in}} nutrient leaching, critical periods in the crop rotation could nevertheless be identified for the two soil types. While P leaching is of major importance on clay soils, sandy soils are strongly susceptible to N leaching. From the present study it could be concluded, that key factors for reducing N and P leaching from clay soils are late ploughing, avoidance of early incorporation of clover-grass leys in order to sow a winter cereal, the use of <b>undersown</b> <b>crops</b> and an even distribution of nutrients within the crop rotation.

40|$|Agriculture has {{transformed}} {{over the past}} centuries dramatically to become highly dependent on non-renewable fossil fuels, synthetic fertilizers and plant protection agents. This often occurs {{at the cost of}} soil degradation and soil food web disturbance. Future agriculture must not only be productive but also provide ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, pest and disease suppression, nutrient cycling and water storage to become sustainable in the long-term. Sustainability is especially fostered by reduced tillage and the presence of a permanent layer of plant residues. Under such conditions, soil compaction is reduced, soil structure improved, water infiltration enhanced, soil organic content increased and microbial activity stimulated. However, continuous soil cover, especially associated with permanent growth of plants, might also enhance plant-parasitic nematode densities due to permanent food supply. The effect of minimum tillage on nematode dynamics was studied within the EU-funded project “Optimizing subsidiary crop applications in rotations”. The rotation consisted of clover-grass, winter wheat, cover crop, and potato. The following treatments were studied: Plough versus minimum tillage, white clover versus subterranean clover as <b>undersown</b> <b>crops</b> in winter wheat, vetch versus a 1 : 4 mix of fodder radish and black oats as cover crop following winter wheat, and with and without 5 t DM ha- 1 compost application.

As known from previous experiments, maize and beans have a very low competitiveness against weeds, due to their relative slow youth development. Therefore, the beans were sown subsequently to the mechanical weed control with harrow and hoe, at the 4 -leaf development stage (BBCH 14) of maize. Hence a mechanical weed control after bean emergence is critical, a field experiment is conducted {{to find out whether}} the establishment of an additional catch crop can reduce weed pressure substantially. For this purpose two catch crop mixtures are evaluated in pure maize plots as well as in intercropping plots with scarlet runner beans (Phaseolus coccineus, cv. Preisgewinner) or common runner beans (Phaseolus vulgaris, cv. Tarbais) respectively. As control variants, plots without undersown crops were used. The <b>undersown</b> <b>crop</b> mixtures are composed of Italian ryegrass (cv. Gersimi, sowing density: 15 kg ha- 1), which is combined with subterranean clover (cv.

The highest biomass (50 g DM m- 2) was produced by US 1 in all variants, while the biomass of US 2 was significantly lower with 32 g DM m- 2. As a result of a successful mechanical weed control as well as a good development of the main crops, the weed pressure in 2014 was generally low.

This is necessary in order to overcome the soil-depletion effect of nitrogen uptake induced by the catch crop. Simulations showed that incorporation of catch crop material in late autumn instead of spring can result in a time distribution of nitrogen mineralization more suitable for a subsequent cereal crop, but this was not verified by the results of the lysimeter experiment. It seems important to obtain further knowledge of how to improve the degree of synchronization between nitrogen mineralization after incorporation of catch crops and nitrogen demand of the subsequent crops.

Moreover, the content of 0 -dihydroxyphenols in the soil was compared in the last year of the study. The soil used to prepare the solutions came from a field experiment established on medium heavy mixed rendzina soil. Spring wheat, cv.

Germination energy of the seeds watered with the soil extracts from the ploughed plots was significantly higher than this trait in the seeds watered with the extracts from the conservation tillage treatments with spring disking of the catch crops. Germination energy and capacity of spring wheat in the control treatment watered with distilled water were significantly higher compared to the other treatments under evaluation. Spring wheat watered with the aqueous extract prepared from the soil obtained from the plough tillage treatment produced a significantly longer first leaf compared to the treatments in which both conservation tillage methods had been used.

40|$|The {{essential}} {{difference between}} stockless and stocked systems {{is that the}} fertility building clover ley and other “forage crops” are not processed through an animal but instead are grown as green manures which are returned directly to the soil by mulching, incorporation or occasionally through composting of the green manure. Stockless systems provide no opportunity {{for the creation of}} straw and animal manure based farm yard manure or compost. While there is no research evidence that the lack of animals or manure based compost affects overall soil fertility and crop yield, there is some research evidence that animal manure enhances soil mychorrizae populations and soil organic matter accumulation. This effect might also be seen from the use of plant based compost, sometimes sourced off-farm as “green waste” in stockless systems, but there is no comparative work available. While the use of manures has the advantage of allowing movement of fertility around the farm within a rotation, grazing animals have the drawback of uneven dispersal of manure and urine and manure storage is liable to poor management and loss of nutrients. Green manures are fundamental to stockless systems, both as one or two year crops which are either mulched or incorporated or grown as short term catch <b>crops</b> or <b>undersown</b> <b>crops.</b> With appropriate selection and management of green manures there is potential for enhanced fertility building over that which is possible with grazed leys. The practical commercial experience of farmers using stockless rotations is stronger than the research would suggest in terms of supporting its technical success and viability. Weed control remains a serious problem for arable farms which requires very high standards of management. The demand for organic livestock products is increasing and the area of organic land producing feed grains is insufficient to support the required expansion. World demand for organic grains is increasing. The introduction of livestock on to specialist conventional cereal producing farms in many instances requires prohibitively expensive infrastructure costs. Stockless rotations utilising green manures to fix nitrogen as part of the rotation provide a technically feasible and profitable alternative. Stockless horticultural systems operated with or without the use of imported manure or compost offer potential for technically and financially viable systems provided that there is an appropriate balance of fertility building green manures and cash crops...|$|R

The objective of this thesis was to develop guidelines on how to prevent grain yield losses due to competition from the perennial crops or to increase the yield of the main crops. The effects of species and time of undersowing of perennial crops in spring cereals, and the management of an intercropping system in which winter oilseed rape or consecutive crops of winter wheat were established in a remaining crop of white clover, were studied. The biomass of <b>undersown</b> cover <b>crops</b> {{by the time of}} the harvest of spring barley was significantly reduced with each delay in the undersowing, but the increase in biomass during autumn was generally not affected. Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) reduced the grain yield by 6 and 1 %, respectively, but may both be suitable as cover crops with the appropriate main crop, time of undersowing and seed rate. Undersown white clover (Trifolium repens L.) /perennial ryegrass mixtures kept soil mineral N as low as pure ryegrass and improved the residual effect. This suggests that clover in the cover crops may reduce the N fertiliser requirements of the succeeding crop without increased N leaching. Grain yields were smaller in the wheat/clover system than with wheat alone when the wheat was direct drilled and larger when sown after stubble cultivation. Direct drilled wheat and rape yielded more with clover varieties less adapted to the cold climate than with varieties in common use in the area. Grain yield increased, weeds were efficiently controlled and the white clover crop maintained by applying herbicides that mainly act as germination inhibitors when a third consecutive wheat crop had 1 – 2 leaves. It was possible to conclude that (1) the tillage performed in conjunction with the sowing of wheat, (2) the weed control practice, and (3) the choice of clover variety, have large effects on the yield of the winter annuals in the intercropping system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} of agroforestry for industrialised countries can be furthered by {{an understanding of}} the history and present functioning of traditional systems. In temperate Europe, fruit trees were traditionally grown on agricultural land <b>undersown</b> with <b>crops</b> or managed grass-land (Streuobst). The historical evolution of this agroforestry system has been driven by the interaction of technical progress, market development and intervention by public authorities. Streuobst reached its peak in the 1930 s, but has since been in continuous decline due to the {{development of}} intensively managed dwarf-tree orchards. However, even today, it still occupies approximately one million hectares in 11 European countries and has a strong impact on the European fruit market. The profitability of streuobst is relatively poor due to its low labour productivity, but it has advantageous ecological and socio-cultural features, particularly in terms of biological diversity and landscape aesthetics. Accordingly, it finds strong acceptance among the general public, such that subsidised eradication programs have been abandoned and, in a number of countries, streuobst is now supported by non-governmental organisations and by state conservation policies. Modern agroforestry in temperate, industrialised countries should be oriented towards the creation of similar ecological and socio-cultural benefits in order to receive public support as a land-use system...|$|R
40|$|The {{cropping}} of leguminous {{cover crops}} usually leads to higher yields in subsequent cereals. The economic efficiency of leguminous cover crops was calculated in several field trials. Criterion was the yield (with adjusted costs) from the succeeding crops winter triticale and spring oats, respectively, after different leguminous cover <b>crops</b> <b>undersown</b> or as stubble seed {{in comparison to}} a control plot without cover crop. Thereby, the costs for seeds and the variable machine costs were taken into account. The highest yield was reached for both types of grain following undersown white clover, the second highest following undersown black medic. In contrast, the yield was lower following red clover and grass-clover undersowings as well as different stubble seeds. In parts of these variants, the yield was even lower than in the control without cover crop. ...|$|R
40|$|Weed species easily {{establish}} in crops with {{a similar}} life cycle. Especially mono-cropping provides best conditions for such weeds. In maize {{this is true for}} Echinochloa crus-galli, which is a C 4 plant and one of the worst weeds worldwide. In Germany E. crus-galli {{is one of the few}} typical weed species in maize. When recurrent herbicide treatments are applied, development of herbicide resistance is likely. Since maize is typically only treated once with herbicides, later germinating weeds can escape and produce seeds. These escaping weeds are not selected for herbicide resistance. Hence, they still have a more sensitive gene pool. E. crus-galli emerges with the highest density in spring and continues to germinate over the whole vegetative period of maize. In that way the early germinating biotypes are selected for herbicide resistance while the later germinating biotypes are not. To avoid the reproduction of E. crus-galli effort is made to suppress these later germinating weeds. Using <b>undersown</b> cover <b>crops</b> is one way to do that. We hypothesize that suppressing the later germinating biotypes enhances the development of herbicide resistance. We simulated the development of herbicide resistance in populations of E. crus-galli, composed of sensitive and resistant biotypes, in a continuous maize cropping system. We used the model PROSPER for our simulations. We assumed three levels of suppression of the later germinating weeds (0...|$|R
40|$|The study {{presents}} {{results of}} a series of trials investigating the effects of undersowing nitrogen fixing crops (legumes) into winter wheat on the performance of the subsequent crop winter triticale. Trials were carried out between 2003 and 2006 at two sites in southern Bavaria, Germany. All species tested - black medic, birdsfoot trefoil, red clover, white clover and a legume-grass mixture - proved to be suitable. Compared to the “not-undersown” control treatment the <b>undersown</b> N-fixing <b>crops</b> had no statistically significant effect on the yield, protein content and other grain quality characteristics of the winter wheat crop, except for one site where protein yield was significantly higher in one year. There was also no difference in disease incidence between “undersown” and “not-undersown” winter wheat. Depending on the seasonal rainfall pattern the establishment of N-fixing crops in wheat had either a negative or a positive effect on the yield of the subsequent crop of winter triticale. Reductions in yield only occurred in the 03 / 04 season, which had an extremely dry summer in 2003. In the seasons 04 / 05 and 05 / 06, which had a more favourable distribution of annual precipitation, the establish¬ment of certain legume crops increased the yield and protein content of winter triticale; however the effect was not statistically significant for all years and sites...|$|R
40|$|The FASSET farm {{model was}} used to {{simulate}} production in an experiment where a grass-clover or a grass ley was either cut or grazed with dairy cows receiving low or high N sup-plements. The six different ley types were ploughed in and followed by three years with spring cereals with <b>undersown</b> catch <b>crops.</b> The original model was extended with a new grass and clover model, which included the capability to simulate rhizodeposition and root growth. The new model predicted the observed annual carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) production satisfactorily. The simulated first year residual effects of a cut grass or grass-clover ley varied between 0 and 34, while the residual effect of a grazed grass or grass-clover ley varied between 71 and 150 fertilizer equivalents (kg N ha- 1). Second and third year residual effects of the grazed leys were ca. 40 and 9 fertilizer equiva-lents, respectively, while the residual effects of the cut leys were ca. 5 and 3 fertilizer equiva-lents. The effects of the different treatments on nitrate leaching were simulated quite satisfacto-rily. However, there was a deviation between the simulated and observed absolute level and timing of nitrate concentrations in suction cups. Scenario analysis showed that this partly {{could be explained by}} problems with refractory soil organic matter and gross nitrogen miner-alization in soils with high C:N ratios. ...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{shortage}} of organic grains, and a need to develop organic production systems which ensure high and stable grain yields. Commercial organic grain production is mainly a task for farms with few or no livestock, and the development of well functioning strategies for nutrient supply and weed control in commercial organic cereal production under such conditions, is a considerable scientific challenge. The nutrient losses should be minimized and grain yields maintained at economically satisfactory levels over time. A promising strategy involves undersowing of clover in grains where yields can be taken and nitrogen (N) be supplied simultaneously. The main objective of this project was to evaluate if repeated undersowing of clover is a well functioning green manuring strategy to obtain high and stable cereal yield on stockless organic farms. Further goals were to quantify effects of repeated undersowing of clover on grain yields and: 1) Field N balance, 2) Mobilization of soil mineral phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) and 3) Weed infestation. Two systems for N supply to organic spring grains were compared at Bioforsk Arable Crop Division, Apelsvoll and Kise in central south east Norway. Both systems consisted of cover crops which are grown {{for the benefit of the}} soil and/or other plants. Repeated undersowing of clover in the grains in four consecutive growing seasons (2002 – 2005) was compared to a treatment with whole-season green manure in the second year. The residual effect of all treatments was measured in 2006. The use of legumes, undersown in grains as well as used as a whole-season green manure, significantly increased the subsequent grain yield in an organic production system with no other fertilizers applied. The average grain yield over four years was larger with continuous undersowing than with a whole season green manure in the second year of the period. Hence, in organic stockless grain production systems it seems to be a better option to harvest cereals each year with undersown legumes, than to use a whole growing season each fourth year to produce nutrients for subsequent grains. However, when legumes are included in most years of the crop rotation, there is a risk that plant health problems may arise, such as nematodes or fungi. No beneficial effects of repeated clover undersowing was recorded with regard to control of annual weeds. However, the expected competitive effect of the undersowing on the weeds may have been obscured by an increased N supply from the undersown clover. Not only the grain plants, but also the weeds responded with increased growth when clover was grown in the previous season. In an experiment addressing perennial weeds it was shown that the <b>undersown</b> <b>crops</b> may retard the growth of sowthistle. With respect to soil tillage, shallow ploughing and rotary tilling in the autumn will retard the growth of perennial weeds, especially Canada thistle and coach grass...|$|R
40|$|All-arable {{organic farming}} systems, {{especially}} when they are working without organic fertilizer, are often in challenge with their nutrient management {{to fulfill the requirements}} of crops. In this context one of the main issues is to mitigate nutrient losses. Here the use of catch crops may one strategy to counteract against this. We hypothesized that under the climate conditions of north-west Germany winter hard catch crops are more suitable to reduce nitrogen (N) losses than catch crops killed by frost, here especially with cereals or legumes as previous crop. In a field experiment in 2015 / 16 we tested 3 different catch crops (grown in pure stand and in mixture with legumes) after peas and triticale for their nitrogen loss paths over the winter period. Soil mineral N content (0 - 90 cm) was determined before and after winter. Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions were measured weekly. Nitrate (NO 3) concentrations in leachate were analyzed once a week (Oct-Mar). The results show that corn legumes as pre crop have the highest N-loss potential over winter. In comparison, catch crops demonstrate a good reduction of nitrogen losses pathways like NO 3 in leachate or gaseous N 2 O emissions. In particular significant lower nitrate losses via leaching were recorded after corn as pre crop. In comparison winter killed white mustard showed significant higher NO 3 and N 2 O losses over winter. <b>Undersown</b> catch <b>crops</b> showed the highest potential to mitigate N-losses...|$|R

In each of the crop rotations was made five treatments concerning grazing/cutting strategy and manure application. Results shows that herbage production was high in year 1 - 4 of grass-clover.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects on}} annual weeds of location, weed control, manure application and catch crops and their interactions in a crop rotation with cereals and pulses for grain during conversion to organic farming {{in order to better}} understand the combined effects of management. An experiment with a four-year crop rotation (spring barley/undersown ley, grass-clover, winter wheat, pea/barley) was carried out from 1997 to 2000 under organic conditions at three locations in Denmark with four treatments: with and without catch crop, and with and without manure. Mechanical weed control was reduced or absent in cereals or pulses with <b>undersown</b> catch <b>crops</b> or grass-clover. Manure application increased weed biomass, but not the proportion of total biomass that was weed biomass, indicating that crop as well as weeds benefited from manure. The effect of catch crop on weed biomass was linked to weed control, while direct effects of catch crops on weed biomass were of minor importance. At the location with most intensive weed control, weed biomass decreased in all crops over the years. At the two other locations, weed biomass was stable or increased slightly in winter wheat and pea/barley, in which some weed control was performed, but increased in spring barley where no weed control was performed. Catch crops reduced weed density. The entry point of the rotation, i. e. the crop {{at the start of the}} rotation in 1997, had a significant influence on mean weed biomass, but it differed between locations and could mostly be explained by differences in weed biomass between years and crops. This suggests that experiments that do not include all crops in the rotation every year may give biased results. Effect of management practices (manure, catch crop and weed control) was specific to sites, but with similar effects in the different crops at each location...|$|R

We investigated nutrient dynamics and feed production in two dairy crop rotations with internal differences in proportion of grazing and cutting.

40|$|<b>Undersown</b> cover <b>crop</b> species {{introduced}} for weed management purposes should ideally combine adequate {{weed suppression}} with only marginal negative competitive {{effects on the}} main crop. The aim {{of this research was}} to identify the growth characteristics of clover species that determine weed suppressive ability and competitive ability against the main crop. In addition, the variation in these characteristics among clover species was determined, to identify whether species selection is {{an important component of the}} optimization of living mulch systems. In 2001, a field experiment was conducted in which weed suppression and competitive ability against leek of eight clover types was determined. Based on the results, three contrasting clover types were selected and their weed suppressive ability was further investigated in a field experiment conducted in 2002. Results of both experiments were related to growth characteristics that were simultaneously determined and described in a previous paper. Correlation analysis showed that the competitive effect of clover on transplanted leek was strongly correlated with maximum canopy height, indicating that yield reduction was mainly caused by competition for light. Subterranean clover, being the shortest species, gave inadequate weed suppression, whereas all other species were found to provide at least reasonable weed suppression. Subterranean clover reduced individual leek plant dry weight more strongly (60 %) than expected based on its canopy height. Indications were found that this clover species was hindering the uptake of nitrogen by leek. Clover species with superior weed suppression, like Persian clover, red clover, alsike clover, berseem clover and crimson clover also gave the strongest negative effect on dry matter accumulation of leek (reductions between 70 % and 90 %). White clover was found to give the best compromise between adequate weed suppression and mild yield reduction, though also with this species reduction in leek plant dry weight was still 60 %. It was concluded that for optimization of systems that introduce clover species as a weed suppressing cover crop species selection is important element, though additional management to restrict the competitive effect on the main crop remains a requirement...|$|R
40|$|Weeds often form a {{major problem}} in weakly {{competitive}} vegetable crops, particularly in low input systems. <b>Undersown</b> cover <b>crops</b> can be used to suppress weeds, but often put too high a competitive pressure on the main crop. Cover crop selection is one of the potential means {{that can be used to}} design or optimize these intercropping systems. The objective of the current research was to investigate the variability among a range of clover species in morphological and physiological traits that are considered relevant for interplant competition. To this purpose, field experiments with pure stands of eight clover species (2001) and a selection of three clover species (2002) were conducted, in which regular observations and periodic harvests were taken. Clear differences in the time in which full soil cover was obtained, total accumulated biomass, growth duration, height development and N-accumulation were observed. Persian clover (Trifolium resupinatum L.) and subterranean clover (T. subterraneum L.) were the two most contrasting species in this study, particularly differing in the period in which full soil cover was obtained. Persian clover's faster soil cover could not be attributed to a single trait, but resulted from a number of intrinsic characteristics, like light extinction coefficient, light use efficiency and specific leaf area that together determine the relative growth rate. The study also demonstrated the importance of differences in relative starting position, caused by, for instance, seed size, seeding rate and fraction establishment, for the analysis of early growth characteristics. Alsike clover (T. hybridum L.), berseem clover (T. alexandrinum L) and crimson clover (T. incarnatum L.) developed slower than Persian clover, but all produced a higher amount of accumulated dry matter, due to a longer growing period. Clear differences in height and height development between species were observed. These differences were not associated with dry matter accumulation, as the tallest (red clover; 80 cm) and the shortest species (subterranean clover; 12 cm) produced similar amounts of dry matter. A strong positive correlation between early soil cover development and N-accumulation was observed. The large variability among clover species indicates that species selection is a very important aspect of the development of cropping systems that include clover as a cover crop...|$|R
