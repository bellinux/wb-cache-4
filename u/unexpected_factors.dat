40|$|This study {{investigated}} the German experience in {{the transition to a}} unified health care system and suggests the following implica-tions for Korea. First, Germany could have made use of the unification process better {{if there had been a}} good road map. Therefore Korea must develop a well prepared road map that considers all possible situations. Second, Germany saw an opportunity for the im-provement of the health care system in the early stage of unification but could not take advantage of it because the situation changed dramatically and they had not sufficiently prepared for it. Korea should take into account the opportunity for improvement of the present health care system, such as the roles of public health and traditional medicine. Thirdly, the conditions f North Korea seem to be far worse than those of former East Germany and also worse than even those of other transition countries. Therefore Korea should design a long-term road map taking as many variables into account as possible, including the different rigid way of thinking and the interrelationship among the social sectors. Fourthly, during the German reunification <b>unexpected</b> <b>factors</b> changed the direction of the events. Korea should have a separate plan for the <b>unexpected</b> <b>factors...</b>|$|E

40|$|The current paper delineates {{a modern}} {{algorithmic}} procedure for estimating {{the risk and}} calculating a realistic duration of interrupted critical computerized business activities, in order to mitigate or prevent their corresponding negative consequences. The contribution is formulated via merging risk management and business continuity concepts. The formulation of an integrated business continuity management policy includes the proactive determination of approximate recovery timeframes for critical business functions. Practically, this estimation is based on recovery tests which are executed under ideal conditions, and <b>unexpected</b> <b>factors</b> which may emerge during a real process interruption and signifi cantly delay its recovery are ignored. Agriculture is a domain where the incorporation of an integrated business continuity management system is a crucial issue. The interruption of agricultural computerized activities can be triggered by and can result to various undesirable environmental phenomena. Thus, especially for agriculture, the consideration of <b>unexpected</b> <b>factors</b> when executing recovery tests is highly demanded. The currently presented algorithm accepts as initial input the estimated recovery time {{which is based on}} recovery exercises executed under ideal conditions. Then, a precise number of potential unpredictable hazards (factors) are taken into consideration and the risk magnitude of each threat is semi-quantitatively estimated. The total risk magnitude is utilized to estimate the time deviation from the initially defi ned recovery time. After the risk analysis process is terminated, a new recovery timeframe is proposed. The time deviation from the initially defi ned recovery time is calculated in its absolute value. The algorithm is fi nally validated by applying the calculated extended timeframe to the system availability formula which measures the achieved system availability levels for any information system. The validation of the approach is demonstrated via a practical case study from the agricultural domain, namely the greenhouse irrigation scheduling system interruption scenario...|$|E
40|$|The {{current work}} aims to the {{development}} of the Business Continuity Testing Points method which can help both IT as well as business managers define an efficient business continuity strategy. The BCTP method stems from the UML Use Case Points theory which is a practically tested and accepted approach to SW complexity estimation. The Use Case Points methodology was selected as the theory behind the construction of the BCTP model, due to the fact that firstly, both theories share the requirement analysis task and secondly because complexity of information systems is strongly related to their recovery in cases of their unexpected failovers. In the Use Case Points theory IT analysts perform software requirement analysis by executing various business scenarios. The BCTP theory, on the other hand, is constructed to support the analysis of IT system recovery requirements, by executing multiple efficient recovery scenarios. The method is a new approach to the objective determination of the Recovery Time Effort of a business function in comparison to the Rational Time Objective and the Maximum Acceptable Outage, which are defined with regard to the Impact Value Level of the function. The most critical functions of the enterprise should be included in the Minimum Business Continuity Objective (MBCO) concept. MBCO refers to vital business functions without which the enterprise is not able to perform its basic operations. The Recovery Time Effort of a given business function is affected by multiple Technical, Environmental and <b>Unexpected</b> <b>factors</b> with precise weights and assessment values.

The intrapersonal and interpersonal coping strategies and the social/emotional competencies reported by the mediators are discussed, as is another <b>unexpected</b> <b>factor</b> which emerged: the need for political competence. Mediators must be ‘powerful’ in managing the use of power, {{in order to achieve}} ‘empowerment’ of the disputants.

But there was an <b>unexpected</b> <b>factor</b> that finally took the lead and cast its mighty shadow over the other songs: a musical joke which Valdobrev created together with friend and colleague Kamen Donev {{on their way back}} from a theatre tour in Vienna. Tired of the long and boring trip they took a bunch of keys for percussion and started rapping over a three chord country-like gypsy tune I love you, my dear. Back in Sofia they recorded the song in less than an hour, adding the characteristic voice of their colleague, the young actress Maya Bejanska. Although this ditty was totally different from anything in the album, it was so catchy that the producers decided to release it as a single. In no time it became vastly popular and later gave its name to the album that sold over 130,000 copies. This success almost obliged Stefan, Kamen and Maya to repeat this direction. And in 1996 they joined for a single project - an album called Revolution. It was based on folklore and gypsy songs and used many ethno instruments and elements in a rock context. Meanwhile, in 1995 Valdobrev released a collection of his scores for theatre performances called A Night at the Theatre.|$|R

It is common knowledge that even small modifications of the reaction parameters during synthesis can alter {{the characteristics of the}} resulting nano-objects. In this work we report an <b>unexpected</b> <b>factor</b> which determines the structure of cobalt nanoparticles. Nanocrystals of distinctly different sizes and shapes have resulted from stock solutions containing exactly the same concentrations of [Co{N(SiMe(3)) (2) }(2) (thf) ], hexadecylamine, and lauric acid. The reduction reaction itself has been performed under identical conditions. In an effort to explain these differences and to analyze the reaction components and any molecular intermediates, we have discovered that {{the rate at which the}} cobalt precursor is added to the ligand solution during the stock solution preparation at room temperature becomes determinant by triggering off a nonanticipated side reaction which consumes part of the lauric acid, the main stabilizing ligand, transforming it to a silyl ester. Thus, an innocent mixing, apparently not related to the main reaction which produces the nanoparticles, becomes the parameter which in fine defines nanocrystal characteristics. This side reaction affects in a similar way the morphology of iron nanoparticles prepared from an analogous iron precursor and the same long chain stabilizing ligands. Side reactions are potentially operational in a great number of systems yielding nanocrystals, despite the fact that they are very rarely mentioned in the literature...|$|R

BackgroundNoninvasive cardiac {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) quantifies absolute flow and coronary flow reserve (CFR), thereby defining physiological severity of coronary artery disease for clinical studies or management. Defining “normal” coronary flow is a necessary prerequisite to its broad clinical application. MethodsVolunteers aged 20 to 40 years of age without cardiac disease or other conditions underwent rest–dipyridamole stress cardiac PET with absolute quantitative flow measurements using Rb- 82 in paired studies at least 7 days apart for reproducibility. The presence of coronary calcium, detectable blood nicotine or caffeine, dyslipidemia, and an extended family history of early clinical atherosclerosis were objectively and systematically examined for grouping subjects as true normal or not normal. ResultsWe enrolled 125 volunteers, 107 (86 %) underwent 2 PET scans. Fifty-six (45 %) were classified as true normal, whereas 69 (55 %) were classified as not normal. True normals had higher high-density lipoprotein and less PET scan heterogeneity. Hemodynamic responses to dipyridamole stress were similar. Rest flow was the same in both groups (0. 72 ± 0. 17 ml/min/g vs. 0. 69 ± 0. 14 ml/min/g, p = 0. 164). However, stress flow (2. 89 ± 0. 50 ml/min/g vs. 2. 63 ± 0. 61 ml/min/g, p = 0. 005) and CFR (4. 17 ± 0. 80 vs. 3. 91 ± 0. 86, p = 0. 047) were higher in true normals. Paired studies were performed a median of 22 days (interquartile range: 15 to 39) apart. Reproducibility was improved in the true normal group.
