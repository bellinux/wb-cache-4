2500|$|Leno faced heated {{criticism}} and increasing negative publicity for his perceived {{role in the}} timeslot conflict, with some critics predicting that his reputation—along with those of Jeff Zucker and NBC as a whole—had been permanently damaged by the incident. Critics pointed to the 2004 Tonight Show clip, wherein Leno claimed he would allow O'Brien to take over without incident. Actor and comedian Patton Oswalt {{was among the first}} celebrities to openly voice disappointment with Leno, saying, [...] "Comedians who don't like Jay Leno now, and I'm one of them, we're not like, 'Jay Leno sucks;' it's that we're so hurt and disappointed that one of the best comedians of our generation... willfully has shut the switch off." [...] Rosie O'Donnell has been among O'Brien's most vocal and vehement supporters, calling Leno a [...] "bully" [...] and his recent actions [...] "classless and kind of career-defining". Howard Stern was also a harsh critic of Leno before and following the timeslot change announcement; Stern appeared on Late Night in 2006, and told O'Brien that he felt it was unlikely that Leno would ever willingly give <b>up</b> <b>Tonight</b> to anyone. The 67th Golden Globe Awards, which aired on NBC during the heat of O'Brien's settlement negotiations on January 17, featured numerous jokes on the controversy by Tina Fey, Tom Hanks, and show host Ricky Gervais: [...] "Let's get on with it before NBC replaces me with Jay Leno." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harlan Ellison's {{original}} {{version of the}} teleplay won the annual Writers Guild of America Award for [...] Justman later said that the submission of the original unfilmed version was out of spite, and Roddenberry said {{in response to the}} victory [...] "many people would get prizes if they wrote scripts that budgeted out to three times the show's cost." [...] The WGA rules allow only the credited writers to submit scripts for consideration, who may submit whichever draft of theirs that they may choose. It was up against another Star Trek episode, nominated by the production team; [...] "The Return of the Archons". Coon reportedly said at the time: [...] "If Harlan wins, I'm going to die", and that [...] "there are two scripts <b>up</b> <b>tonight</b> for the Writers' Guild Award, and I wrote them both." [...] On the night, Roddenberry and several of the crew were seated at a table which Desilu had purchased, while Ellison was at another. When he won, the Star Trek party rose to their feet and applauded, since they believed it would bring credibility to the series. Herbert Franklin Solow later recalled that this elation turned to horror when Ellison began talking about the interference of studio executives in the writing process, before holding aloft a copy of the original script and yelling [...] "Remember, never let them rewrite you!" [...] Ellison walked past the Desilu table as he left the podium, and shook the copy of the script at Roddenberry and his party.|$|E

The protracted and wearing anxiety and expense {{of the law in}} its most oppressive form, its torture from hour to hour, its weary days and sleepless nights, with these I'll prove you, and break your haughty spirit, strong as you deem it now. And when you make this house a hell, and visit these trials upon yonder wretched object (as you will; I know you), and those who think you now a young-fledged hero, we'll go into old accounts between us two, and see who stands the debtor, and comes out best at last, even before the world.' ...|$|E

I suppose she has lost it and is afraid to own up for fear she'll be punished. It's a dreadful thing to think she tells falsehoods. It's a far worse thing than her fit of temper. It's a fearful responsibility {{to have a child}} in your house you can't trust. Slyness and untruthfulness--that's what she has displayed. I declare I feel worse about that than about the brooch. If she'd only have told the truth about it I wouldn't mind so much." ...|$|E
