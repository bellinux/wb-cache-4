Oliphant discovered to his dismay that the reports and other documents sent directly to Briggs had not been shared with all members of the committee; Briggs had locked them in a safe. Oliphant then met with Allison, Coolidge, Conant and Fermi to explain the <b>urgency.</b> <b>In</b> these meetings Oliphant spoke of an atomic bomb with forcefulness and certainty, and explained that Britain did not have the resources to undertake the project alone, so it was up to the United States.|$|E

The RATG was the last EATS group to be formed, but the first to start training airmen; it also turned out fully qualified pilots before any of the others, doing so for the first time in November 1940.|$|E

5|$|The {{leadership}} of the Polish Jews was aware that Bełżec and Treblinka had been closed, dismantled and all remaining prisoners {{had been sent to}} the gas-chambers and they suspected that Sobibor would be next. There was a great <b>urgency</b> <b>in</b> coming up with a good escape plan, and Pechersky, with his army experience, was their best hope. The escape had to also coincide with the time when the Sobibor's deputy commandant Gustav Wagner went on vacation, since the prisoners felt that he was sharp enough to uncover the escape plan.|$|E
5|$|Land {{transport}} {{utilized the}} advanced system of Roman roads. The in-kind taxes paid by communities included {{the provision of}} personnel, animals, or vehicles for the cursus publicus, the state mail and transport service established by Augustus. Relay stations were located along the roads every seven to twelve Roman miles, and tended to grow into a village or trading post. A mansio (plural mansiones) was a privately run service station franchised by the imperial bureaucracy for the cursus publicus. The support staff at such a facility included muleteers, secretaries, blacksmiths, cartwrights, a veterinarian, and a few military police and couriers. The distance between mansiones was determined by how far a wagon could travel in a day. Mules were the animal most often used for pulling carts, travelling about 4mph. As {{an example of the}} pace of communication, it took a messenger a minimum of nine days to travel to Rome from Mainz in the province of Germania Superior, even on a matter of <b>urgency.</b> <b>In</b> addition to the mansiones, some taverns offered accommodations as well as food and drink; one recorded tab for a stay showed charges for wine, bread, mule feed, and the services of a prostitute.|$|E
5|$|The first {{installment}} of the story-based DLC The Knife of Dunwall was praised for its level design, which encouraged exploration to find hidden content and alternative routes through areas. The modifications to certain abilities, particularly Blink were similarly well received for the changes they brought to the gameplay from the main game. The story, however, was generally criticized. Polygon noted that the deadly assassin Daud had no motive for seeking redemption, and allowing him to be played as a non-lethal character created a disconnect with the narrative. IGN considered that it felt like only half of a complete game, lacking any <b>urgency</b> <b>in</b> its story and featuring a disappointing conclusion. The Brigmore Witches story received a mixed response, with Destructoid saying that it offered a more gripping narrative, while Polygon stated that it lacked the same tension as The Knife of Dunwall, and the ending felt rushed and unsatisfying. However, the gameplay was generally considered an improvement, providing more intricate level design and nuanced world building that produced gameplay requiring a more thoughtful approach. PC Gamer appreciated that the levels each had a distinct theme, and adequately provided for both stealth and violent gameplay, while Polygon said that only the last level improved over the preceding DLC, introducing new mechanics that forced changes in stealth players.|$|E

25|$|The {{conflicting}} {{forces of}} Arab nationalism and the Zionist movement created a situation which the British could neither resolve nor extricate themselves from. Pogroms in Russia and the Ukraine {{as well as}} Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany created a new <b>urgency</b> <b>in</b> the Zionist movement to create a Jewish state, and the evident intentions of the Zionists provoked increasingly fierce Arab resistance and attacks against the Jewish population (most notably in the preceding 1929 Hebron massacre, {{the activities of the}} Black Hand, and during the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine). The British-appointed Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, led opposition to the idea of turning part of Palestine into a Jewish state.|$|E
25|$|While {{national}} service {{was introduced in}} 1967 in Singapore, it was solely geared towards the building up of the Singapore Armed Forces. There was little <b>urgency</b> <b>in</b> the police force to increase its manpower strength until the Laju incident in 1974 demonstrated {{the need for additional}} trained reserve officers who can be called up at short notice {{in the event of an}} emergency. National service was thus extended to the Singapore Police Force in 1975, with the primary aim of guarding key installations and to act as a reserve unit. Subsequent expansion of the scheme, changing security needs, and the trend in outsourcing installation protection (such as to the Auxiliary Police Forces) has expanded their role to more functions, which may range from administration, investigation to front-line policing alongside their regular counterparts.|$|E
25|$|This act {{begins by}} reestablishing {{the aura of}} romantic mystery which began Act 1. This is evoked {{by the use of}} high violins and wind chords together, similar to that of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring. The first {{movement}} is characterised by the constant change of tempo, while the second picks up influences from other musical styles in particular that of rhythmic impulse and swooning which characterised Ravel's work. The next movement features solid writing for a chorus of brass instruments, after which high violins are heard over a very low accompaniment. This section also features many solos for various instruments, followed by a pas de trois above a gently undulating accompaniment where lyrical melody lines are heard, with the oboe able to penetrate the whole texture in expressive fashion. The following variation is typical of 19th century ballet music and begins with the violins before spreading {{to the rest of the}} orchestra. Brass, prominent timpani and incisive pizzicato chords in the strings culminate in a sense of <b>urgency</b> <b>in</b> the music which prepares for the musical tension in the final act.|$|E

40|$|Mamoru Oshii’s war {{centered}} oeuvre {{offers a}} unique, prophetic and radical {{way of thinking}} about the relationship between war and peace. This dissertation focuses on his two animation films Patlabor 2 (1993) and The Sky Crawlers(2008), as their similarity and contrast can offer a critical entry for understanding his dynamic speculation of war. His works address the issues around electronics technology-aid warfare, media representation of war, video war game culture, religious ideology and so forth, which are of political <b>urgencies</b> <b>in</b> contemporary Japanese society and beyond. Central to the two films is the subject of war as a concurrent and fundamental reality as well as structure under the myth of peace or stability. These two films also serve as a critical reflection upon the theoretical issues arising from Michel Foucault’s genealogical writings on war and Jean Baudrillard’s account of simulation, symbolic exchange and death. published_or_final_versionLiterary and Cultural StudiesMasterMaster of Art...|$|R
