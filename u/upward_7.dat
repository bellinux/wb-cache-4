It {{is calculated}} as the discounted {{present value of}} the annuity’s expected future payments divided by its cost. We argue that, this measure may overestimate the value‐for‐money obtained by annuitants, since it does not adjust for liquidity or risk factors. Measuring these factors is challenging, requiring detailed knowledge of the annuity provider’s assets, liabilities, and of the stochastic processes followed by them. Using a multi‐factor continuous‐time model and option pricing theory, we propose a simple solution for an Adjusted MWR (AMWR), which does consider illiquidity and default risk. We implement this solution for the competitive Chilean annuity market, which offers unadjusted MWRs above 1, finding that indeed these ratios are biased <b>upward</b> <b>7</b> percent on average. We also present estimates of default option values, asset insufficiency probabilities and implied credit spreads for each annuity provider...|$|E

Heating distributions predicted with a parabolized Navier-Stokes (PNS) code are compared with the measurements for the present Reynolds numbers and range of angles of attack. Leeward heating was greatly affected by Reynolds number, with the heating increasing with decreasing Reynolds number for attached flow (low incidence). The opposite was true for separated flow, which occurred when the fore-cone angle of attack exceeded 0. 8 times the fore-cone half-angle.

It is not readily apparent why we were able to collect almost as many L. cinereus in one summer as have been collected in the past 59 years in Oklahoma. One explanation may be that the mist-netting technique we used was different than that used by previous collectors in Oklahoma. In addition to the traditional size (2. 1 m high x 5. 5 - 18. 3 m long) mist nets, we used a high mist net.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the accuracy of this technique for four physiological arm movements using opto-electronic markers mounted on scapular bone pins as a gold standard. Eight subjects had bone pins inserted into their lateral scapular spine. Three points were digitized on the scapula with an optoelectronic probe: the medial root of the scapular spine, the posterolateral corner of the acromion, and the inferior angle of the scapula. The four active movements tested in this study were glenohumeral abduction, glenohumeral horizontal adduction, hand behind back, and forward reaching. The three bony landmarks were digitized six times in three different positions for each movement. Data from one subject were rejected secondary to pin loosening. The overall position-specific r. m. s. errors ranged from 2. 0 u to 12. 5 u. The full abduction position had considerably higher r. m. s. errors than the other positions (posterior tipping, 12. 5 u; <b>upward</b> rotation, <b>7.</b> 3 u; internal rotation, 12. 0 u). It appears that the digitization of bony landmarks may be a valid method for measuring changes in scapular attitude with the following caveats: the full abduction position has a high r. m. s. error, and small scapular motions have high percen-tage errors...|$|R

The experimental design was a 2 x 2 factorial {{in a completely}} randomized design. The reference cyanide content of the cassava pulp determined immediately after grating was 437. 4 ± 15. 2 mg/kg. Results showed that the crude protein content of the fermented groups (Treatments 3 and 4) were {{higher than those of}} the unfermented groups (Treatments 1 & 2).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{develops a}} comprehensive theory of 2 ̆ 7 selective opacity 2 ̆ 7, syntactic configurations {{in which one}} and the same syntactic domain is transparent to some operations, but opaque to others. The prime example of selective opacity are finite clauses in English, which are transparent to A 2 ̆ 7 -movement, but opaque to A-movement. Following and extending the previous literature, I argue that selective opacity extends beyond the A/A 2 ̆ 7 -distinction and even to syntactic dependencies that do not involve movement. Empirically, I argue that selective opacity exhibits intriguing meta-generalizations, which become evident once selective opacity across constructions and languages is treated as a uniform phenomenon. These two meta-generalizations are what I call 2 ̆ <b>7</b> <b>Upward</b> Entailment 2 ̆ 7 and the 2 ̆ 7 Height-Locality Connection 2 ̆ <b>7.</b> <b>Upward</b> Entailment states that if a clause of a given structural size is opaque to some operation, then structurally larger clauses are likewise opaque to this operation. The Height-Locality Connection states that the locality of a movement type is related to the height of the landing site of that movement type within the clausal spine. Specifically, movement types that land in a structurally high position are able to escape more domains than movement types that target a lower position. The core theoretical proposal is that selective opacity is the manifestation of a constraint on the locality of probes. I propose that probes have characteristic 2 ̆ 7 horizons 2 ̆ 7, which delimit their search space. Crucially, horizons can differ between probes. As a result, the opacity of a domain can be relative to the probe conducting the search. I argue that this is what underlies locality differences between movement types, between movement and agreement, and between types of dependencies that do not involve movement. I demonstrate how a wide array of selective opacity effects and complex interactions between them can be derived. I also demonstrate how meta-generalizations of selective opacity emerge from the account. Finally, I explore the consequences of horizons for more familiar concepts of syntactic locality like phases. I show that horizons coexist with CP phases, but that they are incompatible with vP phases. Independent psycholinguistic evidence for this conclusion is provided and I reassess previous arguments in support of vP phases...|$|R
40|$|The {{thinning}} of the near-Earth current sheet {{during the}} growth {{phase of the}} Coordinated Data Analysis Workshop (CDAW) 6 magnetospheric substorm is studied. The expansion onset of the substorm occurred at 1054 UT, March 22, 1979. During the growth phase, two spacecraft, International Sun Earth Explorer (ISEE) 1 and ISEE 2, were within the current sheet approximately 13 R(sub E) from the Earth and obtained simultaneous high-resolution magnetic data at two points in the current sheet. Plasma data were also provided by the ISEE spacecraft and solar wind data by IMP 8. To facilitate the analysis, the GSM magnetic field data are transformed to a 'neutral sheet coordinate system' in which the new x axis {{is parallel to the}} average magnetic field above and below the neutral sheet and the new y axis lies in the GSM equatorial plane. A model {{based on the assumption that}} the current sheet is a time-invariant structure fails to predict neutral sheet crossing times. Consequently, the Harris sheet model, which allows one to remove the restriction of time invariancy, is used instead. It is found that during the growth phase, a model parameter corresponding to the thickness of the current sheet decreased exponentially from about 5 R(sub E) to 1 R(sub E) with a time constant of about 14 min. In addition, the ISEE 1 and ISEE 2 neutral sheet crossings after expansion onset indicate that the neutral sheet was moving <b>upward</b> at <b>7</b> km/s relative to the spacecraft. Since both crossings occurred in approximately 80 s, the current sheet thickness is estimated to be about 500 km.

40|$|The Tibetan Plateau (TP) {{is located}} at the {{juncture}} of several important natural and anthropogenic aerosol sources. Satellites have observed substantial dust and anthropogenic aerosols in the atmosphere during summer over the TP. These aerosols have distinct effects on the earth's energy balance, microphysical cloud properties, and precipitation rates. To investigate the transport of summer dust and anthropogenic aerosols over the TP, we combined the Spectral Radiation-Transport Model for Aerosol Species (SPRINTARS) with a non-hydrostatic regional model (NHM). The model simulation shows heavily loaded dust aerosols over the northern slope and anthropogenic aerosols over the southern slope and the east of the TP. The dust aerosols are primarily mobilized around the Taklimakan Desert, where a portion of the aerosols are transported eastward due to the northwesterly current; simultaneously, a portion of the particles are transported southward when a second northwesterly current becomes northeasterly because of the topographic blocking of the northern slope of the TP. Because of the strong upward current, dust plumes can extend <b>upward</b> to approximately <b>7</b> – 8 km a. s. l. over the northern slope of the TP. When a dust event occurs, anthropogenic aerosols that entrained into the southwesterly current via the Indian summer monsoon are transported from India to the southern slope of the TP. Simultaneously, a large amount of anthropogenic aerosol is also transported from eastern China to the east of the TP by easterly winds. An investigation on the transport of dust and anthropogenic aerosols over the plateau may provide the basis for determining aerosol impacts on summer monsoons and climate systems...|$|R

Our objective was to assess glenohumeral translations during shoulder rehabilitation exercises, activities of daily living, and sports activities to provide a preliminary analysis of glenohumeral arthrokinematics in {{a broad range of}} dynamic tasks. METHODS: Glenohumeral translations were computed from trajectories of markers fitted to intracortical pins inserted into the scapula and the humerus. Two participants (P 1 and P 2) performed full range-of-motion movements including maximum arm elevations and internal-external rotations rehabilitation exercises, six activities of daily living, and five sports activities. FINDINGS: During range-of-motion movements, maximum <b>upward</b> translation was <b>7.</b> 5 mm (P 1) and 4. 7 mm (P 2). Upward translation during elevations was smaller with the arm internally (3. 6 mm (P 1) and 2. 9 mm (P 2)) than neutrally (4. 2 mm (P 1) and 3. 7 mm (P 2)) and externally rotated (4. 3 mm (P 1) and 4. 3 mm (P 2)). For activities of daily living and sports activities, only anterior translation during reach axilla for P 1 and upward translation during ball throwing for P 2 were larger than the translation measured during range-of-motion movements (108 % and 114 %, respectively). INTERPRETATION: While previous electromyography-based studies recommended external rotation during arm elevation to minimize upward translation, measures of glenohumeral translations suggest that internal rotation may be better. Similar amplitude of translation during ROM movement and sports activities suggests that large excursions of the humeral head may be caused not only by fast movements, but also by large amplitude movements...|$|R

Stimuli were elliptical patches (2 deg horizontally by 1 deg vertically) of horizontal sinusoidal gratings of spatial. frequency 2 cycles/deg. Two sequential 380 msec reveal presentations were compared. One of each pair of gratings (the standard) moved at 4 Hz (2 deg/sec), the other (the test) moved at a rate determined by a simple up-down staircase. The point of subjectively equal speed was calculated from {{the average of the}} last eight reversals. The task was to fixate a central point and to determine which one of the pair appeared to move faster. Eight of 10 observers perceived the upward drifting grating as moving faster than a grating moving downward but otherwise identical. on average (N = 10), when the standard moved downward, it was matched by a test moving <b>upward</b> at 94. <b>7</b> +/- 1. 7 (SE) % of the standard speed, and when the standard moved upward it was matched by a test moving downward at 105. 1 +/- 2. 3 (SE) % of the standard speed. Extending this paradigm over a range of spatial (1. 5 to 13. 5 c/d) and temporal (1. 5 to 13. 5 Hz) frequencies, preliminary results (N = 4) suggest that, under the conditions of our experiment, upward matter is seen as faster than downward for speeds greater than approx. 1 deg/sec, but the effect appears to reverse at speeds below approx. 1 deg/sec with downward motion perceived as faster.

40|$|Basaltic eruptions {{have been}} {{observed}} to produce structurally complex, compound 'a'ā lava flow fields but their mor phometry has only rarely been systematically documented. We document the morphology and structures that developed during the emplacement of the 1982 basaltic lava flow field at Mount Cameroon (MC) volcano {{over a period of}} one month. Topographic cross-sections (13 in total) were made from the main vent (~ 2700 m above sea level (a. s. l)) down to a distance of 5. 5 km on the cooled lava surface. Details obtained from these cross-sections include: channel width and depth, levee slope, lava surface morphology and structures. These details enabled us to describe the physical char acteristics of the 1982 lava flow field. The inclined (12 ° - 19 °) underlying slopes on which this flow field was emplaced resulted in a characteristic channelized basaltic 'a'ā flow field morphology. This includes a proximal zone characterised by reduced flow width and depth with no subsidiary channels. Slab-crusted lava dominates the proximal channel dis tinctively bent into convex <b>upward</b> shapes. <b>7</b> secondary vents were observed for the first time ~ 2. 5 km from the main vent, with heights of 3 - 15 m. This is a very significant observation since it points {{to the fact that the}} flow field em placement may have been a product of 2 eruption sites as observed at other historical MC lava flow fields. This suppo sition was ruled out by further evidence obtained from other surface features within the flow field. The presence of these secondary vents still has an important bearing in lava flow hazard assessment. Field observations also revealed the presence of tumulus. This is a novel feature for MC lava flow fields. It displayed a close similarity to those observed at other basaltic volcanoes occurring in association with clinker 'a'ā lava, lava tubes, squeeze-ups and pressure ridges. Channels are well-defined, bounded by levees. Accretional and overflow levees dominate in this flow field. This lava flow-field attained a final length of 7. 5 km, an area of 2. 6 × 10 6 m 2 and volume of 1. 3 × 10 7 m 3. The presence of tumulus indicates internal inflation together with structures such as pressure ridges and squeeze-ups which are also attributed to compressive forces. Our observations suggest that real-time monitoring of compound lava flow fields evolution at MC may reveal the emplacement mechanisms of complex structures such as the secondary vents (~ 2180 - 2011 m a. s. l.) observed within the flow field. In addition, documenting the occurrence, morphology and link between lava tubes, tu mulus and squeeze-ups may allow us to determine the risk of reactivation of a stalled flow front. This will thereby en hance the ability to track and assess hazards posed by lava flow emplacement from MC-like volcanoes. </p...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: The time {{frequency}} analysis of non-stationary signals has been the&# 13; considerable research effort in recent years. Wavelet transform {{is one of}} the favored tool for the&# 13; analyzing the biomedical signals. Approach: We describe the identification of Electro-Oculograph (EOG) signals of eye movement potentials by using wavelet algorithm which gives a&# 13; lot of information than FFT. The capability of wavelet transform was to distribute the signal&# 13; energy with the change of time in different frequency bands. This will showed the characteristic of&# 13; the signals since energy was an important physical variable in signal analysis. The EOG signals&# 13; were captured using electrodes placed on the forehead around the eyes to record the eye&# 13; movements. The wavelet features used to determine the characteristic of eye movement waveform. &# 13; This technique adopted because it was a non-invasive, inexpensive and accurate. The new&# 13; technology enhancement has allowed the EOG signals captured using the Neuronal EEG- 9200. &# 13; The recorded data was composed of an eye movement toward four directions, i. e., downward,&# 13; upward, leftward and rightward. The proposed analysis for each eyes signal is analyzed by using&# 13; Wavelet Transform (WT) with energy algorithm and by comparing the energy distribution with&# 13; the change of time and frequency of each signal. Results: A wavelet Scalogram was plotted to&# 13; display the different percentages of energy for each wavelet coefficient towards different&# 13; movement. Conclusion: From the result, it is proved that the different EOG signals exhibit&# 13; differences in signals energy with their corresponding scale such as leftward with scale 6 (8 -&# 13; 16 Hz), rightward with scale 8 (2 - 4 Hz), downward with scale 9 (1 - 2 Hz) and <b>upward</b> with level <b>7</b> &# 13; (4 - 8 Hz). Statistically, the results in this study indicate that there are 93 % (averages) significance&# 13; differences in the extracted features of wavelet Scalogram analysis...|$|R

40|$|In 1991, Galanter and Palay {{published}} 2 ̆ 7 Tournament of Lawyers: The Transformation of the Big Law Firm 2 ̆ 7, which {{documented the}} regular and relentless growth of large U. S. law firms. The book advanced several structural and historical factors to explain these patterns, centering on {{the adoption of}} the promotion-to-partnership tournament. Systemic changes in the marketplace for corporate legal services in the intervening years suggest the need for an updated account of the modern large law firm. Using 2 ̆ 7 Tournament of Lawyers 2 ̆ 7 as a starting point, we propose to fill this void in the literature. Marching through a wide array of empirical evidence covering the last twenty to thirty years, our findings corroborate some of the core theoretical insights of 2 ̆ 7 Tournament of Lawyers 2 ̆ 7. For example, the continuous upward growth of the partnership based on the tournament is clearly evidenced by a 2 ̆ 7 smooth 2 ̆ <b>7</b> <b>upward</b> trajectory in the partnership ranks while associate hiring hews more closely to the underlying business cycle. On the other hand, the widening ranks of permanent 2 ̆ 7 off track 2 ̆ 7 attorneys and non-equity partners, including the prevalence of de-equitizations, suggest the emergence of a more complex and elongated tournament structure that applies to both partners and associates. Under a new model, which we dub the 2 ̆ 7 elastic tournament, 2 ̆ 7 the equity core is primarily reserved for partners who control access to key clients. This structure reduces cross-subsidies between lawyers with differential value to the firm, thus reducing the potential for large-scale lateral defections. Yet, this reduced sharing of risks and benefits simultaneously creates an environment in which it becomes more costly - at the individual lawyer level - to faithfully adhere to professional and ethics principles that are in tension with client objectives. Arguably, these dynamics have made zealous advocacy the touchstone of ethical lawyering. The diminution in sharing also reduces the time horizons of individual lawyers and decreases their willingness to invest in firmwide initiatives that do not simultaneously optimize their own practice. Amidst this widening collective action problem, the 2 ̆ 7 firm 2 ̆ 7 itself has remarkably little autonomy to pursue non-economic objectives, such as racial and gender diversity (particularly efforts directed at retention) or the training and mentoring of the next generation of lawyers. Further, except in some exceptional cases, the influence of firm culture, which may have moderated lawyer self-interest in an earlier era, is weakened by the sheer size and geographic dispersion of the modern big law firm. Although this model is fundamentally 2 ̆ 7 stable 2 ̆ 7 in the economic sense, it raises several philosophical and practical issues regarding lawyer independence and the long-term viability of professional self-regulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{main object}} of the present {{investigations}} was to work out on the problems {{in relation to the}} culture and the propagation of the carp. From this point of view a detailed study of the spawning behaviour, embryology, larval growth, digestive system, and other organs of the carp reared in the experimental pond of Fisheries Laboratory, Kyushu University, was {{made on the basis of}} microscopic preparations. The following distinctive remarks would be noteworthy. 1. The carp spawns on vegetations or like substances at an optimum water temperature of 22 - 24 ℃ for nearly 6 hours at any time of the day, but usually at dawn from April to July at short and irregular intervals. During the spawning act the male nudges the female from behind and approximates the genital part, lying almost parallel to her side. Both lash the caudal region forcibly, discharging simultaneously the ova and milt, and then separate after swimming together for about 30 - 50 cm. The total number of eggs in a spawning female, 590 mm in total length and 4. 9 kg in weight, is nearly 765, 000, which is a considerably a high number for the production of fry. 2. In the embryonic and the larval stages, the blood vessels form a network on the yolk sac and fin folds, and are representations of well developed respiratory devices as an adaptation to less favourable conditions. Large secretory cells are marked around the head and the yolk sac of the embryo and the larvae, and last till the yolk absorption. These seem to aid the larvae in sticking to the substratum, which is a natural device of safety against driftng by the current of stagnant water. The first sign of the rudiment of the gut is marked as an endodermal thickening by about 40 hours after fertlization, which assumes a cylindrical form of double layered cells by 70 hours (18 hours before hatching). By 78 hours after hatching a lumen is formed by the retreat of cells rather than the evagination as in other vertebrates (Fig. 5 P, R, S, T). The mouth is formed at about 8 - 10 hours before hatching (Fig. 5 U, V). The liver is formed on the latero-ventral sides of the gut (Fig. 5 T). Pharyngeal folds are marked at 41 - 45 hours after fertilization as two dorso-lateral endodermal outgrowths which proceed to meet an inwardly pushed layer of ectoderm to form gill slits by 56 - 57 hours after fertilzation (Fig. 5 Q). Pectoral fins begin their formation at about 55 hours after fertilization and the median fin fold is prominently visible by 70 hours. 3. The period of incubation varies with the temperature (Table 2) and at 13 - 17 ℃ the larvae hatch in 90 hours after incubation and measure 3. 9 - 5. 6 mm. Hatching is completed wthin 2. 5 - 3. 5 days. The yolk sac is completely absorbed in 8 mm. All the fins are marked in 10 mm. The posterior end of the notochord is begining to turn <b>upward</b> in <b>7.</b> 5 - 7. 7 mm larvae. The heterocercal caudal fin starts its formation at 7. 5 - 7. 7 mm. Hypurals number 7 (Fig. 10). Scales first appear behind the opercle at 17 - 18 mm, and cover the entire body surface of the carp by 24 - 30 mm. Young carp of this length resembles the adult in appearance (Figs. 6, 13). Liver cells start arranging themselves into lobular forms in 4. 2 mm larva within 10 hours after hatching. The pancreas is differentiated along the left dorsal side of the intestine as a deeply stained mass of cells among the liver cells by 5. 3 mm larva. The gall bladder is marked at this stage (Fig. 7 F, H). The hepato-pancreas assumes the young form by 9. 6 - 10. 5 mm. The anlage of the air bladder is marked a few hours before hatching (Fig. 5 W) and becomes to be filled with air by 6 mm (Fig. 7 C) and pushes the first part of intestine. The anterior one is formed in about 10 mm larva. The newly hatched larva begins its active life after the absorption of yolk (i. e., 7 - 8 mm larva). Active preying habit on the zooplankton is quite prominent by this stage. Schooling behaviour, though, beginning at 9. 5 mm, at this stage or even after is not so significant. They start feeding 24 - 36 hours after hatching. The juvenile and the young prefer to eat at short intervals, which seems to be advantageous for the absence of stomach. The power of discriminating eatable substances appears to be intense. Weberian ossicles are marked by 10. 6 mm joining the ear bones anteriorly and the air bladder posteriorly. The longitudinal grooves and fenestrations are formed by 17 - 18 mm (Fig. 11). 4. The club cells appear at about 12 mm larva on the head skin between the upper lip and the nasal cavity and occasionally multinucleate giant cells are marked more along the dorsal side of the head than the ventral one (Fig. 16 E). By 6 mm the dorsal skin of the head shows wrinkles which are the cytoplasmic extensions of the cells. They seem to disappear at 12 - 13 mm, which is the time of the appearance of club cells at that position. Taste buds first appear on the head skin (between the upper lip and the nasal cavity) at 18 mm. Occasionally, promucous cells like those of the buccal epithelium are observed from the head skin epithelium. A girdle of elongated cells intercepted by collagenous fibres hanging down into the dermis from the basement membrane is observed: this has not been reportd before (Fig. 16 F, G). Mandibular barbels first appear at 18. 5 mm in total length and measure about 217 μ, while the maxlilary ones are noticed at 22 mm which is the stage of the appearance of the taste buds on the barbels. Mucous cells and club cells are evidenced abundantly in the proximal or post-proximal regions of the barbels. The epidermis enveloping the anterior side of the nasal flaps is thicker than that of the posterior one. Taste buds are marked from the distal anterior end. Club cells are absent from the middle and the distal region of the flaps (Fig. 19 A-D). The outer epidermis of the operculum appears to be thicker than the inner one and a few taste buds are noted from the outer side only. Conjunctiva of the eye and the caudal fin also possess taste organs in their epidermis (Fig. 20 AF). Their presence on all these organs are suggestive of their wide adaptability to environments. 5. Lips of the young and the adult are provided with low ridges and shallow furrows (Fig. 22) which appear to be helpful during the feeding activity from the bottom. Horny type of dentitions resting upon the membranous structure are marked on the inner posterior side of the lips of the larvae, juveniles and the young ones; these may help in holding the food materials (Fig. 27 C, D). The maxillary valve is marked with the opening of the mouth in the embryonic stage. It is a small, almost cresentic membranous structure hanging freely into the buccal cavity behind the upper lip. In 6. 9 - 6. 8 mm larvae the mucosa of the buccal cavity (roof) is marked to enter as a thin Iayer into the proximal of the maxillary valve. Mucous cells are greater and larger on the ventral sides of the valve than the dorsal one. One to 3 typical taste buds born on papillae are recorded only from the ventral surface of the valve, which come in direct touch with food substances (Fig. 27 C, E-G). A few prominent papillary folds marked in the mouth cavity as early as 9 - 10 mm become regularly to be arranged by 15 mm in total length and 3 - 4 longitudinal folds are marked from the centre of the buccal cavity (roof). The roof is concave and the floor is slightly convex so as to fit nicely during the food taking. Papillae on the pharyngeal roof are more abundant than those of the buccal one and they decrease posteriorly; on the Aoor, they reach tiI 1 the fourth gill arch (Fig. 23 A-F). Mucous cells are almost uniformly distributed in the buccal cavity. Promucous cells and club cells are occasionally marked (Fig. 27 M). Three types of taste buds are recognized from the epithelium of the cavity: buds with truncated, protruding, and depressed apices. Besides lymphocytes, vacuoles or oval cells are occasionally found towards the middle or distal ends of the buds (Fig. 29 E-J). Five developmental stages of the mouth are marked (Fig. 21) in this study which are related to the change of feeding habits. Pharyngeal teeth are apparent in 6. 8 mm in total length. In the larvae and the juveniles they are arranged asymmetrically in 3 - 4 rows totalling 7 - 8 on each arch. They are curved, serrated, and backwardly directed, which befits the carnivorous feeding habits. They hold the prey tightly and transfer them to the oesophageal cavity. The flatness on the crowns of teeth on the first and second row become apparent by 28 mm (Fig. 24 F), and furrows are established by 45 - 50 mm in total length. This change of teeth formation is in correlation to the change of food habits from early carnivorous to the omnivorous one. The relative length and the width of the pharyngel arch appears to be greater (i. e., 3 - 4. 26) till about 30 mm in total length after which it nearly becomes on an average of 2. 87 (2. 2 - 3. 46) by 45 - 50 mm. The higher value is a characteristic of the carnivores and the lower one of the herbivores (Fig. 25). The horny pad is biconvex and almost four cornered (Fig. 26 C). In the larval stage it is a soft structure but considerable hardness is felt by 28 mm, this becoming quite apparent by 45 - 50 mm in total length. This appears to be in relation to the development of furrows or grooves on the crowns of the pharyngeal teeth. Hardness of the pad is correlated with more herbivorous habits than carnivorous ones. Well developed taste buds are recognized on the palatal organs and in the tissues of the pharyngeal teeth but the finding of the same in the middle layer of the horny pad seems to be of special significance in the gustatory sensitiveness during the act of feeding (Fig. 26 B, E). Mucous cells are absent from the lips. These cells and the taste buds appear to be related to each other in their distribution in the pharyngeal and oesophageal cavities. The former increases posteriorly and|$|R
