This study explored factors associated with risky sexual behavior (RSB) among unmarried most-at-risk young people in Cambodia. Methods: A two-stage cluster sampling method was used to select 1, 204 boys and 1, 166 girls aged 10 - 24 from 252 hotspots in the capital city and seven provinces. A five-item scale was constructed to measure RSB. All variables were entered simultaneously in multivariate logistic regression models if they were significantly associated with RSB in bivariate analyses. Results: Of total, 37. 7 % of boys and 18. 5 % of girls had sexual intercourse in the past three months; of them, 69. 6 % of boys and 52. 5 % of girls were involved in commercial sex. Only 43. 3 % of boys and 6. 5 % of girls reported always using condom with <b>unpaid</b> <b>regular</b> partners in the past three months. Among sexually active girls, 43. 5 % reported having been pregnant and of them, 42. 4 % reported having induced abortion {{as a result of their}} most recent pregnancy. After adjustment, boys with higher levels of RSB were significantly more likely to live in an urban area, to have completed ≥ 9 years of formal education, and to be not currently living with parents. In contrast, girls with higher levels of RSB were significantly less likely to have completed ≥ 9 years of formal education and to have both parents alive. Both boys and girls with higher levels of RSB were significantly more likely to be in the age group o...|$|E

40|$|Aware of the {{importance}} of provide safety blood, the World Health Organization?s (WHO) aimed to obtain all blood supplies from voluntary <b>unpaid</b> and <b>regular</b> donors by 2020, sharing this idea the district department of health in Bogotá, aims to increase to 25 % the normal volunteer blood donors as a strategy to obtain safety transfusion of the city, to 2016. The principal objective {{of this study is to}} identify intervention strategies to strengthen the culture of voluntary and habitual blood donation for Bogota?s blood banks network, In the frame of the program "Bogotá Humana" 2012 - 2016. A systematic review was performed in two data bases Banque De Donnés en Santé Publique and Virtual Health Library, which includes LILACS, IBECS, MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library and SciELO. With the advice of experts two additional tools were developed to support the strengthening of the culture of regular and voluntary blood donation in Bogota. 26 studies were reviewed, and three main strategies were identified: motivational interventions, incentive interventions, remainders and knowledge interventions. The results suggest that combined interventions may improve intensions of blood donations in first and repetitive blood donors. This document develops the first stage of diagnosis and design of the interinstitutional project, the next step is the implementation of the strategies suggested in line with policy willingness...|$|R

To answer this question, I compared the accounts of 22 micro-finance agency employees in the UK and in Belgium with those of 20 self-employed women who received support from these agencies. The results suggest that there are major differences between what most agency employees imagine being problems for women in self-employment (e. g. lack of confidence, lack of training), and what women actually ex- perience (e. g. competitive markets pressures, low-profit sectors, insufficient <b>regular</b> <b>unpaid</b> helpers in their businesses). The data collected among these 20 women has also revealed that most self-employed women earn low or no income in self-employment, and wage employment would represent a better alternative to meet their needs. My thesis is that the individual’s quest for self-fulfilment at work and the current political argument for the increase of economic growth through micro-businesses have favoured the idealisation of both self-employment and micro- finance for women.

40|$|Economic theory {{explains}} {{the supply of}} volunteering alternatively as an ordinary consumer good or an investment good. This paper provides a simultaneous approach, considering both objectives, by using the psychological distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, in order to reconcile conflicting results reported in the literature. Following the simultaneity approach, the paper develops a theoretical model of unpaid labour supply within an agent's two-period utility maximization problem, {{taking into account the}} role of psychological motivation. The theoretical hypotheses are tested with a sample selection model for Italy, by using the 1997 Multipurpose Households Survey on everyday life issues carried out by the Italian National Statistical Office. A robustness analysis and endogeneity test for intrinsic motivation are also performed. Empirical analysis rejects the hypothesis that only a consumption or investment motive can explain Italian volunteers’ behaviour, supporting the hypothesis that both motives interact in shaping <b>regular</b> <b>unpaid</b> labour supply, with a stronger impact of consumption motives. The relevant variables for frequently supplied unpaid labour are intrinsic motivation, age, household income, family responsibilities and activity sector...|$|R
40|$|Over a {{transition}} period of approximately 10 years, the transfusion service {{has moved from}} {{a situation in which}} donors were paid a fee for each visit to the blood bank to that of <b>regular,</b> <b>unpaid</b> contributions. This study set out to measure two important aspects of this change to a non-remunerated system of blood donations:  any fall in the number of eligible donors and changes in the incidence of serological markers.   This was carried out by an analysis of the data from two studies. i)   A retrospective analysis of 10 years of data returns (1990 - 1999) from the blood donation programme, which seeks to make comparisons between paid and unpaid donors in terms of the incidence of positive serological markers. ii)   A prospective study to obtain and evaluate community knowledge about blood donation {{in all parts of the}} United Arab Emirates, sampling existing donors and non-donors. An initial survey of 500 subjects, 250 donors and 250 non-donors was carried out at the beginning of the study and then repeated one year later. From both studies the following conclusions were reached. 1)   There is a continuing need to emphasize public awareness by education and blood donation. 2)   There should be a concentration on educated people in the retention of blood donors and the application of the importance of voluntary, non-remunerated donors. 3)   The promotion of participation in the blood transfusion programme by those of a lower level of education should also be encouraged. 4)   Students from varying socio-economic levels are an important target group. 5)   The support given to mobile campaigns throughout the Emirates should be increased. 6) Greater use of the media to reach the population and encourage recruitment and motivation is required. 7)   The establishment of ‘Blood Donor Committees’ in the Universities is necessary to encourage students to become future blood donors. 8)   There should be greater emphasis on the work of Preachers in the mosques and other religious institutions, to discuss blood donation and link to humanitarian practice.
