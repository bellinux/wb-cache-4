40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of {{strapping}} rowers to their sliding seat on performance during 75 m on-water starting trials was investigated. Well-trained rowers performed 75 m maximum-effort starts using an instrumented single scull equipped with a redesigned sliding seat system, both under normal conditions and while strapped to the sliding seat. Strapping rowers to their sliding seat resulted in a 0. 45 s lead after 75 m, corresponding {{to an increase in}} average boat velocity of about 2. 5 %. Corresponding effect sizes were large. No significant changes were observed in general stroke cycle characteristics. No indications of additional boat heaving and pitching <b>under</b> <b>strapped</b> conditions were found. The increase in boat velocity is estimated to correspond to an increase in average mechanical power output during the start of on-water rowing between 5 % and 10 %, which is substantial but smaller than the 12 % increase found in a previous study on ergometer starting. We conclude that, after {{a very short period of}} adaptation to the strapped condition, single-scull starting performance is substantially improved when the rower is strapped to the sliding seat...|$|R

50|$|After {{launching}} {{his musical}} career in 1993 with singing effort on Vais Sex & Religion and subsequent tour, Townsend released the album Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing <b>under</b> the pseudonym <b>Strapping</b> Young Lad, in 1995. His debut solo release was 1996s Punky Brüster - Cooked on Phonics. Townsend formed a band <b>under</b> the <b>Strapping</b> Young Lad name to perform his next album, the industrial metal album City, in 1997. Townsend started a project initially called Biomech, under the Ocean Machine moniker, to release his less metal-influenced music. It was ultimately released {{under his own}} name as 1997s Ocean Machine: Biomech. This was followed by his first charting album, the 1998 album Infinity, which appeared at number 29 in Japan. Strapping Young Lad went on hiatus at this time so that Townsend could focus on his solo music, which had a varying lineup of supporting musicians.

40|$|Without {{relevant}} visual cues, {{the subjective}} visual vertical (SVV) is biased in roll-tilted subjects toward the body axis (Aubert or A-effect). This {{study focused on}} the role of the somatosensory system with respect to the SVV and on whether somesthetic cues act through the estimated body tilt. The body cast technology was used to obtain a diffuse tactile stimulation. An increased A-effect was expected because of a greater underestimation of the body position in the body cast. Sixteen subjects placed in a tilt chair were rolled sideways from 0 degrees to 105 degrees. They were asked to verbally indicate their subjective body position and then to adjust a luminous line to the vertical <b>under</b> <b>strapped</b> and body cast conditions. Results showed a greater A-effect (p <. 001) but an overestimation of the body orientation (p <. 01) in the body cast condition for the higher tilt values (beyond 60 degrees). Since the otolith organs produced the same gravity response in both conditions, errors were due to a change in somesthetic cues. Visual and postural errors were not directly related (no correlation). However, the angular distance between the apparent body position and the SW remained stable, suggesting that the change in somatosensory pattern inputs has a similar impact on the cognitive processes involved in assessing the perception of external space and the sense of self-position...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{differential}} {{model of the}} hysteretic behavior of unsheathed x-braced frames. The model includes all the relevant aspects (perfect or hardening plasticity of diagonal <b>straps</b> <b>under</b> tension, buckling of diagonal <b>straps</b> <b>under</b> compression). The frame is treated as a single-degree-of-freedom system, and the hysteretic model is written as a small system of ordinary differential equations. In spite of this simplified modelling approach, the proposed model captures the key features of hysteretic cycles of x-braced frames (extreme pinching and slackness) {{and can be used}} to obtain the q-factor for simplified seismic design based on the reduction of elastic spectra. The model also allows to couple several x-braced frames to obtain the response of more complex structures such as complete façades. In fact, the agreement with a more sophisticated approach, such as a finite element model of the frame, is excellent, but the computational cost is considerably lower. This point is illustrated by various numerical examples. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author’s final draft...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} {{quantify}} bra shoulder strap pressures, to investigate how bra strap cushions moderated this pressure and increased comfort, and {{to investigate the}} effects of variations in bra shoulder strap configuration on vertical breast motion, breast discomfort, shoulder pressures, and comfort. Methods: Fourteen healthy women (C+ bra cup size) ran on a treadmill wearing a sports bra <b>under</b> five <b>strap</b> conditions (no straps, traditional vertical alignment, crossed-back alignment, and with and without bra <b>strap</b> cushions inserted <b>under</b> the <b>straps).</b> Bra shoulder strap pressure, vertical breast displacement, breast pain, and shoulder comfort were measured during each trial. Results: Maximal pressures from 0. 83 to 2. 67 N·cm- 2 and mean pressures from 0. 52 to 1. 06 N·cm- 2 were recorded during running. The bra strap cushions only reduced maximal shoulder strap pressure in the crossed-back strap orientation. Vertical breast displacement was significantly less in the crossed-back orientation compared with no straps, and breast pain was significantly reduced in both the traditional and crossed-back orientation compared with the no strap condition. No significant between-condition difference was found in shoulder comfort regardless of shoulder strap orientation, although the crossed-back strap orientation resulted in significant increases in shoulder force and mean pressure values compared with the traditional strap orientation. Conclusion: The bra shoulder strap cushion was not effective in decreasing the bra shoulder strap pressure due to design flaws that prevented it from adequately increasing the strap–shoulder contact area. However, modifying shoulder strap orientation from a traditional to a crossed-back configuration could alleviate the common problem of bra shoulder straps slipping off {{the shoulders of the}} wearer, without decreasing the overall efficacy of the sports bra in providing breast support...|$|R

30|$|Only one {{previous}} study has investigated {{the effect of}} altering bra strap orientation and design on both bra strap discomfort and pressure [5]. Vertical and cross-back bra strap orientations were compared with and without {{the addition of a}} small cushioned pad placed <b>under</b> the <b>strap</b> at the apex of the shoulder. Bra strap discomfort was not significantly different in any condition and bra strap pressure was only reduced with the addition of the cushioned pad in the cross-back orientation, which had higher pressures than in the vertical strap orientation, both with and without the cushioned pad. Although the results of this {{previous study}} suggest that bra strap discomfort and pressure cannot be reduced by altering bra strap orientation and design, the study had several limitations. For example, the authors reported that the cushioned pad was not effective in increasing strap width or, in turn, surface area of contact at the shoulder-strap interface as it was found to curl <b>under</b> the <b>strap</b> in the vertical condition [5]. The higher strap pressures in the cross-back orientation may also have been due to tighter straps in this orientation because the bra straps used in the study were commercially available convertible straps, which do not always allow for the greater distance required between the attachment sites of the bra in the cross-back orientation compared to the vertical orientation. It is also conflicting that the cross-back orientation was the most preferred by the 14 participants when it had the same level of discomfort as the vertical orientation and higher strap pressures. The participant number was also low, and the bra sizes, and in turn breast sizes, were at the small end of the spectrum for women with large breast [17 - 20]. It is also recognised that a range of reasons can affect bra strap preference, such as aesthetics and personal preference, which may have resulted in the cross-back orientation being the preferred orientation in the study cohort.|$|R

5000|$|In the {{immediate}} post-World War II era, most downhill ski bindings {{were of the}} [...] "Kandahar" [...] pattern of cable binding. This consisted of a metal cup {{at the front of}} the ski that kept the boot centred, with a leather strap buckled over the toe to hold it down into the cup. A long metal cable or spring ran around the back of the boot, over a flange protruding from the heel. The strap held the boot forward and kept the toe in the cup and <b>under</b> the <b>strap.</b> The system was designed to keep the toe firmly in place while allowing the heel to rise off the ski. This allowed for a smooth cross-country striding motion. For downhill use, the cable was clipped down near the heel to keep the boot in firmer contact with the ski, and allow some level of lateral control.|$|R
