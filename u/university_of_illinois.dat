5|$|Erected at {{the behest}} of the Illinois General Assembly, the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Illinois</b> Observatory became {{important}} in the development of astronomy due, in large part, to pioneering research by Dr. Stebbins, from 1907 to 1922. Joel Stebbins left the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Illinois</b> in 1922 but left behind a legacy of discovery that helped alter the face of modern astronomy. The building served the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Illinois</b> astronomy department from its opening until 1979, when the department moved into a new, larger building to house its growing staff.|$|E
