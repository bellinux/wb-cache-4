25|$|A folding {{version of}} this model was made for paratroops, {{designed}} with a folding stock for lighter weight. The reliability was not improved, and the folding stock proved less suited to close combat than the solid stock which stood <b>up</b> <b>better</b> in a buttstroke. Some 6,000 to 7,500 were made at Nagoya Arsenal and delivered primarily to the Imperial Japanese Navy for its marine paratroops (Rikusentai), but also to Army paratroops—Teishin Shudan—who used them in February 1942, during the Battle of Palembang, on raids against oilfields. Navy paratroops used the weapon in {{the first months of}} 1942 during the Battle of Manado and the Battle of Timor.|$|E
25|$|The {{sturdiness}} and quietness of the LCA proved invaluable during Operation Dragoon, {{the invasion}} of southern France in July 1944. Operation Romeo had LCAs of the RCN disembark the 1er Commando Français de l'Afrique du Nord to disable German artillery atop the cliffs of Cap Nègre. Canadian LCAs also landed the U.S.-Canadian 1st Special Service Force on the difficult, sharp-rocked shores of Île du Levant in a pre-dawn operation to silence batteries there that threatened the main force. The LCA was a strong little craft, in this instance standing <b>up</b> <b>better</b> to the pounding in rough landings than other LC types, especially on these rocky offshore islands, when many LCVPs were lost. Following the landings in southern France, the RN's LSI units remained in the Mediterranean or began moving to the Indian Ocean in anticipation of joining the war against Japan.|$|E

25|$|Though {{of course}} a very wealthy man, the CPR had taken a {{significant}} toll on Stephen's personal portfolio. James Hill had ended <b>up</b> <b>better</b> off than him for having held on to his railroad when Stephen had had to liquidate his share in it to ensure {{the completion of the}} CPR. He also regretted having encouraged his associates to invest in the CPR, knowing that Hill's Manitoba Railway was a better opportunity. He was not bitter towards Hill, in fact quite the opposite, remaining as Hill's staunchest ally throughout the remainder of his career. Stephen remained a director of the CPR until 1893, but thereafter showed only glimpses of interest in the railway. He reduced his holdings and even encouraged others to follow suit. Ironically, the principal source of Stephen's vast wealth stemmed from his investments in Hill's railroads.|$|E
25|$|In {{the pilot}} episode, {{and for the}} first season, Crockett pilots a Chris Craft Stinger 390 X - a 39-foot deep-v {{offshore}} racing boat. According to T. Rafael Cimino, marine director for Miami Vice, a total of five Stinger 390 Xs were used on the show. A white 390 X was selected for the pilot episode as it would show <b>up</b> <b>better</b> for the night scenes. For the other four Stingers, Chris-Craft showed the production crew a colour scheme that included the red - however, since Michael Mann decided that the colour red was to never show up on the show so a blue colour scheme was instead chosen. The Stingers used on the show were not free from Chris-Craft. In fact, the boats had some serious warranty issues. These issues caused the production team to switch to using Wellcraft 38 Scarab KVs {{for the remainder of the}} show. The Scarab 38 KVs were a 28-hued, twin 440-hp boat that sold for $130,000 in 1986.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, Crabtree posted {{his first}} season with greater than 1,000 {{receiving}} yards {{as he continued to}} develop as a player and grow into his role as the number-one target in the 49ers' passing game. Following Colin Kaepernick's ascension to the starting QB position, Crabtree became a greater focal point of the offense, as Kaepernick's ability enabled more down-field passing. Crabtree began to put <b>up</b> <b>better</b> numbers with Kaepernick at the helm. Late in the season, Crabtree showed dominance in games against the New England Patriots and Arizona Cardinals, with 281 receiving yards and 4 touchdown receptions in those two games. Crabtree finished with career highs in targets, receptions, yards and touchdowns. In the post-season, Crabtree had 9 catches for 119 yards and 2 touchdowns in a 49ers victory over the Green Bay Packers, as well as 6 receptions for 57 yards in the NFC Championship win over the Atlanta Falcons. Crabtree had 5 receptions for 109 yards including a touchdown in the Super Bowl XLVII loss to the Baltimore Ravens by a score of 34–31.|$|E

25|$|A Federal Education Grants Act {{was also}} introduced, which opened <b>up</b> <b>better</b> chances of higher {{education}} for low-income children. In addition, labor-protection and anti-trust laws were significantly strengthened, while from 1969 to 1975 alone some 140 laws were passed that entitled various socially disadvantaged groups to tax subsidies. During the mid-Seventies recession, eligibility for short-term unemployment benefits was extended from 6 to 12 months, and to 24 months in some cases. Active Labour Market Policies were substantially expanded, {{with the number of}} people benefiting from such schemes increasing from 1,600 in 1970 to 648,000 by 1975. In addition, the SPD-FDP government gave more priority to raising minimum housing standards. The Law on Nursing Homes and Homes for the Elderly (1974) sought to guarantee minimum standards in an important area of social services, while the Beratungshilfegesetz (Legal Advice Act) of 1980 strengthened the position of the indigent in need of out of court legal advice and representation. The Maternity Leave Act of 1979 permitted mothers in work to take leave of 6 months after the birth of a child, granted a maternity allowance, and safeguarded jobs for 8 months.|$|E
25|$|Despite his age, he was {{actively}} involved in Georgia’s political life. Backed by his tutor and an influential churchman George of Chqondidi, David IV pursued a purposeful policy, taking no unconsidered step. He was determined to bring order to the land, bridle the unsubmissive secular and ecclesiastic feudal lords, centralize the state administration, form {{a new type of}} army that would stand <b>up</b> <b>better</b> to the Seljuk Turkish military organization, and then go over to a methodical offensive with the aim of expelling the Seljuks first from Georgia and then from the whole Caucasus. Between 1089–1100, King David organized small detachments of his loyal troops to restore order and destroy isolated enemy troops. David also supported the establishment and gradual expansion of a well-organized and highly effective spy network, called mstovaris. He began the resettlement of devastated regions and helped to revive major cities. Encouraged by his success, but more importantly the beginning of the Crusades in Palestine, he ceased payment of the annual contribution to the Seljuks {{and put an end to}} their seasonal migration to Georgia. In 1101, King David captured the fortress of Zedazeni, a strategic point in his struggle for Kakheti and Hereti, and within the next three years he liberated most of eastern Georgia.|$|E
500|$|During the American Civil War, American Saddlebreds were {{commonly}} used by the military, and known for their bravery and endurance. Many officers used them as mounts, and included in their numbers are General Lee's Traveller, General Grant's Cincinnati, [...] General Sherman's Lexington, and General Jackson's Little Sorrell. Other generals who used them during the conflict include John Hunt Morgan and Basil W. Duke during his time with Morgan's Raiders. Kentucky Saddlers were used during brutal marches with the latter group, and the historical record suggests that they held <b>up</b> <b>better</b> than horses of other breeds.|$|E

Afterward, Hitchcock agreed it vastly intensified the scene, and nearly doubled Herrmann's salary. The blood in the scene is reputed to have been Bosco chocolate syrup, which shows <b>up</b> <b>better</b> on black-and-white film, and has more realistic density than stage blood. The sound of the knife entering flesh was created by plunging a knife into a casaba melon.|$|E

2500|$|The Colts were an unspectacular but {{well-balanced}} veteran team, led by 37-year-old star quarterback Johnny Unitas.
