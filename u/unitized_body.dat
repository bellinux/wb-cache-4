25|$|The {{modifications}} to the Concord started with a two-door sedan monocoque (<b>unitized)</b> <b>body.</b> To add strength to the platform after the removal of its roof, fourteen steel reinforcements were welded to the undercarriage and a steel targa roll bar was welded to the door pillars for rigidity, as well as additional passenger compartment protection. The front section of the roof (ahead of the targa bar) was a removable lightweight fiberglass hatch, while the rear section of polyvinyl material folded and included a tonneau cover {{for use in the}} down position.|$|E
5000|$|The term unibody or unit body {{is short}} for <b>unitized</b> <b>body,</b> or {{alternatively}} unitary construction design. This engineering approach of a vehicle describes [...] "of a vehicle, a one-piece frame and body structure" [...] Atype of body/frame construction in which {{the body of the}} vehicle, its floor plan and chassis form a single structure. Such a design is generally lighter and more rigid than a vehicle having a separate body and frame.Traditional body-on-frame architectures has shifted to the lighter <b>unitized</b> <b>body</b> structure that is now used on most cars. The last UK mass-produced car with a separate chassis was the Triumph Herald, which was discontinued in 1971.|$|E
50|$|All of Chrysler’s full sized cars, {{except the}} Imperial, {{received}} major makeovers for the 1965 model year. They were {{the work of}} Chief of Design, Elwood Engel, who was hired away from Ford Motor Company a few years earlier. The <b>unitized</b> <b>body</b> and chassis, with longitudinal front torsion bars and rear leaf springs carried over from the prior generation.|$|E

50|$|The Chairiot solo {{features}} a <b>unitized</b> composite <b>body</b> on a steel chassis; {{the rear door}} is also composite, with an integral steel frame. The front suspension is double wishbone with rack-and-pinion steering. The rear suspension is a trailing arm design with a torsion tube independently controlling the rear wheels. It is equipped with four-wheel disc brakes.|$|R

50|$|A velomobile, velomobiel, velo, or bicycle car, is a human-powered vehicle (HPV) {{enclosed}} for aerodynamic {{advantage and}} protection from weather and collisions. They {{are similar to}} recumbent bicycles and tricycles, but with a full fairing (aerodynamic shell). A fairing may be added to a non-faired cycle, or the fairing may {{be an integral part}} of the structure, sometimes called a <b>unitized</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Since {{then more}} cars were {{redesigned}} to the unibody structure, {{which is now}} [...] "considered standard in the industry". By 1960, <b>unitized</b> <b>body</b> design was used by Detroit's Big Three on their compact cars (Ford Falcon, Plymouth Valiant, and Chevrolet Corvair). After Nash merged with Hudson Motors to form American Motors, its Rambler-badged automobiles continued exclusively building variations of the unibody.|$|E
50|$|The 1935 Olympia was Germany's first mass-produced {{car with}} an all-steel <b>unitized</b> <b>body</b> (monocoque). This revolutionary {{technology}} reduced {{the weight of}} the car by 180 kilograms (400 lb.) compared to its predecessor. Production of the unibody design required new production methods and materials. Spot welding, advanced types of steel, and a new production line layout were among the many advances introduced by the Olympia.|$|E
25|$|The Nash Ambassador and Statesman {{continued}} with overhead- valve and L-head sixes respectively. Hudson and Nash cars had different front suspensions. Trunk lids were interchangeable but other body panels, rear window glass, dash panels and braking systems were different. The Hudson Hornet and Wasp, and their Nash counterparts, had improved ride and visibility; also better fuel economy {{owing to the}} lighter <b>unitized</b> Nash <b>body.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{platform}} {{is based on}} a <b>unitized</b> welded steel <b>body</b> (monocoque) with an independent short long arms (SLA) double wishbone front suspension with stabilizer bar and an independent multi-link twist blade rear suspension with stabilizer bar.|$|R
50|$|It is {{simpler to}} {{determine}} the effects of altering a separate chassis than it is {{to determine the}} effects of altering a load-bearing <b>unitized</b> platform <b>body.</b> Coach builders have built models based on SUVs with a separate load-bearing chassis. The weight requirements of these limos do not meet some/most states Department of Motor Vehicle Rules and Regulations. Limousine manufacturers are often challenged to meet safety, exhaust, weight, and other standards with longer vehicles that hold more passengers (weight).|$|R
50|$|For 1955, all senior Hudson and Nash {{automobiles}} {{were based}} on a shared common <b>unitized</b> <b>body</b> shell, but with individual powertrains and separate, non-interchangeable body parts. This mimicked the longtime practice Big Three (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) that allowed for maximum manufacturing economy. Even with the merger forming AMC, the independent automakers held to a total of about four percent of the market and had to innovate to lower their expenses and tooling costs for new models.|$|E
50|$|Instead, the Scarab did {{away with}} the chassis and drive shaft to create a low, flat floor for the interior, using a <b>unitized</b> <b>body</b> {{structure}} and placing a Ford-built V8 engine {{in the rear of}} the vehicle. William B. Stout envisioned his traveling machine to be an office on wheels. To that end, the Scarab's body, styled by John Tjaarda, a well-known Dutch automobile engineer, closely followed the construction of an aluminium aircraft fuselage. The usage of these lighter materials resulted in a vehicle weighing under 3,000 lb.|$|E

50|$|In October 1958, a new Super Snipe was {{introduced}} and first {{presented to the}} public {{at the opening of the}} Paris Salon de l'Automobile. Confusingly, the designation returned to the Super Snipe I, but this time the variants were identified by a series number. The new car was based on the <b>unitized</b> chassis and <b>body</b> of the four-cylinder Humber Hawk, but with a new 2.6 litre, 2,651 cc, six-cylinder overhead-valve engine based on an Armstrong Siddeley design with bore and stroke of 82.55 mm and near-hemispherical combustion chambers producing 112 bhp at 5000 rpm.|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} perimeter-type {{frame was}} abandoned, {{replaced by a}} unit with rails {{laid out in the}} form of an elongated [...] "X." [...] Chevrolet claimed that the new frame offered increased torsional rigidity and allowed for a lower placement of the passenger compartment. This was a transitional step between traditional construction and the later fully <b>unitized</b> body/chassis, the <b>body</b> structure was strengthened in the rocker panels and firewall. However, this frame was not as effective in protecting the interior structure in a side impact crash, as a traditional perimeter frame.|$|R
5000|$|Wheel {{alignment}} adjustments such as caster and camber {{could be}} made by removing plates over the wheel housings. The new isolated transverse suspension system was a substantial departure from the longitudinal torsion bars Chrysler had introduced in 1957 and used on all models since that year, until {{the release of the}} F-bodies. The transverse (side-to-side) bars weren't as geometrically favorable but saved space and weight. [...] In addition, the new front suspension system was touted as giving a [...] "big car ride" [...] as the suspension had a low, or softer, fore and aft compliance which allowed the wheel to move rearward instead of straight up and down when the tire encountered an object, dampening the blow and rolling with the condition of the road. The two parallel torsion bars and an anti-sway bar were mounted forward of the front wheels, integrated into a spring-strut front suspension. These components were attached to a K-shaped structural crossmember. The K-shaped crossmember was isolated from the <b>unitized</b> car <b>body</b> by four rubber mounts. This transverse torsion bar suspension was also incorporated into the M- and J-body cars.The conventional leaf spring rear suspension was also rubber-isolated, so there was no metal-to-metal path through which road noise or vibration can be transmitted to the body; even the steering column was isolated.|$|R
50|$|A {{subframe}} is {{a distinct}} structural frame component, to reinforce or complement a particular section of a vehicle's structure. Typically attached to a unibody or a monocoque, the rigid subframe can handle high chassis forces and can transfer them evenly over a wide area of relatively thin sheet metal of a <b>unitized</b> <b>body</b> shell. Subframes are often found at the front or rear end of cars, and are used to attach the suspension to the vehicle. A subframe may also contain the engine and transmission. It is normally of box steel construction, but may be tubular.|$|E
5000|$|Lunn {{developed}} a groundbreaking {{design for a}} compact-sized SUV. It featured a steel ladder frame welded to a <b>unitized</b> <b>body</b> and included a four-door version. Because AMC lacked the resources to conduct the lengthy durability tests before the late 1983 introduction of the Cherokee XJ, Lunn headed the first American entry to drive the Paris-Dakar rally. The objective of his team was [...] "not to compete but simply to run the brutal desert course" [...] with two new Cherokees and monitor how they would survive the punishing 6200 mi 6,200-mile race course. Lunn's design [...] "became the template for the modern SUV {{and continues to be}} copied by virtually all major global automakers." ...|$|E
50|$|So {{named for}} its {{resemblance}} to a ladder, the ladder frame {{is one of the}} simplest and oldest of all designs. It consists of two symmetrical beams, rails, or channels running the length of the vehicle, and several transverse cross-members connecting them. Originally seen on almost all vehicles, the ladder frame was gradually phased out on cars in favor of perimeter frames and <b>unitized</b> <b>body</b> construction. It is now seen mainly on trucks. This design offers good beam resistance because of its continuous rails from front to rear, but poor resistance to torsion or warping if simple, perpendicular cross-members are used. Also, the vehicle's overall height will be greater due to the floor pan sitting above the frame instead of inside it.|$|E
2500|$|From the beginning, the Jet {{project was}} {{hampered}} by Hudson President A.E. Barit, 63 {{years old in}} 1953, who disregarded the suggestions of the company's stylists and other advisors. For example, Barit insisted that the compact-sized Jet offer full-size car amenities. While designers attempted to form a car that was lower, wider, and proportionally sleeker to the dimensions of a smaller compact car, Barit would not back away from features such as chair high seating for passengers, and a [...] "tall" [...] greenhouse with a ceiling that would allow riders to wear their hats while in the car. Barit also decided that the Jet's rear design would incorporate Oldsmobile-like high rear fender and small round tail light design. The design was further changed to accommodate the personal likes of Chicago, Illinois Hudson dealer Jim Moran, whose dealership became number one sales outlet for Hudson, accounting for about 5% of Hudson's total production. Moran fancied the 1952 Ford's wrap around rear window and roofline, and Barit ordered a similar design for the Jet. The final result was that the Jet's styling closely mimicked the larger 1952-1954 Ford in many respects. The strong <b>unitized</b> Monobuilt <b>bodies</b> for the Jet were produced by the Murray Corporation of Detroit. One {{of the reasons for}} outsourcing the production of bodies [...] "was that Murray agreed to amortize the tooling costs over the production run, reducing the upfront investment" [...] making the Jet possible because Hudson did not have enough resources to pay for the tooling costs.|$|R
5000|$|The 356 {{was created}} by Ferdinand [...] "Ferry" [...] Porsche (son of Ferdinand Porsche, founder of the German company), who founded the Austrian company with his sister, Louise. Like its cousin, the Volkswagen Beetle (which Ferdinand Porsche Sr. had designed), the 356 is a four-cylinder, air-cooled, rear-engine, rear-wheel drive car with <b>unitized</b> pan and <b>body</b> construction. The chassis was a {{completely}} new design as was the 356's body which was designed by Porsche employee Erwin Komenda, while certain mechanical components including the engine case and some suspension components were based on and initially sourced from Volkswagen. Ferry Porsche described the thinking behind {{the development of the}} 356 {{in an interview with the}} editor of Panorama, the PCA magazine, in September 1972. [...] "….I had always driven very speedy cars. I had an Alfa Romeo, also a BMW and others. ….By the end of the war I had a Volkswagen Cabriolet with a supercharged engine and that was the basic idea. I saw that if you had enough power in a small car it is nicer to drive than if you have a big car which is also overpowered. And it is more fun. On this basic idea we started the first Porsche prototype. To make the car lighter, to have an engine with more horsepower…that was the first two seater that we built in Carinthia (Gmünd)". [...] The first 356 was road certified in Austria on June 8, 1948, and was entered in a race in Innsbruck where it won its class. Porsche re-engineered and refined the car with a focus on performance. Fewer and fewer parts were shared between Volkswagen and Porsche as the 1950s progressed. The early 356 automobile bodies produced at Gmünd were handcrafted in aluminum, but when production moved to Zuffenhausen, Germany in 1950, models produced there were steel-bodied. The aluminium bodied cars from that very small company are what are now referred to as [...] "prototypes". Porsche contracted Reutter to build the steel bodies and eventually bought the Reutter company in 1963. The Reutter company retained the seat manufacturing part of the business and changed its name to [...] "Recaro".|$|R
5000|$|For 1969, a major restyle {{brought a}} {{dramatic}} new look to all full sized Chrysler Corporation cars. Called [...] "fuselage design", it featured a pronounced side curvature from the rocker panels {{all the way}} to the roof rails. Plymouth and Dodge models, excluding wagons, shared passenger compartment structures and greenhouses riding on 120” and 122” wheelbases respectively. Similarly, Chrysler and Imperial models, excluding T&C wagon, shared slightly longer passenger compartments and greenhouses, riding on 124” and 127” wheelbases respectively (all of the Imperial’s longer wheelbase was in the front clip). As in the prior generation, all Chrysler Corp. full sized wagons shared a common greenhouse on a <b>unitized</b> <b>body</b> and chassis with longitudinal front torsion bars, rear leaf springs and the Dodge’s 122” wheelbase. And, as before, the wagon’s shorter wheelbase was offset by additional rear overhang. 1969 Town and Country wagons were nearly identical to other Chrysler body styles in overall length at just under 225”.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{sketches}} of similar-looking cars were completed by Valentin Brodsky in 1938 and by Vladimir Aryamov in 1940, which revealed a growing tendency towards streamline car {{design in the}} Soviet Union. Aryamov's two-door coupe GAZ-11-80 greatly resembled the later Pobeda. The first Pobeda {{was developed in the}} Soviet Union under chief engineer Andrei A. Liphart. Originally intended to be called [...] "Rodina" [...] (Homeland), the name [...] "Pobeda" [...] (Victory) was a back-up, but was preferred by Joseph Stalin. The name was chosen because the works started in 1943 at Gorky Avto Zavod (GAZ, [...] "Gorky Car Plant"), when victory in World War II began to seem likely, and the car was to be a model for post-war times. The plant was later heavily bombarded, but work was unaffected. Styling was done by [...] "the imaginative and talented Veniamin Samoilov". The GAZ-M20 Pobeda {{was one of the first}} Soviet cars of original design and moreover introduced a new vogue in automobile design; only the front suspension and, partially, the <b>unitized</b> <b>body</b> were influenced by the 1938 Opel Kapitän. It was one of the first cars to introduce ponton styling with slab sides, preceding many Western manufacturers. The M20 was the first Soviet car using entirely domestic body dies; it was designed against wooden bucks, which suffered warping, requiring last-minute tuning by GAZ factory employees. The first prototype was ready on November 6, 1944 (for an anniversary of the October Revolution). The first production model rolled off the assembly line on June 21, 1946. It was also the first Soviet automobile to have turn signals, two electric windshield wipers (rather than mechanical- or vacuum-operated ones), four-wheel hydraulic brakes, an electric heater, and a factory-installed AM radio. The car came to be a symbol of postwar Soviet life and is today a popular collector's item.|$|E
