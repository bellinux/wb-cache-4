It took the approach of simply releasing a number of bicycles to the streets for <b>unrestricted</b> <b>use.</b> While Portland's Yellow Bike Project was successful in terms of publicity, it proved unsustainable due to theft and vandalism of the bicycles. The Yellow Bike Project was eventually terminated, and replaced with the Create A Commuter (CAC) program, which provides free secondhand bicycles to certain preselected low-income and disadvantaged people who need a bicycle {{to get to work}} or attend job training courses, and the 2016 Biketown system.|$|E
