40|$|AbstractAlthough {{there are}} {{widespread}} {{claims that the}} nation's sewer infrastructure is failing, these claims are often undocumented except in the region where the sewer is located. There {{is a need for}} a national inventory to present empirical data that accurately represents the condition of our sewer systems. The benefits of such an inventory include: empirical data to justify increased spending on failing infrastructure; benchmarks of the national sewer infrastructure by region; identification of deterioration mechanisms in sewers; and a means for national dissemination of the data. This paper reports on a collaboration between Oklahoma State University and the National Association of Sewer Service Companies (NASSCO) to develop a <b>unified</b> <b>inventory</b> of sewer pipeline condition data. The paper addresses the need for and significance of a national sewer inventory and the approach to developing it.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel paradigm to spoken language identification. We first propose a universal sound recognizer that transcribes multilingual speech utterances into sound sequences using a <b>unified</b> <b>inventory</b> of sound symbols. The {{units of the}} universal sound recognizer form a sound inventory which acts as the common phone set for the languages of interest. Second, we define the concept of bag-of-sounds, the high-order statistics for the co-occurrence of sound patterns. We then build a bag-of-sounds classifier for language identification {{in a similar way}} that bag-of-words is used for text categorization. In this way, a language identifier is built by sequencing a universal sound recognizer and a bag-of-sounds classifier. The bag-of-sounds paradigm significantly reduces the development cost of adding new language capabilities to an existing language identification system. In this paper, a language identifier was built for five Asian languages to validate the approach. It achieves average 98. 1 % classification accuracy for the speech sessions of 10 -seconds length. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} question of this thesis is: How could spare part inventory management of Cargotec Services be streamlined and unified? The motive behind this thesis was to strengthen Cargotec’s service business by creating common policies and by optimizing the {{tied up capital}} in the stocking network while providing suitable service level. The first target was to examine and describe the existing inventory management process. The second objective was to create guidelines for analyzing front line inventories and for determining inventory assortments at different levels. The final objective was to define how inventory management performance should be measured in future. This thesis {{is a mix of}} action oriented research and case study. The first step of the thesis was to create a theoretical framework which would be the foundation for developing and <b>unifying</b> <b>inventory</b> management policies of Cargotec Services. In this part of the thesis, scientific journals and literature were used as source material. The second part of this thesis is the empirical study. This part was begun by examining inventory management processes of both central and case front line unit. The present processes were defined by observation, interviewing responsible personnel, and examining internal documents. After the current processes were examined and described, the streamlining framework was constructed. The framework was based on the theoretical context, interviews, statistics, and benchmarking. This thesis presents a framework for streamlining inventory management process. The framework consists of different guidelines and instructions. The first guideline is for analyzing local item activity. Locally active items are divided into items that need to be stocked locally and items that should be stocked only centrally. Conversely, locally non-active items should be divided into returnable and non-returnable items. The study provides also guidelines for forming strategic stock in the network and performance measurements for inventory management in future. Besides the inventory management streamlining, Cargotec Services should also measure and develop performance of suppliers, haulers, and warehousing service providers. Cooperation and information sharing between different parties should be enhanced by interaction, communication, and exploitation of the new information system and collaboration tools...|$|R
40|$|Linking {{concepts}} and named entities to knowledge bases {{has become a}} crucial Natural Language Understanding task. In this respect, recent works have shown the key advantage of exploiting textual definitions in various Natural Language Processing applications. However, to date there are no reliable large-scale corpora of sense-annotated textual definitions available to the research community. In this paper we present a large-scale high-quality corpus of disambiguated glosses in multiple languages, comprising sense annotations of both {{concepts and}} named entities from a <b>unified</b> sense <b>inventory.</b> Our approach for the construction and disambiguation of the corpus builds upon {{the structure of a}} large multilingual semantic network and a state-of-the-art disambiguation system; first, we gather complementary information of equivalent definitions across different languages to provide context for disambiguation, and then we combine it with a semantic similarity-based refinement. As a result we obtain a multilingual corpus of textual definitions featuring over 38 million definitions in 263 languages, and we make it freely available at [URL] Experiments on Open Information Extraction and Sense Clustering show how two state-of-the-art approaches improve their performance by integrating our disambiguated corpus into their pipeline.

40|$|Apathy is a {{behavioural}} disturbance occurring {{alone or in}} concomitance with depression in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here we present a validation study for the self-report version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-S), carried out {{in a sample of}} 60 non-demented, non-depressed untreated, drug-naïve, de novo PD patients; 20 patients of the sample (33. 3 %) were classified as apathetic according to current clinical criteria. All enrolled patients completed the AES-S and a neurological and cognitive assessment. Mean AES-S score was 34. 43. AES-S did not show floor or ceiling effect. Cronbach’s alpha was 0. 872. Principal component analysis revealed three factors: the first (34. 4 % of the variance) represented constitutive aspects of the construct of apathy; the second (8. 5 % of the variance) represented a social dimension; the third factor (7. 9 % of the variance) represented a dimension related to insight. With respect to clinical criteria for apathy considered as the gold standard, receiver operating characteristics curve analysis showed that a cut-off of 36 / 37 has the maximum discrimination power. High sensitivity and negative predictive values were obtained with cut-off scores of 33 / 34 or lower; high specificity and positive predictive values were obtained with cut-off scores of 38 / 39 or higher. AES-S score correlated with scores on frontal tasks, but not on Beck Depression <b>Inventory,</b> <b>Unified</b> Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn and Yahr scale. The AES-S is a reliable and valid questionnaire for detecting apathy in PD. For screening purposes a 33 / 34 cut-off score is indicated, but a 38 / 39 cut-off score is necessary when a high specificity is desired...|$|R
40|$|Since Taiwan locates at seismic active region, {{seismic hazard}} {{mitigation}} is always {{one of the}} most important parts in natural hazard mitigation plans. To have effective seismic hazard mitigation plans needs cooperation of experts in many fields. In order to accelerate the progress in seismic loss estimation and hazard mitigation, Haz-Taiwan adopts the methodology from HAZUS, which is developed by the scientists and engineers in the United States. However, Taiwan has its special construction environment and quality, seismic design codes, social and economic activities, etc., not only the inventory data but also the analytical models and the associated parameters need to be collected and calibrated. This joint project investigates methodology of seismic hazard analysis and structural damage assessment from earthquake engineering viewpoint. The main objective is to provide technical support, to develop analytical models, and to calibrate associated parameters in Haz-Taiwan program. The research topics include estimation of ground motion intensities due to scenario earthquakes, estimation of permanent ground deformation due to soil-liquefaction, evaluation of site-dependent seismic demand of buildings, evaluation of capacity and fragility curves in damage assessment of reinforced concrete buildings and multi-span continuous bridges, and so on. INTRODUTION The aim of Haz-Taiwan program is to provide a systematic approach, a <b>unified</b> <b>inventory</b> data classification system, and the state-of-the-art seismic scenario simulation technologies to simulate seismic hazard and to estimate structural damages and socio-economical losses.

Escuela de Química, 2012 Costa Rica Institute of Technological {{has several}} {{laboratories}} focused {{on research and}} teaching work, they have various interactions with the environment. Among the most important are those associated with the handling of chemicals and their wastes, due to the various risks for to humans and the environment. Moreover, {{in the last two}} years the Institution spent an average of ninety thousand dollars in the purchase of chemicals, which in turn implies a monetary impact on the institution. The organizing and tracking of these substances, is the first step for an optimal control of the mentioned problems; however, a diagnosis made at the laboratories of the institution (2009), showed that they do not have a technological application to solve the problem, this has imply several specific operational and environmental problems, such as the accumulation of hazardous wastes. The fundamentals of Environmental Engineering are aimed primarily at providing scientific and technological solutions in the field of prevention of environmental problems. For that reason, an online Inventory Management System was designed and validated using modern technologies, also compatible with the platform of the Institution, integrating staff involved in all stages of development, promoting teamwork and encouraging acceptance of the system. The implementation and validation of the project allowed us to have a <b>unified</b> <b>inventory</b> system for all involved in the issue, which guarantees the security of information and efficient access. This system meets the requirements set by future users, improving the efficiency of their work, while allowing them to comply with environmental legislation associated. This allows the Institute to fulfill their responsibilities with the country, besides the institutional legal framework. At the end of the development process, training was provided to 15 prospective users of the system, increasing its sensitivity to the problems described, as well as its relations with the Institutional Regency of Chemicals, the future system administrator.

40|$|The {{first volume}} of these studies {{concentrated}} on the needs, behaviour and wants of New Zealand mountain recreationists. It was the conception of Dr Robert Aukerman of Colorado State University in his leadership of this mountain recreation research programme at Lincoln College that an inventory and analysis of public mountain land resources for recreation should {{be an integral part}} of the programme. Bruce Geden and Jenny Davison had begun such work as part of their post-graduate Diploma in Natural Resources projects at Lincoln College. Under Bob Aukerman's guidance, first Bruce Geden then Jaquetta Smith developed and <b>unified</b> the <b>inventory</b> to include all pub public land areas "perceived as mountains" throughout the main islands of New Zealand. Jaquetta Smith and Jenny Davison patiently canvassed the agencies administering such lands, identifying from a variety of sources the records of natural resources and recreation facilities for each administrative region. The variety of talents that each brought to the study, Jaquetta Smith with degrees in geology and forestry, Jenny Davison in history, Bruce Geden in geography, were unified in their common interest in natural resources and recreation. Their combined work is presented in a format which takes account of both public administration and regional geography. This inventory is of mountain land which is conventionally considered as public land. Omitted from it are the extensive areas of mountain lands which are included in the pastorally-occupied areas of both North and South Island. The recreational use of South Island pastoral runs is the subject of studies reported in the third volume of this series. Recreational use of North Island pastoral properties may be principally as access to public mountain land resources beyond their boundaries. Such questions of access are briefly mentioned at appropriate points in this inventory. Also omitted from this inventory are most of those areas of mountain lands which remain as Maori Land. It would be presumptuous of this Institute to report on such terrain without the active cooperation of Maori people. The recreational significance of such Maori Land to both Maori and other people warrants a full exposition in its own right. This volume will be welcomed as the first compendium of public recreational land resources on a national basis. What is presented here may stimulate other appropriate agencies to compile similar inventories of recreational resources of New Zealand coasts and wetlands and to expand the recreational assessment of New Zealand water bodies. Only by such documentation are the issues of access and management likely to be clarified. The interests of both New Zealand residents and visitors from overseas demand that these issues receive the purposeful and sustained attention of citizens and administrative agencies alike. It is the hope of this Institute that these three volumes of studies will help make this possible...|$|R
