The soy cotyledon storage proteins, important for human nutrition, can be extracted most efficiently by water, water plus dilute alkali (pH 7-9), or aqueous solutions of sodium chloride (0.5-2 M) from dehulled and defatted soybeans that have undergone only a minimal heat treatment so the protein is close to being native or <b>undenatured.</b> Soybeans are processed into three kinds of modern protein-rich products: soy flour, soy concentrate, and soy isolate.|$|E
50|$|Soy {{protein is}} {{generally}} regarded as being concentrated in protein bodies, which are estimated to contain at least 60-70% of the total soybean protein. Upon germination of the soybean, the protein will be digested, and the released amino acids will be transported to locations of seedling growth. Soybeans contain a small but newly very significant 2S Albumin storage protein. Legume proteins, such as soy and pulses, belong to the globulin family of seed storage proteins called legumin and vicilins, {{or in the case}} of soybeans, glycinin and beta-conglycinin. Soybeans also contain biologically active or metabolic proteins, such as enzymes, trypsin inhibitors, hemagglutinins, and cysteine proteases very similar to papain. The soy cotyledon storage proteins, important for human nutrition, can be extracted most efficiently by water, water plus dilute alkali (pH 7-9), or aqueous solutions of sodium chloride (0.5-2 M ≈ 30-120 g/l) from dehulled and defatted soybeans that have undergone only a minimal heat treatment so the protein is close to being native or <b>undenatured.</b>|$|E
40|$|As {{sections}} of a strand duplexed DNA denature {{when exposed to}} high temperature, the excess linking number is {{taken up by the}} <b>undenatured</b> portions of the molecule. The mechanical energy that arises because of the overwinding of the <b>undenatured</b> sections can, in principle, alter the nature of the thermal denaturation process. Assuming that the strains associated with this overwinding are not relieved, we find that a simple model of strain-altered melting leads to a suppression of the melting transition when the unaltered transition is continuous. When the melting transition is first order in the absence of strain associated with overwinding, the modification is to a third order phase transition. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figures, RevTe...|$|E
30|$|Our data {{demonstrated}} that a substance {{which is probably}} able to interfere on cartilage catabolism, to help the promotion of new cartilage synthesis and to reduce oxidative damage to the joint, like native COLLII partially hydrolyzed, could represent a further new therapeutic possibility to improve hand OA, even in association with other SYSADOAs (Symptomatic slow acting drugs for osteoarthritis). Trentham has specified that several studies have shown significant improvement in symptoms when patients were supplemented with <b>undenatured</b> COLLII, including improved joint mobility and flexibility, reduced joint pain, and, in some patients, complete remission of symptoms. The fact that OA is often characterized by an underlying immune disorder lends itself to likelihood that an immune-enhancing nutrient such as <b>undenatured</b> COLLII could be useful in reducing inflammation and redness symptoms of OA, as well [24]. Bagchi et al. confirm the efficacy of <b>undenatured</b> COLLII in OA and RA in a pilot study in humans [25].

40|$|Recombinant {{versions}} of parvovirus B 19 capsid proteins VP 1 and VP 2 {{are used for}} immunodiagnostic assays for detection of antiviral antibodies. The immune response to B 19 {{is characterized by a}} gradual loss of antibodies directed against linear epitopes of VP 2. A similar occurrence for antibodies raised against VP 1 protein would represent a limitation to serological assays incorporating denatured {{versions of}} either viral antigen. Four detection systems for B 19 Ig detection have been developed, including an IgG enzyme immunoassay (EIA) based on <b>undenatured</b> VP 2, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) based on <b>undenatured</b> VP 1, a Western blot assay incorporating denatured VP 1 and VP 2, and an alternative blot system using denatured VP 1 but <b>undenatured</b> VP 2. Specimens (n= 108) were tested by all four systems and identical results were obtained by EIA, IFA, and alternative blot systems, whereby 75 / 108 (69 %) were B 19 IgG-positive. Twelve B 19 IgG-positive specimens, representing 16 % (12 / 75) of the confirmed positives, did not react to either viral antigens when tested by Western blot. It is concluded that these sera do not react with linear epitopes of VP 1 and VP 2 antigens. Eighty-five different specimens, which had previously been shown to be both B 19 IgM- and IgG-positive by EIA and IFA, were positive by B 19 IgM and IgG Western blot. In the IgG Western blot assay, 69 reacted with both VP 1 and VP 2 and 16 with VP 1 only.

40|$|The {{heteroduplex}} molecules {{formed by}} self-annealing of denatured, singly nicked simian virus 40 (SV 40) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) prepared from closed viral DNA were examined by formamide-protein film electron microscopy {{to test the}} DNA for sequence homogeneity. Sequence inhomogeneity appears in the heteroduplexes as single-strand loops. These result from sequence deletion or from sequence substitution, if regions greater than 50 nucleotides are involved. The <b>undenatured</b> DNA from viruses passaged twice at multiplicities of infection much less than 1 plaque-forming unit (PFU) per cell appeared to be homogeneous in size. The heteroduplexes formed by this DNA indicated that approximately 2 % of the molecules carried deletions, but that substitutions were {{below the level of}} detection. In contrast, <b>undenatured</b> DNA from viruses grown by passaging undiluted lysates seven times or by infection with stock virus at a multiplicity of infection of 5 PFU per cell contained a large frequency of molecules shorter than the full length. The heteroduplex samples indicated that 12 and 7 % of the <b>undenatured</b> material contained base substitutions, and 13 and 11 % contained deletions. The deletions and substitutions appear to occur in separate molecules. Length measurements on heteroduplexes displaying the loop characteristic of substitutions have established that these molecules are from true sequence substitutions, and not from adjacent or overlapping deletions. More than 80 % of the molecules carrying substitutions are shorter than the native SV 40 length. On the average, the substituted sequence is about 20 % of the length of SV 40, but it replaces a sequence about 30 % of the native length. The substituted sequences may be host cell nuclear DNA, possibly arising from integration of SV 40 into the chromosome followed by excision of the SV 40 DNA together with chromosomal DNA...|$|E

Apparently nonlethal damages temporally associated with R× 1 consist of (i) heat and alkali-labile cross-links (which produce <b>undenatured</b> DNA that migrates at 45 S) and (ii) heat-labile bonds. The formation of 45 S material is a linear function of light dose, and the production of this material ceases when R× 2 appears at the higher dye concentration. No tendency to plateau is seen at 0. 25 μg of dye per ml. The nature of the lethal damage of R× 2 could not be determined. Damages that were temporally associated with R× 2 at 8. 5 μg of dye per ml were heat-labile, alkali-stable cross-links (<b>undenatured</b> DNA, 38 to 41 S; alkali-denatured-reneutralized DNA, 85 to 89 S) and some double-stranded breaks.

40|$|Although T {{lymphocyte}} {{responses to}} exogenous antigens are exquisitely specific, {{there is little}} information {{on the nature of}} the antigenic determinant interacting with T cell receptors. Several studies have suggested that antigenic conformation is not important for T cell recognition, and that the primary sequence alone determines the antigenic epitopes (1 - 3). This proposal is based on observations that immune T cells react identically to <b>undenatured</b> and denatured protein antigens, whereas antibodies can discriminate between these two forms of the same antigen. One explanation for these observations is that T cells, unlike B cells, require that antigens be "processed" by macrophage-like stimulator cells before they can be recognized. It is assumed that one feature of antigen processing by macrophages is that larger proteins are degraded to small peptide fragments that represent the moiety recognized by T cells, and that the same fragments are produced from denatured or <b>undenatured</b> proteins. In addition, we previously (4, 5) found that the specific responses to small peptide antigens were determined in large part by the amino acid side chains.

In the present investigation, we conducted a pilot study to examine the efficacy and safety of NEXT-II® in borderline subjects defined as healthy and non-diseased state, but with potential risks in knee joint health. Method: We employed Western Ontario McMaster Index (WOMAC) score and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores to assess the extent of improvement in the knee joints in these volunteers following supplementation of 40 mg NEXT-II® (10 mg as <b>undenatured</b> type II collagen) over a period of 12 weeks.

40|$|Serum (antigen) when heated at a {{temperature}} sufficient to cause definite clouding reacts more intensely {{with a specific}} precipitin than {{a portion of the}} unheated serum or samples heated at lower temperatures. The phenomenon is explained on the basis that coagulated protein in suspension is covered with <b>undenatured</b> antigen and the addition of precipitin causes agglutination of the coagulated protein. Similar phenomena are obtained when bacteria or collodion particles are mixed with diluted serum (antigen) and precipitin added; the particles or bacteria agglutinate and increase the visibility of the reaction. Further, it is shown that collodion particles sensitized with cow serum or crystallized egg albumin and subsequently washed until the washing fluid no longer contains the antigenic substance will agglutinate when small quantities of specific precipitin are added. Bacteria sensitized with cow serum and subsequently washed until cow serum no longer remains in the washing solution agglutinate when cow antiserum at fairly low concentration is added.

40|$|The R factor NR 1 {{consists}} of two components: a resistance transfer factor which harbors the tetracycline resistance genes (RTF-TC) and the r-determinants component which harbors the other drug resistance genes. Using partial denaturation mapping {{it is possible to}} distinguish the RTF-TC region from the r-determinants region of the composite R factor NR 1 DNA which has a contour length of 37 mum and a density of 1. 712 g/ml. The r-determinants region was a relatively <b>undenatured</b> 8. 5 -mum segment of the molecule when the deoxyribonucleic acid was partially denatured at pH 10. 7. An RTF-TC genetic segregant of NR 1 which had lost the r-determinants component had a contour length of 28. 7 mum and a density of 1. 710 g/ml. Characterization of an RTF-TC using partial denaturation mapping at pH 10. 7 confirmed that the relatively <b>undenatured</b> 8. 5 -mum r-determinants segment of the composite R factor had been deleted. Circular, transitioned NR 1 DNA molecules (1. 716 to 1. 718 g/ml), whose contour lengths were consistent with an RTF-TC plus an integral number of tandem copies of r-determinants, were also characterized by denaturation mapping. The relatively <b>undenatured</b> region in these molecules had a length equal to an integral number of copies of r-determinants and was located at the same site in the partially denatured RTF-TC as the single copy of r-determinants in the 37 -mum composite NR 1. This indicates that there is a unique integration site for r-determinants in the RTF-TC component. The R factor UCR 122, a TC deletion mutant of NR 1, was also characterized by denaturation mapping. The translocation of the TC resistance gene(s) on the denaturation map permitted the alignment of the denaturation map with the heteroduplex map of Sharp et al. (u 073). Linear and circular monomeric and presumed multimeric r-determinants DNA molecules (p = 1. 718 g/ml) were partially denatured at a higher pH (11. 10). The r-determinants multimers showed a repeating 8. 3 -mum (monomeric) partial denaturation pattern indicating a head-to-tail arrangement of monomers in these poly-r-determinant molecules...|$|E

In addition, either little or considerable quantities of 28 S rRNA as well as 18 S rRNA can also be obtained in virus extracts, depending on the virus stock and growth conditions used to generate virus preparations. Similar RNA species {{have been identified in}} RNA extracted from Tacaribe and Tamiami arenavirus preparations. Oligonucleotide fingerprint analyses have confirmed the host ribosomal origin of the 28 S and 18 S species. Such analyses have also indicated that the Pichinde viral L and S RNA species each contain unique nucleotide sequences. Viral RNA preparations isolated by conventional phenol-sodium dodecyl sulfate extraction often have much of their L and S RNA species in the form of aggregates as visualized by either electron microscopy or oligonucleotide fingerprinting of material recovered from the top of gels (run by using <b>undenatured</b> RNA preparations).

40|$|Heating {{cornstarch}} {{with milk}} {{that has received}} little or no previous heat treatment produces a two-step increase in Amylograph viscosity resulting in higher final viscosity after further heating. The second step disappears as increasing temperatures are used for preheating the milk. Amylograms of 6 % slurries of cornstarch in the preheated milks were compared with gel electrophoresis patterns of the whey proteins remaining <b>undenatured</b> in the same preheated milk samples. As temperature of preheating was increased, smaller portions of each whey protein remained <b>undenatured</b> and the second increase in viscosity shown by the Amylograph became less. After all the whey proteins except (alpha) -lactalbumin and (beta) -lactoglobulin had been completely denatured by preheat treatment at 82 (DEGREES) C, the second step in the viscosity curve no longer appeared but {{was replaced by a}} gradual viscosity increase. This increase was eliminated when the temperature of preheat treatment was raised to 95 (DEGREES) C. Addition of more (alpha) -lactalbumin to milk preheated at 82 (DEGREES) C failed to raise the viscosity, but addition of (beta) -lactoglobulin did increase viscosity. The Amylogram made with the addition of (beta) -lactoglobulin was similar to that obtained with raw milk or milk that had been preheated at only 74 (DEGREES) C. Microscopy and measurement of the swelling power of the starch in the preheated milk samples indicated differences in viscosity were not caused by effects on swelling of the starch granules. Entanglement of protein molecules, especially (beta) -lactoglobulin, with starch molecules inside and outside the swollen granules as denaturation progresses is proposed as an explanation for the viscosity differences...|$|E

Model process cheeses were acidified with lactic acid and treated by addition of <b>undenatured</b> and heat-denatured whey protein, four different emulsifying salts and sodium oxalate. Meltability and toughness of the model cheese increased to a maximum with increased sodium hydroxide conditioning of acid casein to pH 7. 20. These same properties decreased with addition of <b>undenatured</b> and heat-denatured whey protein to both casein cheese models. Loss of emulsion occurred during the meltability test of rennet casein cheese models with 3. 0 and 4. 5 % added whey protein. Emulsifying salts affected the models differently. Disodium phosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate in rennet casein models eliminated the melting property. These same salts in acid casein models produced excellent meltability. Trisodium citrate produced cheeses with good meltability in both acid and rennet casein cheese models. Acid casein cheese models prepared with sodium aluminum phosphate had fair meltability and were very tender (no rupture upon compression). Chelation of calcium by sodium oxalate in rennet casein cheese emulsified with disodium phosphate or tetrasodium pyrophosphate improved meltability with a corresponding increase in toughness. Scanning electron micrographs of model process cheeses indicated a direct relationship between extent of emulsification and poor meltability of rennet and pH conditioned acid casein model cheeses.

40|$|Various {{substances}} {{were isolated}} from rat skin including, protein-dermatan sulfate, certain {{other species of}} heavy and light protein-mucopolysaccharides, five electrophoretically separable nonstructural glycoproteins and a crude and two “purified” variants of structural glycoproteins. When the serum proteins contaminating these substances were removed as completely as possible, none of these produced an accelerated immune response to a rat skin graft in appropriately preimmunized rabbits, and none of those that were tested had a blocking effect on the immune response. On the other hand, the contaminated products and <b>undenatured</b> and denatured rat serum produced accelerated immune responses to a rat skin graft in appropriately preimmunized rabbits. These observations, together with those on skin reactions to the isolated products and to rat serum in rabbits sensitized by rat skin grafts, {{emphasize the importance of}} the included serum proteins in the immune response to this type of xenograft...|$|E
40|$|Recombinant DNA {{methods were}} used to obtain soluble, <b>undenatured</b> {{fragments}} of the heavy chain of myosin subfragment 1 (S- 1). These fragments were of preselected lengths and could include protease-sensitive segments that are destroyed when other preparation methods are used. Actin binding by {{each of the three}} contiguous segments (residues 1 - 248, 249 - 524, and 518 - 722, essentially spanning the entire S- 1 heavy chain) was demonstrated. ATP binding, comparable to that of native S- 1, was obtained only with a segment consisting of residues 1 - 524. Competition among the various fragments for actin was also studied. The data are discussed in relation to the recently reported resolved structure of S- 1 [Rayment, I., Rypnieski, R. W., Schmidt-Bäse, K., Smith, R., Tomchick, D. R., Benning, M. M., Winkelmann, D.
