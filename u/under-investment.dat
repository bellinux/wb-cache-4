It is argued that gentrification in Ostozhenka shares many features observed in the other large cities of the world but, as predicted by theory, is locally embedded. It has been a product of a complex interplay of the market pressure aiming to meet demands from Moscow's successful post–Soviet economy and Moscow government's entrepreneurial and pro–development strategy for the city centre regeneration. The government privileges market forces: it empowers them vis-à-vis the original population and allows them to circumvent conservation institutions, while the achieved profit is shared between the private and public sides.

40|$|Price and yield {{uncertainty}} {{are traditional}} considerations in agricultural markets {{and their impact}} on development. Agricultural producers in transition economies face an additional risk factor – changes in the institutional protection of property rights. This paper illustrates how institutional uncertainty may affect investment, land use, and crop mix patterns. In particular, in the Ukrainian example, the rights of tenants are viewed as uncertain in anticipation of establishment of an open market for sale of agricultural land. Establishment of the land market in Ukraine has been postponed several times over the last 15 years and a significant number of lease contracts are not formalized. A large panel of farm-level data was used to show that a higher share of rented land is associated with a lower share of land used for investment intensive perennial crops controlling for prices and other factors. The difference in response to uncertainty is found to be significant among three crop types: perennials, grains and oil crops. The implication is that the lower level of protection of use rights and uncertainty regarding the future regulation of land sales market lead to <b>under-investments</b> in more capital intensive crops. As a result, tenants deviate from the optimal crop mix, reducing the productivity of tenant farms. Farms under 200 ha are affected most negatively as {{they are less likely to}} be able to access the level of legal and political protection enjoyed by large farms...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} on maritime ports hinterlands {{points out the}} relevance of mass ground transport modes such as barge transport for enormous flows of containers to and from harbours, especially when a maritime port {{is located at the}} mouth of a river. Though, the modal share of container barge transport in French maritime ports (9 % of TEU in Le Havre and 5 % in Marseille in 2007) is significantly lower than elsewhere (32 % in Rotterdam and 33 % in Antwerp). Some reports and studies explain the viscosity of container barge transport flows as a result of several factors, generally concentrated around the seaport community. In continuation of previous seminal works, this paper adopts a neo-institutional approach (Williamson, 1985; 1996) of container barge transport to understand how the factors generating this viscosity are managed. Section 2 describes the characteristics of the transaction of container barge transport. Section 3 is devoted to its attributes (asset specificity, frequency, uncertainty). According to Williamson’s (1996) remediableness criterion, the observed governance structure of a given transaction is presumed efficient and aligned to its attributes. Thus, Section 4 deals with observed governance structures of container barge transport chains with a focus on Le Havre, main French container seaport and shows how agents try to limit opportunism in expost haggling over quasi-rents or <b>under-investments.</b> Implementation of a new institutional environment to modify governance structures is analysed, and a comparison with currently implemented governance structures observed i...|$|R

40|$|Specific supply-chain {{investments}} are vital in achieving faster lead-time performance and more competitive costs. In practice, {{such as in}} the highly leveraged telecom sector, the coordinating original equipment manufacturers (OEM) often delegate the upstream coordination of suppliers to contract manufacturers. This can be justified by informational advantages or economies of scale. However, the rationale of such schemes has also been challenged by analytical work on three-stage chains, leading to open questions. In this paper, we study the organizational and contractual choice of a supply chain coordinator (say an OEM) to either control or delegate the investment decision of some shared resource (say dedicated machines, information or product standards, etc) to a contract manufacturer (CM) or to an upstream supplier in a three-stage supply chain. The analysis derives closed-form results for the economic performance of three scenarios under asymmetric information on investment cost: direct contracting with an integrated CM-supplier, decentralized contracting to tier- 1 suppliers and centralized contracting to tier- 1 and tier- 2 suppliers. The results show that the observed practice to delegate investments to tier- 1 and possibly tier- 2 suppliers leads to relatively poor performance due to <b>under-investments.</b> The superior arrangement is the centralized conditional model, where the OEM forces coordination among upstream suppliers by offering conditional financing.

This situation {{is part of a}} long-term structural problem: decades of <b>under-investments</b> in agricultural sector and poor policies of support for smallholder farmers who form the bulk of the farming population. The inability of these farmers to achieve a supply response when commodity prices were high and market access was less of a problem suggests that there are multiple sets of binding constraints that continue to limit the potential of agricultural growth to reduce food security and poverty on the continent. This article reviews some of the historical trends that have hampered the performance of the agriculture sector. In addition, it reviews the impacts of more positive trends that could stimulate agricultural growth in Africa that could change the African agricultural landscape. The article however warns that there are more recent global developments and some continental challenges that could prevent or slow agricultural growth. These include the global financial crisis, public sector investments, inequities in global agricultural development policies, rush for agricultural lands by foreign investors, domestic commercial financing markets, climate change, and emerging carbon markets. The article argues that while opportunities for accelerated growth exists for African agriculture, new sets of policy instruments will be needed to support smallholder farmers to access new agricultural technologies, finance, reduce impacts of climate change, and adopt sustainable land use practices that can allow them to benefit from emerging global carbon markets.

40|$|What is the {{political}} significance of humanitarian activist engagements with the discarded belongings of migrants? This article explores how bordering practices between states resonate with bordering practices between the human and non-human. It argues that attempts to transform ‘desert/ed trash’ into objects of value are nothing less than struggles over the very category of ‘the human’ itself. Focusing on humanitarian engagements with the objects that migrants leave behind across the Mexico-US Sonoran desert, it explores how the politics of human mobility involves the co-constitution of ‘people’, ‘places’ and ‘things’ in multiple ways. By contrast to a posthumanist analysis that emphasises the agency of material things based on {{a distinction between the}} human and the nonhuman, I draw on the work of Karen Barad in order to develop a ‘more-than-human’ account of the materialdiscursive un/becomings of subjects-objects-environments as more or less ‘human’. This allows for an analysis of ‘the human’ as a political stake that is produced through struggles to de/value people, places and things, and that is thus subject to contestation as well as to processes of de- and re-composition. The article assesses the various ways that humanitarian engagements contest processes of dehumanisation through the re-configuration of ‘desert/ed trash’. Rather than emphasising re-humanisation, however, I highlight the importance of analysis and practice that rejects the lure of ‘naïve humanism’ and the problematic over- and <b>under-investments</b> of migrant and human agency that such an approach involves. This is important, the article concludes, in order that the multiplicity of ways by which ‘the human’ is made, unmade and remade is accounted for without assuming either the supremacy or the powerlessness of people...|$|R
40|$|Infrastructure and {{institutional}} settings for international trade {{play a key}} role in the efficient exchange of merchandise goods across borders. Once final goods depart the producer warehouse, a number of legal procedures associated with customs and security need to be completed at the facilities and service centers located at the borders before the goods can be loaded onto ships for exports. Quantitative measures suggest that ‘trade facilitation’ varies largely across countries; high income economies have state-of-the-art technologies and infrastructures, while developing regions lag far behind with regards to logistics. The goal of this thesis is to explore the extent to which trading capacity inflates transaction costs and reduces competitiveness of goods in international markets with a focus on trade estimations and macroeconomic impacts that are relevant to policy. ^ The first essay establishes the causal effect of trade facilitation on bilateral trade flows within a simultaneous framework using data obtained from 109 countries. A partial equilibrium microeconomic model of trade is derived to underpin the bidirectional relationship between investment incentives and trade volumes. The elasticity of trade with respect to reforms is estimated to be positive and larger than that obtained using the single-equation 2 ̆ 7 s model. The second essay model trade-related capital investments within a general equilibrium framework that extends the scope of the existing literature by fully integrating costs of reforms. The newly-developed model is then applied to estimate the net benefits of infrastructural reforms in Sub-Saharan Africa. Empirical predictions suggest that net benefits from reforms are substantial. However, the opportunity costs of capital investments in terms of foregone present consumptions are steep. The results provide a new perspective on the behavior of persistent <b>under-investments</b> in many developing countries where short run costs are large. The last essay explores prospects of greater regional integration in South Asia from trade facilitation efforts in the region. Impacts on trade, welfare and poverty are substantially positive, that are being used to leverage development efforts at the Asian Development Bank (ADB). ...|$|R
40|$|Deltas are dynamic landforms at the {{boundary}} of land and sea, involving intricate mazes of rivers and small waterways, wetlands, estuaries and coastal barrier islands. They are home to over half a billion people. Deltas are also home to rich ecosystems, such as mangroves and marshes. They are economic hotspots, supporting much of the world’s fisheries, forest products, and extensive agriculture. Yet, delta systems are under threat from sea-level rise, cyclones, river flooding, storm surges, rapid urbanization, agricultural over-use and pollution, salinization, sediment starvation, coastal erosion, and natural and man-made subsidence. One of the missions of the Delta Alliance is to support the development and proliferation of new approaches in delta management through research, exchange of best practices and outreach of concepts and ideas. This report {{provides an overview of}} new approaches emerging in several deltas that can be labelled under the heading of Adaptive Delta Management. Adaptive management can be defined as a structured, iterative process of robust decision making in the face of uncertainty, with an aim to reduce uncertainty over time via system monitoring. Applying adaptive management to deltas is relatively new {{and one of the first}} explicit uses is by the Dutch Delta Program. The Dutch Delta Program formulates Adaptive Delta Management (ADM) as phased decision-making that takes uncertain long-term developments into account explicitly and in with transparency towards society. Adaptive delta management encourages an integrated and flexible approach to land and water management with to aim to reduce vulnerability limit the risk of over- or underinvestment in future challenges such as flood risk management and freshwater supplies. This report shows that ADM is developing rapidly into a fascinating new type of decision making under an uncertain future. The reasons for using the new approach are convincing, the theoretical foundation is growing and the results on the ground are promising. Adaptive Delta Management can be captured as a cyclic process of which the overall design does not differ much from traditional planning steps. However, the approach and methods within each step contain new elements, such as long term scenario building, adaptation pathway developments, signposts and triggers. In this report we distinguish the following building blocks for ADM: Connecting short term investments with long term challenges As part of ADM a planner should create a strategic vision of the future, commit to short-term actions and establish a framework to guide future actions. Typical in ADM is that such a vision has a longer time horizon than usual in planning activities (e. g. a century), in order to capture the long term processes of climate change. So instead of focusing on short-term ‘trial and error’ actions and projects, the idea is to keep the long term vision in mind while prioritizing short-term ‘no regret’ actions. Scenario development is an important tool in this process, against which strategies can be tested to see how robust these strategies are. Path dependency and adaptation pathways The history of deltas shows developments which, once started, cannot easily be changed or adapted to new conditions. This is what we call path dependency: the extent to which a policy action is limited by actions implemented in the past or by actions planned anterior in the pathway. Learning from the past and knowing that we cannot predict the future this leads us to the ambition to avoid Towards a comprehensive framework for adaptive delta management June 2014 Delta Alliance 3 such lock-ins. One way to do this is to use adaptation pathways: i. e. a sequence of policy actions over time that is able to achieve a set of objectives. Avoidance of over- and under investments Insight in the adaptation pathways is not only relevant for the required flexibility of measures, but also in view of the risks of over- or <b>under-investments.</b> Underinvestment occurs if it turns out that the solutions are not adequate. Overinvestment on the other hand happens when measures are over dimensioned, which proved unnecessary and therefore too expensive. Connecting public and private (investment) agendas Another building block for ADM is to actively search for windows of opportunity to combine different investment agendas, either within the public domain or between public and private investments. This way measures may be easier (and cheaper) to implement and yield more added (societal) value. The way forward Three phases can be defined in applying ADM. The first phase focuses on identification of current and future problems and challenges based on relevant future scenarios. In the second phase options are explored which might enhance the sustainability and/or reduce the vulnerability for both current threats and longer term uncertain futures. The last phase focuses on integrating the adaptation options into viable management strategies and ensuring their proper implementation. Until now the first two steps are gaining momentum, although more knowledge is needed on how deltas as complex dynamic systems work. How to link the second and the third step, where financing arrangements, public (infrastructure) procurement strategies, implementation constraints and opportunities as well as durable maintenance arrangements play a decisive role, is yet to be explored. We can potentially learn much by analyses of best practices which take into account the diversity in social and cultural dimensions. These practical experiences can thus generate a larger body of knowledge on delta planning and management...|$|R
