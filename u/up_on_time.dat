5|$|On {{his last}} day, after oversleeping, Homer {{attempts}} {{to do all}} the things on his list. He has a man-to-man talk with Bart, listens to Lisa play her saxophone, and borrows Ned's camcorder to make a video for Maggie that she can look at when she is older. Next, Homer reconciles with his father Grampa, which takes up far more time than he expects and forces him to give up doing some of the things on his list. After trying to catch <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>time</b> he lost doing these things, Homer is arrested for speeding. He calls Barney, who is asked to pay $50 to bail him out. After being acquitted, he tells off his boss Mr. Burns and has one last drink at Moe's Tavern with his friends, causing him to miss dinner with his waiting family. He then hurries home in time to say goodbye to his children and make love to Marge.|$|E
25|$|Luftwaffe tactics were {{influenced}} by their fighters. The Bf 110 proved too vulnerable to the nimble single-engined RAF fighters. This meant the bulk of fighter escort duties fell on the Bf 109. Fighter tactics were then complicated by bomber crews who demanded closer protection. After the hard-fought battles of 15 and 18 August, Göring met with his unit leaders. During this conference, {{the need for the}} fighters to meet <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>time</b> with the bombers was stressed. It was also decided that one bomber Gruppe could only be properly protected by several Gruppen of 109s. In addition, Göring stipulated that as many fighters as possible were to be left free for Freie Jagd ("Free Hunts": a free-roving fighter sweep preceded a raid to try to sweep defenders out of the raid's path). The Ju 87 units, which had suffered heavy casualties, were only to be used under favourable circumstances. In early September, due to increasing complaints from the bomber crews about RAF fighters seemingly able to get through the escort screen, Göring ordered an increase in close escort duties. This decision shackled many of the Bf 109s to the bombers and, although they were more successful at protecting the bomber forces, casualties amongst the fighters mounted primarily because they were forced to fly and manoeuvre at reduced speeds.|$|E
500|$|Megan Fox was {{originally}} {{attached to the}} film, and Patrick Dempsey's role as Dylan Gould {{was to be the}} employer of Fox's character, Mikaela Banes. According to various published sources, Fox's absence from the film was due to Bay ultimately choosing not to renew her role in light of her comparing him and his work ethics to Adolf Hitler, although representatives for the actress said that it was her decision to leave the film franchise. Bay later claimed that Fox was fired by executive producer Steven Spielberg, a claim which Spielberg denied. [...] "I wasn't hurt", Bay stated, [...] "because I know that's just Megan. Megan loves to get a response. And she does it in kind of the wrong way. I'm sorry, Megan. I'm sorry I made you work twelve hours. I'm sorry that I'm making you show <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>time.</b> Movies are not always warm and fuzzy." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} the music video was a joint {{collaboration}} between Gaga and Lawrence. Originally, the video {{was going to be}} shot in New York City, with more elaborate sets, including sets outdoors. The idea was scrapped, however, for budgetary reasons: [...] the budget for the video was low and there was no product placement. Because of Gaga's schedule, the video was shot in Los Angeles over a two-day period. Lawrence described Gaga's work ethic and creativity during the video shoot: [...] "She loves the art form of music videos and she is a real creative partner and has great ideas and really cool and unique tastes. She has a great team working with her as well, helping build really fantastic things that she wears. She works hard, she shows <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>time</b> and she's pretty spontaneous ... it was great ... if she had a new song and wanted to do something, I would do it in a second. She was really fun to work with." ...|$|E

Connie and Sam were again voted 'Best Couple of Series 9', with Tom Chambers' portrayal of Sam during {{the birth of their}} daughter voted fifth 'Best Acting Performance' of the series. Asked to comment on why he thought Sam had proven so popular with viewers, Chambers responded: [...] "No idea! I just try to turn <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>time</b> and learn my lines.

It's a roller-coaster of emotions and storylines - some are not as easy to manage as others and it's always a challenge to find the most natural and interesting way to deliver." ...|$|E

Otis Williams informed the then still-new Edwards that the group would lay him off and rehire Ruffin while in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to previous Led Zeppelin albums, In Through the Out Door features much greater {{influence on the}} part of bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones and vocalist Robert Plant, and relatively less from drummer John Bonham and guitarist Jimmy Page. Two songs from the album—"South Bound Saurez" [...] and [...] "All My Love"—were the only two original Led Zeppelin songs that Jimmy Page had no part in writing. With the exception of [...] "Darlene," [...] a boogie-woogie based song credited to all band members (which was eventually released on the 1982 album, Coda), Bonham did not receive writing credits for any of the songs recorded at Polar Studios. This diminished input by Page and Bonham is attributed to the two band members often not showing <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>time</b> at the recording studio, with Bonham struggling with alcoholism and Page battling heroin addiction. As Jones said, [...] "there were two distinct camps by then, and we [...] were in the relatively clean one." ...|$|E

He was one of 64 Australians to receive the award for their actions during the First World War, receiving it as a result of deeds performed during the Battle of Mont St Quentin on 1 September 1918. That day, Mactier was a battalion runner serving with the 23rd Battalion, Australian Imperial Force. He was sent forward by an officer to determine the cause of a delay in the battalion moving into its jumping off position. The cause was a well placed enemy machine gun. On his own initiative, Mactier jumped out of the trench and charged the gun, killing its crew of six. He then charged two other machine guns, killing more crews and causing at least 40 enemy to surrender. He was killed by fire from a fourth machine gun, but not before enabling his battalion to form <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

His motto was [...] "Work equals work", but Shatner's willingness to take any role, no matter how [...] "forgettable", likely hurt his career.
