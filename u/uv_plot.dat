40|$|We are {{pursuing}} {{a project to}} build a database of phase calibration sources suitable for Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). Here we present the first release of 45 low frequency calibration sources at 235 MHz and 610 MHz. These calibration sources are broadly divided into quasars, radio galaxies and unidentified sources. We provide their flux densities, models for calibration sources, (<b>u,v)</b> <b>plots,</b> final deconvolved restored maps and clean-component lists/files {{for use in the}} Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS) and the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA). We also assign a quality factor to each of the calibration sources. These data products are made available online through the GMRT observatory website. In addition we find that (i) these 45 low frequency calibration sources are uniformly distributed in the sky and future efforts to increase the size of the database should populate the sky further, (ii) spectra of these calibration sources are about equally divided between straight, curved and complex shapes, (iii) quasars tend to exhibit flatter radio spectra as compared to the radio galaxies or the unidentified sources, (iv) quasars are also known to be radio variable and hence possibly show complex spectra more frequently, and (v) radio galaxies tend to have steeper spectra, which are possibly due to the large redshifts of distant galaxies causing the shift of spectrum to lower frequencies.

40|$|Abstract. Seyfert narrow line regions (NLR) have {{emission}} line ratios which are remarkably uniform, displaying only ∼ 0. 5 dex variation between different galaxies. Existing {{models have been}} unable to explain these observations without the introduction of ad hoc assumptions, geometrical restrictions or new parameters. Here we introduce a new model: dusty radiation pressure dominated photoionization, which provides a natural self-regulating characteristic leading to an invariance of the spectrum over a very wide range (> 100) of ionization parameter. The dusty model is able to reproduce both the range and the absolute value of the observational line ratios not only in the standard optical diagnostic diagrams but also in <b>UV</b> diagnostic <b>plots,</b> providing an explanation to the problem in NLR observations. 1...|$|R

30|$|The {{photocatalytic}} {{behaviors of}} the synthesized sample as well as TiO 2 -P 25 were investigated via measuring the degradation of methylene blue as described previously [19]. For this reason, 100  mg of the powder samples {{were added to the}} methylene blue solution (30  mg/L), continuously stirred. The obtained suspensions were irradiated under UV lamp. The decomposition of methylene blue versus irradiation time was recorded by a UV–visible spectrophotometer. For this purpose, variation of the concentration, which is expressed as ln C 0 /C (where C 0 refers to the initial concentration of methylene blue solution and C depicts the concentration of methylene blue after <b>UV</b> irradiation), was <b>plotted</b> versus time of UV exposure (30, 60, 90, and 120  min).|$|R
40|$|Apparatus was {{designed}} and constructed in which a bacterial aerosol of known age, particle size, and relative humidity (RH) could be exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation of measured intensity for a given {{period of time and}} then be sampled quantitatively. Aerosols of Serratia marcescens were exposed to UV dosages between 96. 0 and 0. 75 (μw-sec) /cm 2 at humidities ranging from 25 to 90 %. A sharp decline in the fraction of organisms killed was found at RH values above 60 to 70 %. Above 80 % RH, there was evidence for reactivation induced by <b>UV.</b> The <b>plot</b> of „log fraction organisms remaining” versus UV dose was curvilinear, suggesting noncompliance with the monomolecular law of reaction velocity, but the Bunsen-Roscoe law of reciprocity between time and intensity of UV exposure was demonstrated to hold. These results could be accounted for by postulating the presence in the aerosol of two populations of organisms with different sensitivities to UV, each individually obeying the monomolecular law of reaction velocity. The data amplify existing information on the relationship between UV disinfection of airborne organisms and RH. In the middle range of humidities, the sensitivity of the organisms to UV was greater than would be expected from published reports...|$|R

Polyethylene glycol(PEG), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), and poly N-vinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) {{are used as}} nanoparticle stabilizers. The sizes of Fe nps {{are found to be}} 9 [*]nm, 14 [*]nm, and 17 [*]nm[*]±[*] 1 [*]nm corresponding to PEG, CMC, and PVP stabilizers, respectively. The three different iron nanoparticles (Fe nps) prepared are used as catalysts in the hydrogenation reaction of various substituted aromatic ketones to alcohols with NaBH 4. The progress of the reaction was monitored using time variance <b>UV</b> spectra. Kinetic <b>plots</b> are made from the absorbance values and the pseudo first order rate coefficient values are determined. Catalytic efficiency of the Fe nps is obtained by comparing the pseudo first order rate coefficient values, times of reaction, and % yield. Fe-PEG nps was found to act as better catalyst than Fe-CMC nps and Fe-PVP nps. Also, effects of substituents in the aromatic ring of ketones reveal that +I substituents are better catalysed than –I substituents...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of wireless communication systems and services has caused great demands in designing multiband for mobile communication. Therefore LTE (Long Term Evolution) {{is a new}} high-performance air interface standard for mobile communication systems. It is the last step toward the 4 th generation (4 G) of radio technologies designed to increase the capacity and speed of mobile telephone networks. LTE provides ultra-broadband speeds for complex multimedia applications by using a high performance antenna Since it allows users to access network services wirelessly. In high performance of LTE antenna’s applications where size, weight, cost, performance, ease of installation are constraints, low profile antenna is very much required. To meet these requirements Indoor Multiband Antenna for wireless Mobile Broadband is preferred. This project describes the design of A Monopole Planar antenna operates in five bands: GSM (890 – 960 MHz), DCS (1710 – 1880 MHz) and LTE 2. 7 MHz. applications. By using transmission line feed A Monopole Planar antenna was designed, simulated and, fabricated and measured.

40|$|The {{effect of}} solar UV-B {{radiation}} {{on the population}} dynamics and composition of the culturable bacterial community from peanut (Arachis hypogeae L.) was examined in field studies using plants grown under UV-B−transmitting (UV-B+) or UV-B−excluding (UV-B−) plastic filters. Our data demonstrate that solar UV-B selection alters phyllosphere bacterial community composition and that UV tolerance is a prevalent phenotype late in the season. The total bacterial population size was not affected by either UV-B treatment. However, isolates from the UV-B+ plots (n = 368) were significantly more UV tolerant than those from the UV-B− (n = 363) <b>plots.</b> <b>UV</b> sensitivity was determined as the minimal inhibitory dose of UV that resulted in an inhibition of growth compared {{to the growth of}} a nonirradiated control. The difference in minimal inhibitory doses among bacterial isolates from UV-B+ and UV-B− treatments was mainly partitioned among nonpigmented isolates, with pigmented isolates as a group being characterized as UV tolerant. A large increase in UV tolerance was observed within isolate groups collected late (89 and 96 days after planting) in the season. Identification of 200 late-season isolates indicated that the predominant UV-tolerant members of this group were Bacillus coagulans, Clavibacter michiganensis, and Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens. We selected C. michiganensis as a model UV-tolerant epiphyte to study if cell survival on UV-irradiated peanut leaves was increased relative to UV survival in vitro. The results showed an enhancement in the survival of C. michiganensis G 7. 1, especially following high UV-C doses (300 and 375 J m− 2), that was evident between 24 and 96 h after inoculation. A dramatic increase in the in planta/in vitro survival ratio was observed over the entire 96 -h experiment period for C. michiganensis T 5. 1...|$|R
40|$|We present submillimetre {{continuum}} {{observations of}} the L 1204 /S 140 complex in broad bands centred at 450, 800 and 1100 μ m. The morphology of the region is similar at all three wavelengths, with the emitting region compact, about 90 arcsec in diameter, and centrally peaked around the cloud core. Three new submillimetre continuum sources are observed which are not coincident with any previously known near or mid-infrared sources. We designate the sources S 140 -SMM 1 - 3. SMM 1 is roughly coincident with a previously known NH 3 clump and 2. 7 mm source, and near-IR reflection nebulosity {{from the surface of}} SMM 2 has previously been seen. The three submillimetre continuum sources may be protostellar in nature, although {{it is not possible to}} determine whether they are gravitationally bound, since virial mass estimates are disrupted by the presence of an energetic bipolar outflow. For this reason, earlier claims that the 2. 7 mm source in SMM 1 is collapsing appear somewhat premature. The observation that SMM 1 and SMM 2 lie either side of the infrared sources, in a line roughly perpendicular to the direction of the bipolar outflow, imply they may be the remnants of a large-scale disk. Comparison of the continuum emission with previous high resolution CS, NH 3 and CI observations provides evidence that, for the first time, demonstrates the photon-dominated region and outflow are intimately linked. The only scenario that is able to explain all of the available molecular and atomic emission line data and our submillimetre continuum data, is one in which the outflow has expanded towards the edge of the molecular cloud and the edge of the blueshifted outflow lobe is now bounded by the expanding HII region. The NH 3 and continuum emission emanate from the inner edge of the outflow lobe, shielded from the external <b>UV</b> field. A <b>plot</b> of the 800 μ m flux against N(C 18 O) implies that the dust/gas mass ratio is close to the canonical value (1...|$|R
