5|$|A poll in April 2014 by the Irish Times and Ipsos MRBI {{found that}} 67% would {{vote in favour}} of {{same-sex}} marriage and 21% against, with 12% <b>undecided.</b> When the <b>undecided</b> are excluded, 76% are in favour and 24% against.|$|E
5|$|Coming off {{his fourth}} championship, the 34-year-old Niedermayer {{contemplated}} retirement. Remaining <b>undecided</b> on his future as the 2007–08 season began, {{he failed to}} report to the team and was suspended by the Ducks as a formality. Pronger replaced him as captain, and Niedermayer remained <b>undecided</b> until early December when he finally chose to return. He appeared in only 48 games that season, scoring 25 points, but played in his fourth All-Star Game.|$|E
5|$|As the {{campaign}} entered its final week, polls showed Specter and Sestak {{at a dead}} heat, with different surveys reporting contradictory findings over which candidate maintained a slight edge. A Quinnipiac University poll found Specter leading 44-42 percent, with fourteen percent <b>undecided,</b> whereas a Franklin & Marshall poll found Sestak ahead 38-36 percent, with {{about a quarter of}} voters <b>undecided.</b> In both cases, the lead fell within the survey's margin of error. G. Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin & Marshall poll, said that Sestak improved because his television commercials were resonating with voters on three fronts: the arguments that Specter switched parties for solely political reasons, that he consistently voted for Republican policies and that he had been in office too long.|$|E
5|$|In a November 2016 interview, Perry {{admitted}} he was <b>undecided</b> about the Daddies' third volume of cover songs, yet had narrowed the choice down {{to either a}} western swing album or a Babs Gonzales/"beatnik"-style bebop album.|$|E
5|$|The first {{opinion poll}} {{conducted}} after {{the allegations against}} Comer showed Bevin leading the race with 27% support to Heiner's 26%, Comer's 25%, and Scott's 8%, with 14% still <b>undecided.</b>|$|E
5|$|A poll in November 2013 (by RED C for Paddy Power) {{showed that}} 76% of voters {{intended}} {{to support the}} introduction of same-sex marriage in any referendum, with 18% opposed and 6% <b>undecided</b> (with the undecideds excluded the ratio is 81% support, 19% against). Support was highest among women (85%), those under 44 (87%), Labour supporters (96%) and those living in Dublin and commuter counties (83%).|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{was still}} <b>undecided</b> on his future. He had offers from several European universities, {{including}} Christ Church, Oxford where he stayed for three short periods between May 1931 and June 1933 and {{was offered a}} 5-year studentship, but in 1935 {{he arrived at the}} decision to remain permanently in the United States and apply for citizenship.|$|E
5|$|In early March 2013, {{following}} {{the withdrawal of}} incumbent mayor Luke Ravenstahl, a poll conducted by Keystone Analytics found that Bill Peduto was leading the race, garnering the support of 30 percent of respondents. Jack Wagner was second with 20 percent of respondents voicing support. Nearly a quarter of respondents, 22 percent, remained <b>undecided.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the Don't Ask, Don't Tell {{policy was}} lifted September 20, 2011, the academy began admitting and {{retaining}} openly gay cadets. By March 2012, cadets were forming a gay-straight alliance group called Spectrum. By March 2015, Spectrum had two faculty and 40 cadet members, {{a mixture of}} gay, straight, bi, and <b>undecided.</b> According to a Vanity Fair essay, the LGBT cadets were well accepted. After the ban on transgender service members was lifted in 2016, the Class of 2017 saw the first openly transgender graduate. However, she was denied a commission and was honorably discharged.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} miners {{were able to}} reach a {{settlement}} in early 1990, the case of the UMWA vs. Pittston Coal Company did not end in 1990. The fines, over $60 million, did not come into bargaining until 1994 and Pittston agreed to drop most of the charges. However, since the case was now in the court system, many courts wanted the UMWA to be responsible for all of the fines. The UMWA appealed all fines against them and the case remained <b>undecided</b> for many years.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of his}} career, Peart {{had never}} {{publicly}} identified with any political party or organization in Canada or the United States. Even so, his political and philosophical views have often been analyzed through his work with Rush and through other sources. In October 1993, shortly before that year's Canadian federal election, Peart appeared with then-Liberal Party leader Jean Chrétien in an interview broadcast in Canada on MuchMusic. In that interview, Peart stated he was an <b>undecided</b> voter who supported Quebec federalism.|$|E
5|$|Girl Pat left Grimsby on 1 April 1936. According to Stone's later account, {{when they}} entered the open sea, Orsborne {{assembled}} the crew—except for Jefferson—in the wheelhouse {{and told them that}} this would not be a normal fishing trip. Instead, he proposed to take the boat south, first calling at Dover where he would get rid of Jefferson, who was not included in his further plans. At this stage Orsborne was apparently <b>undecided</b> as to his longer-term intentions, but indicated that they would be sailing into southern waters and might go fishing for pearls.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, a CBS News / New York Times poll {{reported}} that 47% of Americans approved {{the health care}} law. This {{was the first time}} that a major poll indicated that more respondents approved ACA than disapproved of it. The recurring Kaiser Health Tracking Poll from December 2016 {{reported that}}: a) 30% wanted to expand what the law does; b) 26% wanted to repeal the entire law; c) 19% wanted to move forward with implementing the law as it is; and d) 17% wanted to scale back what the law does, with the remainder <b>undecided.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the December 8 American Research Group survey, {{excluding}} <b>undecided</b> voters, Hunter {{was statistically}} tied with Fred Thompson for fourth place in Nevada. In Michigan, Hunter {{was tied with}} Thompson and Ron Paul for fifth place at four percent, according to a WXYZ-TV poll. Los Angeles Times columnist Don Frederick pointed out that Hunter's support in the polls came almost entirely from Republican men, where he garnered 6% among that demographic in the publication's poll from December 2007. Among women, his support was nearly zero.|$|E
5|$|Polling firm Public Policy Polling {{conducted}} {{a poll of}} Giron's district between September 7 and 9, asking likely voters if they supported the recall of Giron, whether they supported various components of the gun control bill, whether they approved of the NRA and Governor Hickenlooper, and who {{they would vote for}} in a hypothetical 2014 gubernatorial election between Hickenlooper and Republican Tom Tancredo, as well as various methodological questions. The results found voters supported recalling Giron by 54% to 42%, with 4% <b>undecided.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 1920 Akron Pros {{had one of}} {{only two}} African American players in the AFPA, Fritz Pollard. He later went on to be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame's class of 2005. Even though the Pros were given the trophy in 1920, the league lost track of the event {{and for a long time}} {{published}} in its own record books that the 1920 championship was <b>undecided.</b> It was not until the 1970s that the NFL remembered its early vote on awarding the Akron Pros the championship.|$|E
5|$|The Office of Housing and Residential Life {{also offers}} {{optional}} {{communities in the}} residence halls. These communities include the Architecture and Arts Community, for students majoring in Architecture or art-related majors, Honors Place for Honors College students, F.Y.R.S.T. (First Year Residents Succeeding Together) for all freshmen in any major, F.Y.R.S.T. Explore, for <b>undecided</b> freshmen, Leader's in Residence for students interested in civic service and leadership opportunities and the Law Community for College of Law students.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{initially}} hinted {{as a new}} anime project collaboration with Bandai Visuals and Production I.G. The film was officially announced by Production I.G at the 2006 Tokyo Anime Fair. Whether the film would be released theatrically, broadcast on television, or released direct-to-DVD was <b>undecided</b> at the time. The film had a production budget of 360 million yen (equivalent to US$4.3 million). It was produced in Hi-vision format and {{was made by the}} same staff that originally made the TV series.|$|E
5|$|The thirteenth {{and final}} {{season of the}} Australian police drama Blue Heelers premiered on the Seven Network on 1 April 2006 and aired on Saturday nights at 8:30 pm. The 11-episode season {{concluded}} 4 June 2006, due to its cancellation by the Seven Network {{as a result of}} its sharp decline in ratings. When, in late 2005, the time came to renew Blue Heelers, Seven commissioned eleven further episodes to be produced, but its future after this was still <b>undecided.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a variety of campaigns in other states to select a state dog. Georgia was <b>undecided</b> over {{choosing}} a state dog in 1991, with {{an attempt to make}} the Golden Retriever the official dog failing after a vote in the Georgia State Senate; an opposing campaign promoted the Bulldog, the mascot of the University of Georgia. The campaign to make the Siberian Husky the Washington state dog failed in the Washington House of Representatives in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Totti {{intended}} {{to retire from}} international football after the 2006 World Cup, but reneged on his decision and remained <b>undecided</b> on his future for over a year, not being called up in the meantime. He made his retirement official on 20 July 2007, {{at the beginning of}} the 2007–08 Serie A season, due to recurring physical problems and in order to focus solely on club play with Roma. Italy's coach at the time, Roberto Donadoni, attempted to get Totti to change his mind for the remaining Euro 2008 qualifiers but was not successful.|$|E
5|$|When Germany {{invaded the}} Soviet Union, on 22 June 1941, {{it came to}} be seen as {{unlikely}} that there would be any attempted landing as long as that conflict was <b>undecided</b> — from the British point of view at the time, the matter hung in the balance. In July 1941, construction of field fortifications was greatly reduced and concentration given to the possibility of a raid in force rather than a full-scale invasion.|$|E
5|$|While {{the outcome}} of the battle was still <b>undecided,</b> a second British frigate——arrived. Outnumbered, the French captain saw no {{alternative}} and surrendered his ship. The late arrival of Arethusa—under Captain Robert Mends, who claimed the victory for himself—sparked a furious argument that developed into a lasting animosity between Mends and Captain Michael Seymour of Amethyst. The failure of Niémen to reach Isle de France also had serious repercussions for the French squadron there. With naval supplies severely limited, their ability to operate at sea {{for long periods of time}} was hampered and by late 1810 few of their vessels were still seaworthy.|$|E
5|$|An EKOS poll {{conducted}} in December 2009 revealed that 83% {{of the respondents}} believed the government knew Afghan detainees were tortured. This was a consistent result across all age groups, genders and geographic locations. It also concluded that 41% of respondents were dissatisfied with the governments transparency on the issue, and only 24% were satisfied. The remaining 35% were still <b>undecided</b> or had no opinion. As time progressed, 61% of Canadians still believed Afghan detainees were tortured in May 2010, according to an Ipsos-Reid poll. This poll also found that 52% of respondents believed that Stephen Harper and Canadian soldiers knew torture was occurring, and 75% believed senior military officials would have known about the problem. A poll done by Angus Reid during 5 January and 6, found that 38 per cent of Canadians believed that Harper used the 30 December 2009 prorogation to curtail the Canadian Afghan detainee issue.|$|E
5|$|An {{individuals}} {{right to}} privacy is one area of digital forensics which is still largely <b>undecided</b> by courts. The US Electronic Communications Privacy Act places limitations {{on the ability of}} law enforcement or civil investigators to intercept and access evidence. The act makes a distinction between stored communication (e.g. email archives) and transmitted communication (such as VOIP). The latter, being considered more of a privacy invasion, is harder to obtain a warrant for. The ECPA also affects the ability of companies to investigate the computers and communications of their employees, an aspect that is still under debate as {{to the extent to which}} a company can perform such monitoring.|$|E
5|$|At {{seventeen}} years of age, Watts entered the 2008 season primarily playing school football with Brighton Grammar in the Associated Public Schools of Victoria (APS) competition, instead of under-18 {{level in the}} TAC Cup with the Sandringham Dragons. He was completing year eleven and could choose to nominate for the AFL draft in either 2008 or 2009; touted as a likely early draft pick despite being a year younger than most of his fellow draft prospects, he spent {{the majority of the}} season <b>undecided</b> on whether he would nominate for the 2008 draft. He did, however, state that he would remain in Victoria in 2009 to complete year twelve at Brighton Grammar even if he was recruited by an interstate team.|$|E
5|$|Brock {{continually}} {{kept the}} commanders of his posts informed of all developments. When {{news of the}} outbreak of war reached him, he sent a canoe party under the noted trader and voyager William McKay to the British outpost at St. Joseph Island on Lake Huron. His orders to commander (Captain Charles Roberts) allowed him {{to stand on the}} defensive or attack the nearby American outpost at Fort Mackinac at his discretion. Roberts immediately launched an attack on Fort Mackinac with a scratch force of regulars, fur traders, and First Nations warriors. On 17 July, the American garrison was taken by surprise (not being aware that war had been declared) and surrendered. This victory immediately encouraged many First Nations tribes, who had hitherto been neutral or <b>undecided,</b> to give their active support to the British. They hoped to expel the American settlers from their territories west of the Appalachian Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Cheney campaigned against Al Gore's running mate, Joseph Lieberman, in the 2000 presidential {{election}}. While {{the election}} was <b>undecided,</b> the Bush-Cheney team was not eligible for public funding to plan a transition to a new administration. So, Cheney opened a privately funded transition office in Washington. This office worked to identify candidates for all important positions in the cabinet. According to Craig Unger, Cheney advocated Donald Rumsfeld for the post of Secretary of Defense to counter the influence of Colin Powell at the State Department, and tried unsuccessfully to have Paul Wolfowitz named to replace George Tenet {{as director of the}} Central Intelligence Agency.|$|E
5|$|Following the Cup win, Selänne {{contemplated}} retirement. He remained <b>undecided</b> on a return—and {{as a free}} agent, out of the Ducks lineup {{to begin}} the 2007–08 season—until he finally chose to return and signed a one-year contract with Anaheim on January 28, 2008. He made his return on February 5 against the New York Islanders, and the Ducks posted the League's best record from that point {{to the end of}} the regular season by winning 20 of 26 games. In his third game back, Selänne scored his 670th point as a member of the Ducks with an assist in a 4–2 victory over the Calgary Flames. With it, he broke Kariya's franchise record of 669.|$|E
5|$|Following the speech, Nixon {{formally}} selected Governor Spiro Agnew of Maryland as {{his running}} mate, who received 1119 delegate votes, with the distant second being Governor Romney with 186. Agnew was relatively unknown nationally, and was selected due to his purported appeal to African Americans, and work for the Nixon campaign after an embarrassing experience {{as the head of}} the Draft Rockefeller movement. It was later noted that the convention had featured Nixon as the centrist candidate with Rockefeller to his left and Reagan to his right. The same analysis applied to the general campaign, as commentators noted that Nixon would stand to the right of the still <b>undecided</b> Democratic nominee but would fall to the left of American Independent Party candidate George Wallace.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, {{while the}} Claimant was serving his prison sentence, {{interest}} was briefly {{raised by the}} claims of William Cresswell, an inmate of a Sydney lunatic asylum, that he was Arthur Orton. There was circumstantial evidence that indicated some connection with Orton, and the Claimant's supporters campaigned to have Cresswell brought to England. Nothing came of this, although the question of Cresswell's possible identity remained a matter of dispute for years. In 1884 a Sydney court found the matter <b>undecided,</b> and ruled that the status quo should be maintained; Cresswell stayed in the asylum. Shortly {{before his death in}} 1904 he was visited by the contemporaneous Lady Tichborne, who found no physical resemblance to any member of the Tichborne family.|$|E
5|$|In 1918–19, the Senators won {{the second}} half of the split {{schedule}}. Clint Benedict had the top goalkeeper average, and Cy Denneny and Frank Nighbor placed third and fourth in scoring with 18 and 17 goals in 18 games, respectively. The schedule was abbreviated by the Toronto Arenas club suspending operations, so the Senators and Canadiens played off in the first best-of-seven series. Due to a family bereavement, Ottawa was without star centre Frank Nighbor for the first three games and lost all three. Ottawa asked to use Corb Denneny of Toronto, but the Canadiens turned down the request. Nighbor returned for the fourth game in Ottawa, which Ottawa won 6–3. The series ended in five games, as the Canadiens won the final match 4–2 to win the series. The Stanley Cup final between Montreal and Seattle was left <b>undecided,</b> as an influenza outbreak suspended the final.|$|E
5|$|In April 1985, Wilkinson {{formed a}} {{campaign}} committee {{in advance of}} the 1987 gubernatorial election. Relatively unknown statewide, Wilkinson was the first candidate to enter the race. The Democratic primary field eventually grew to include two previous Kentucky governors, John Y. Brown, Jr. and Julian Carroll; sitting Lieutenant Governor Steve Beshear, who would later win two terms as governor in 2007 and 2011; and Grady Stumbo, cabinet secretary for Governor Martha Layne Collins. Early in the race, Brown was the clear-cut favorite, while Wilkinson was picked to finish fifth. Wilkinson financed his own campaign and campaign manager Danny Briscoe suggested that he hire a campaign consultant {{to reach out to the}} state's large concentration of <b>undecided</b> voters. After a few interviews, Wilkinson hired a then-unknown political consultant named James Carville; Carville later went on to chair Bill Clinton's successful presidential campaign in 1992.|$|E
5|$|In April 1992, ITV offered Parry an {{improved}} bid of £34 million per year, which bettered the BBC's joint-bid with BSkyB. East was confident of closing the deal – he {{was supported by}} 11 club chairmen and was informed that ITV's rivals {{would have to come}} up with £100 million a year to better their offer. Parry was <b>undecided</b> as to which bid he preferred; though he favoured a non-exclusive deal with ITV, he wanted the reconsider its decision to work with subscription companies. He harboured the idea of a football channel and noted SBC's approval amongst other clubs. Parry also hoped BSkyB would increase their bid, which they later did.|$|E
5|$|Intermittently, Penn State named Johnson, {{the lone}} {{remaining}} holdover from the Joe Paterno era, the interim {{head coach in}} an effort to stabilize the program to prevent recruit defection, as well as prevent current players, namely quarterback Hackenberg, whose father commented that he was <b>undecided</b> on whether or not to return, from transferring. A few weeks later, however, it appeared Hackenberg would return, as Ferguson followed through on his plans to transfer, and Franklin lauded Hackenberg in his introductory press conference. After the announcement of O'Brien's departure, star wide receiver Allen Robinson, a junior, declared that he would forgo his senior season, and enter the 2014 NFL Draft; according to projections from a CBSSports.com mock draft, Robinson would likely be selected in the late first round.|$|E
5|$|On October 5, 1949, Douglas made a radio {{appearance}} announcing her candidacy. She attacked Downey almost continuously {{throughout the}} remainder of the year, accusing him of being a do-nothing, a tool of big business, and an agent of oil interests. She hired Harold Tipton, a newcomer to California who had managed a successful congressional campaign in the Seattle area, as her campaign manager. Douglas realized that Nixon would most likely be the Republican nominee, and felt that were she to win the primary, the wide gap between Nixon's positions and hers would cause voters to rally to her. Downey, who suffered from a severe ulcer, was initially <b>undecided</b> about running, but announced his candidacy in early December in a speech that included an attack on Douglas. Earl Desmond, a member of the California State Senate from Sacramento whose positions were similar to Downey's, also entered the race.|$|E
