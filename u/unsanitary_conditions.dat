5|$|Although {{he claimed}} he was {{reluctant}} to enter politics, Hugh Mason became the first Liberal elected councillor for Ashton-under-Lyne in November 1856. He represented the Portland Place ward from 1856 until his retirement from politics in 1874. Mason quickly made an impression and was elected mayor for three consecutive years between 1857 and 1860, which had never happened before. He supported progressive measures such as opening a public park, providing public libraries, and addressing <b>unsanitary</b> <b>conditions</b> in parts of Ashton-under-Lyne.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012, the United States Food and Drug Administration {{issued a}} warning to the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group {{regarding}} HAACP (hazard analysis and critical control points) violations that were found at a processing plant in Irving, Texas. FDA found that lemon and lime juice was held in <b>unsanitary</b> <b>conditions,</b> which was a potential health threat to consumers. Company managers were advised by FDA that a reduction in microorganism levels was necessary to protect consumers.|$|E

50|$|In 1818 Orpen was {{appointed}} a medical inspector, which entailed visiting {{the homes of}} thousands of poor people in Dublin during the fever years of 1818/1819. He was shocked at their living conditions and criticised the landlords for the <b>unsanitary</b> <b>condition</b> of their properties. He later wrote a pamphlet based on his experiences, An Address to the Public on the State of the Poor in Dublin, Especially Connected with the Prevention of Cholera.|$|R
5|$|The borough {{was not one}} {{of those}} {{reformed}} by the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835, and continued to exist {{under the control of the}} Lord of the Manor and the Court Leet until its final abolition in 1886. The Public Health Act of 1848 led to the creation of Altrincham's Local Board of Health in 1851 to address the <b>unsanitary</b> <b>conditions</b> created by the town's growing population– the first such board in Trafford.|$|E
5|$|While it {{was first}} intensifying as a {{tropical}} storm, Lupit affected Pohnpei, passing about 120km (75mi) north of Oroluk. Wind gusts peaked at 69km/h (43mph), and the storm dropped 160mm (6.28in) of rainfall. Later, the storm affected Chuuk Atoll in the FSM on November23. Tropical storm force winds were experienced through the state, and rainfall reached 162mm (6.37in) on Chuuk and 195mm (7.68in) on Ulul. The Chuuk state government helped people in low-lying areas to evacuate. High waves flooded homes, and damaged roads and seawalls. About 200houses were damaged or destroyed, and many homes affected by the typhoon had <b>unsanitary</b> <b>conditions,</b> a contaminated water supply, or lack of food. High winds downed banana and palm trees, and salt water damaged or wrecked all of the food crops in Chuuk.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} after the storm, airstrikes and attacks {{continued}} elsewhere in the country, and only days after Chapala, Cyclone Megh followed a similar path, causing additional damage. Relief distribution was disrupted due to the poor communications in the region, worsened by the ongoing civil war, with the hardest hit areas under al-Qaeda control; aid trucks had to pass security clearances, resulting in delays. Workers began restoring communications and clearing roads in {{the days after}} the storm. By 19November, most of the displaced residents had returned home, although some remained in shelters due to house damage. Southern portions of Yemen saw food and fuel shortages following the two storms. Mukalla experienced an outbreak of dengue fever by January 2016 due to the floods, affecting 1,040people; earlier efforts to kill disease carrying mosquitoes were ineffective due to residual floods and <b>unsanitary</b> <b>conditions.</b> Seven people died due to the outbreak. A locust outbreak also began in December 2015 due to the floods.|$|E

His health status was jeopardized and he lost weight dramatically due to the <b>unsanitary</b> <b>condition</b> of the ill lit and poorly ventilated prison cell. He was deprived of access to media and {{the outside world and}} was only allowed to see his wife and close relatives. All of Geagea’s conversations were monitored and he was barred from talking politics with anyone.|$|R
5000|$|In {{moving to}} the Ffriddoedd site, the {{intention}} had been to move out to the countryside. After the typhoid outbreak, and with the <b>unsanitary</b> <b>condition</b> of the lower Adda valley, Ffriddoedd {{was seen as a}} healthy rural alternative. However, the development of the city was to catch up. To preserve a little of that rural idyll as the area developed, Dr. R. L. Archer, a former Chairman of the Governors, in 1955 bequeathed to the school a small plot of land. Known as [...] "Dr. Archer's plot", this was to be planted with flowers and kept for ever green.|$|R

25|$|Milk {{collected}} or {{stored in}} <b>unsanitary</b> <b>conditions</b> may harbor {{a host of}} disease-causing organisms (pathogens), such as tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis), the bacteria Campylobacter (Campylobacteriosis), Escherichia E. coli O157:H7), Listeria (Listeriosis), Salmonella (Salmonellosis), Yersinia (Yersinia enterocolitica), and Brucella (Brucellosis). Pasteurization consistently removes all of these pathogens, though they can be reintroduced if the product is handled carelessly. Thus dairy farms that pasteurize their milk can have unsanitary facilities without the attendant outbreaks of disease that would occur if a raw milk dairy kept its herds in similar <b>unsanitary</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E

This {{calls for a}} need to map out suitable collection points and disposal point for effective and efficient management of solid waste to promote hygienic environment. Therefore, GIS offers solution in this regard as a decision support system for most suitable site selection. Consequently, different layers (roads, stream and land use) were created to serve the purpose of manipulation and analyses to procure most suitable site for collection point of solid waste generated in New Owerri, Imo State using Arc view 3. 2 a software...|$|R

The business and residential portion had gradually shifted northward. The spot where the bar--the particular one which I had rejected for the laundry--had formerly stood was now the commercial centre of the city. The man who had purchased it in place of Josiah had sold out and made a fortune. The southern area (where the laundry was situate) was, it had been discovered, built upon a swamp, and was in a highly <b>unsanitary</b> <b>condition.</b> Careful housewives naturally objected to sending their washing into such a neighbourhood.|$|R

It differs from foot rot and can appear under <b>unsanitary</b> <b>conditions</b> such as poor hygiene or inadequate hoof trimming, among other causes. It primarily affects dairy cattle and has been known to lower the quantity of milk produced, however the milk quality remains unaffected. Cattle are also susceptible to ringworm caused by the fungus, Trichophyton verrucosum, a contagious skin disease which may be transferred to humans exposed to infected cows.|$|E

Other factors, such as malnutrition, population displacement, <b>unsanitary</b> <b>conditions,</b> and lack of health care, further increased disease fatalities. Millions were impoverished as the crisis overwhelmed large segments of the economy and social fabric, accelerating a trend toward economic inequality.|$|E
25|$|This {{increase}} will be {{most dramatic}} on the least-urbanized continents, Asia and Africa. Surveys and projections indicate that all urban growth over the next 25 years will be in developing countries. One billion people, almost one-seventh of the world's population, now live in shanty towns. In many poor countries overpopulated slums exhibit high rates of disease due to <b>unsanitary</b> <b>conditions,</b> malnutrition, and lack of basic health care. By 2030, over 2 billion {{people in the world}} will be living in slums. Over 90% of the urban population of Ethiopia, Malawi and Uganda, three of the world's most rural countries, already live in slums.|$|E

That same year Fernandina was declared a free port; it began to ship great quantities of Florida cotton and lumber, and became a resort for the smuggling business and contraband slave trade. The town entered a boom period of extraordinary growth, with finer residences and crude shacks springing up next to each other. Vegetable gardens were planted haphazardly about, and the streets {{were little more than}} crooked paths. The unsightly and <b>unsanitary</b> <b>condition</b> of Fernandina disturbed Governor White, and on May 10, 1811, two days after Clarke's appointment as surveyor general, he instructed him to plat the town so that the streets were properly aligned and the lots were uniform.|$|R
