500|$|Tina fell in {{love for}} the first time with a boy named Harry. She spoke about this {{relationship}} in her 1986 interview with Rolling Stone. [...] "It was a basketball game – the school Harry attended was playing my school. I was just graduating from junior high. Well, I looked across the gym and saw Harry, and I {{fell in love}}. My heart was beating so fast. I'm a very bold person, so I ran down to the coach and said, 'Who is number 9?' I just had to have that guy. And he said, 'His name is Harry.' And then he told Harry that I had asked who he was. And Harry looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I'll never forget it; it was love at first sight." [...] She recalls he was a playboy,"Harry was real popular and had tons of girlfriends, but eventually I got him, and we went steady for a year." [...] The reason for their break-up she says, [...] "Harry and I broke up because he started playing around. He started dating a girl named Theresa, and by the time he and I got back together, she had become pregnant. He felt he should marry her. I wish he had told me his decision himself, but he didn't. One morning I got on the bus to school, and my friend said, 'Did you hear that Theresa and Harry got married?' I had to go a full day without crying. At the end of the day, I cried it all out." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{dawn of the}} day the {{operation}} was to take place , Dick Aldrich called : Gertrude had become comatose; would I please come to the hospital at once? [...] I found her surrounded by interns frantically pumping intravenous fluids and stimulants into her. [...] As I bent over her, she opened her eyes for a second or two, looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> made a face as if to say, [...] "What are you doing here?" ...|$|E
60|$|In {{surprise}} {{she looked}} <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> then {{down at the}} pearls upon her satin slippers.|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> defensively <b>and</b> for {{a moment}} neither of us spoke.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he looked}} <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> again, <b>and</b> swore {{one of his}} great oaths.|$|R
60|$|The jury {{retired to}} {{consider}} their verdict. I stood in suspense in the dock, with my heart loudly beating. Emily remained {{in the body of}} the court below, looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> tearfully <b>and</b> penitently.|$|R
6000|$|DOWN {{the stone}} stairs Girls with their large {{eyes wide with}} tragedy Lift looks of shocked and momentous emotion [...] <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> I smile.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{the woman}} came forward again, her head rather ducked. But she looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> smiled, with that odd, {{immediate}} intimacy, something witch-like and impossible.|$|E
60|$|He lay on {{his back}} and stared <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> his eyes had a glassy stare. Then he roused himself by an effort, and raised himself upon his elbow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Won't {{have you}} forward!" [...] said Montgomery, in a menacing voice. [...] "But I {{tell you to}} go!" [...] He {{was on the brink}} of saying {{something}} further, then looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> suddenly <b>and</b> followed <b>me</b> up the ladder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Walter," [...] he replied, looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> kindly, <b>and</b> {{speaking}} in English once more, {{as if his}} one anxiety now was {{to get back to}} our former relations towards each other. [...] "Come to my little bit of breakfast before I go my ways among the pupils that I teach." ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{a moment}} there was silence. Ajor looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> a hurt <b>and</b> {{questioning}} expression on her face. [...] "Whose she is this?" [...] repeated Al-tan.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked around}} quickly. Hollis lay {{across the table}} with his head down upon his outstretched arms. And then he looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> laughed in his {{ordinary}} manner.|$|E
6000|$|From {{that soft}} nest the happy one [...] Looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> calmly smiled; [...] Its hair shone golden in the sun, [...] And {{made it seem}} a heavenly child.|$|E
60|$|He laughed for answer, with {{something}} of exultation in his voice. He swung {{me to his}} shoulder, and held me poised there, looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> then he laughed again.|$|E
60|$|Isaac looked <b>up</b> {{in amazement}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> Melissa craning our necks {{over the edge}} of the roof. Then he saw the dog and took in the situation. The {{creature}} actually grinned.|$|R
60|$|I {{asked her}} if she could make the descent alone--if she were not afraid. She smiled <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> bravely <b>and</b> shrugged her shoulders. She afraid! So {{beautiful}} is she that I am always having difficulty in remembering that she is a primitive, half-savage cave girl of the stone age, and often find myself mentally limiting her capacities to those of the effete and overcivilized beauties of the outer crust.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{then they}} went on, and took no notice of me for a time. Lax came <b>up</b> <b>and</b> scowled <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> told <b>me</b> that if a word was said I should never draw the breath of life again." ...|$|R
60|$|He stopped, and {{his face}} was downcast and hidden. Then he looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> went on, making no further attempt to {{disguise}} his absolute belief in the reality of his story.|$|E
6000|$|We sat {{over the}} fire in the evening, and talked a little of surface things, but that died away, and after {{a quarter of an hour}} or so, he looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "And what next?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then the Hare sat itself down, {{planting}} its forepaws {{firmly in}} front of it, as these animals do when {{they are on the}} watch, looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> began to pour the contents of its mind into mine.|$|E
6000|$|... "Garm," [...] I said, [...] "we {{are going}} back to Stanley at Kasauli. Kasauli--Stanley; Stanley Kasauli." [...] And I {{repeated}} it twenty times. It was not Kasauli really, but another place. Still I remembered what Stanley had said in my garden on the last night, and I dared not change the name. Then Garm began to tremble; then he barked; and then he leaped <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> frisking <b>and</b> wagging his tail.|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> quickly, <b>and</b> then, for {{the first}} time since I had known her, took my arm of her own accord. No words could have {{expressed}} so delicately that she understood how the permission to leave my employment had been granted, and that she gave me her sympathy, not as my superior, but as my friend. I had not felt the man's insolent letter, but I felt deeply the woman's atoning kindness.|$|R
60|$|I foresaw that {{it would}} be {{difficult}} to make my exit with dignity, and I wished to goodness that I had not returned to London till Mrs. Strickland had composed her difficulties. I stole a glance at her. She was immersed in thought. Presently she looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> sighed deeply, <b>and</b> smiled.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did not move. It looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> wagged its tail. Then it drew back--I suppose because I had {{no words}} for it. I watched it run {{half-round}} {{the room and}} stop and look at me again. Then it slunk out.|$|E
6000|$|She looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{with her}} eyes she said, [...] "How could I help knowing?" [...] She might have {{intended}} to say something with her lips, but I took my answer from her eyes, and with the quick impulse of a lover I stopped her speech.|$|E
60|$|The gangster-leader, no sailor, but, {{after months}} at sea, {{intelligent}} enough and nervously {{strong enough to}} appreciate the danger, {{turned his head and}} looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> I will do him the credit to say that he took his time while all our world of gear aloft seemed smashing to destruction.|$|E
60|$|Half {{a minute}} later Bill cut open the {{mattress}} and began to search through the stuffing, while I struck matches and watched 'im. It wasn't a big mattress and there wasn't much stuffing, but we couldn't seem to see that money. Bill went all over it ag'in and ag'in, and then 'e stood <b>up</b> <b>and</b> looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> caught 'is breath painful.|$|R
5000|$|At {{eight o'clock}} I was summoned {{and handed over}} to me a letter of the doctor, from which I deduced {{that it is time}} to take my wife away, for the child will not live longer. I walked away a little confused, and found my wife {{completely}} burst in tears when I arrived. I took them by the hand and took them to her apartments. Then I went back with the sick child. I had only been for a while when she sat <b>up,</b> looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> said with a clear voice, [...] "I commend myself, O my God!". Then she fell back and died in my arms.|$|R
6000|$|... “That’s Uma,” said Case, and {{he called}} her up and spoke {{to her in the}} native. I didn’t know what he said; but {{when he was in the}} midst she looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> quick <b>and</b> timid, like a child dodging a blow, then down again, and {{presently}} smiled. She had a wide mouth, the lips and the chin cut like any statue’s; and the smile came out for a moment and was gone. Then she stood with her head bent, and heard Case to an end, spoke back in the pretty Polynesian voice, looking him full in the face, heard him again in answer, and then with an obeisance started off. I had just a share of the bow, but never another shot of her eye, and there was no more word of smiling.|$|R
6000|$|Charmion {{shivered and}} made answer: [...] "It is true, O Queen; I also {{was of the}} plot, and because Harmachis scorned me I betrayed him; and because of my great love for him I have {{remained}} unwed." [...] And she glanced <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> caught my eyes, then let the modest lashes veil her own.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Looking miserable won't bring 'er {{back to life}} agin,' ses the skipper, looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> {{shaking his}} 'ead. 'You'd better go down to my cabin and get {{yourself}} a drop o' whisky; there's a bottle on the table. You'll want all your wits about you when the police come. And wotever you do don't say nothing to criminate yourself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|In the parlour, the father, big and comfortable, was {{sleeping}} in an arm-chair. Emily was writing at the table—she hurriedly hid her papers when I entered. George was sitting by the fire, reading. He looked up as I entered, and I loved him when he looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> as he lingered on his quiet [...] "Hullo!" [...] His eyes were beautifully eloquent—as eloquent as a kiss.|$|E
60|$|Because I bade her go {{and feed}} the calves, She took that old book {{down out of the}} thatch And has been doubled over it all day. We would be {{deafened}} by her groans and moans Had she to work as some do, Father Hart, Get <b>up</b> <b>at</b> dawn like <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> mend and scour; Or ride abroad in the boisterous night like you, The pyx and blessed bread under your arm.|$|R
6000|$|Because I bid her {{clean the}} pots for supper [...] She took that old book {{down out of}} the thatch; [...] She has been doubled over it ever since.
