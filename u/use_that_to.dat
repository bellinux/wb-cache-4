5|$|Nixon was a late {{convert to}} the {{conservation}} movement. Environmental policy {{had not been}} a significant issue in the 1968 election; the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject. He saw that the first Earth Day in April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject, and sought to <b>use</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> his benefit; in June he announced the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his State of the Union speech; other initiatives supported by Nixon included the Clean Air Act of 1970 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); the National Environmental Policy Act required environmental impact statements for many Federal projects. Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act of 1972—objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them, which he deemed excessive. After Congress overrode his veto, Nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable.|$|E
5|$|The {{image of}} the masque within the play deals with hiding one's identity. Fielding, like many other playwrights, focuses on how the masque genre deals with the social {{acceptability}} of altering identities within the format. However, Fielding extends the image to discuss society and those who impersonate social and gender roles {{that they do not}} fill. Fielding also has a problem with those who act viciously with license even though he is willing to accept some of the lesser libertine actions. Merital, for instance, is a sexual type of libertine and is treated differently than those like Sir Positive Trap, Lord Formal, and Sir Apish Simple who are criticised as being part of the corrupted order. Trap and Formal are part of old families, and their attachment to the age of their families and their attempts to <b>use</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> justify their beliefs over what is proper is ridiculed within the play. In particular, Merital is the one able to point out their flaws.|$|E

500|$|Matt Hills' {{concept of}} the [...] "cult blockbuster" [...] {{involves}} cult followings inside larger, mainstream films. [...] Although these are big budget, mainstream films, they still attract cult followings. [...] The cult fans differentiate themselves from ordinary fans in several ways: longstanding devotion to the film, distinctive interpretations, and fan works. [...] Hills identifies three different cult followings for The Lord of the Rings, each with their own fandom separate from the mainstream. [...] Academic Emma Pett identifies Back to the Future (1985) as {{another example of a}} cult blockbuster. [...] Although the film topped the charts when it was released, it has developed a nostalgic cult following over the years. [...] The hammy acting by Christopher Lloyd and quotable dialogue draw a cult following, as they mimic traditional cult films. [...] Blockbuster science fiction films that include philosophical subtexts, such as The Matrix, allow cult film fans to enjoy them on a higher level than the mainstream. Star Wars, with its large cult following in geek subculture, has been cited as both a cult blockbuster and a cult film. [...] Although a mainstream epic, Star Wars has provided its fans with a spirituality and culture outside of the mainstream. [...] Fans, in response to the popularity of these blockbusters, will claim elements for themselves while rejecting others. [...] For example, in the Star Wars film series, mainstream criticism of Jar Jar Binks focused on racial stereotyping; although cult film fans will <b>use</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> bolster their arguments, he is rejected because he represents mainstream appeal and marketing. [...] Also, instead of valuing textual rarity, fans of cult blockbusters will value repeat viewings. [...] They may also engage in behaviors more traditional for fans of cult television and other serial media, as cult blockbusters are often franchised, preconceived as a film series, or both. [...] To reduce mainstream accessibility, a film series can be self-reflexive and full of in-jokes that only longtime fans can understand.|$|E

2500|$|Sergi López as Captain Vidal, Ofelia's new {{stepfather}} and a Falange officer. Del Toro {{met with}} López in Barcelona, {{a year and}} a half before filming began, to ask him to play Vidal. In Spain, López was considered a melodramatic or comedic actor, and the producers told Del Toro [...] "You should be very careful because you don't know about these things because you're Mexican, but this guy is not going to be able to deliver the performance"; del Toro replied [...] "Well, it's not that I don't know, it's that I don't care". Of his character, López said: [...] "He is the most evil character I've ever played in my career. It is impossible to improve upon it; the character is so solid and so well written. Vidal is deranged, a psychopath who is impossible to defend. Even though his father's personality marked his existence—and is certainly one of the reasons for his mental disorder—that cannot be an excuse. It would seem to be very cynical to <b>use</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> justify or explain his cruel and cowardly acts. I think it is great that the film does not consider any justification of fascism." ...|$|E
