5|$|Arévalo's {{response}} {{toward the}} non-communist unions was mixed. In 1945, he criminalized all rural labor unions in workplaces {{with fewer than}} 500 workers, which included most plantations. One of the few unions big enough to survive this law was of the banana workers employed by the UFC. In 1946 this union organized a strike, which provoked Arévalo into outlawing all strikes until a new labor code was passed. This led to efforts {{on the part of}} employers to stall the labor code, as well as to exploit workers as far as possible before it was passed. The unions were also damaged when the US government persuaded the American Federation of Labor to found the Organización Regional Internacional del Trabajo (ORIT), a <b>union</b> <b>that</b> took a virulently anti-communist stance.|$|E

50|$|According to the Legal Defense Foundation, right-to-work laws {{prohibit}} {{union security}} agreements, or agreements between employers and labor <b>unions,</b> <b>that</b> govern {{the extent to}} which an established union can require employees' membership, payment of union dues, or fees as a condition of employment, either before or after hiring. Right-to-work laws do not aim to provide general guarantee of employment to people seeking work, but rather are a government regulation of the contractual agreements between employers and labor <b>unions</b> <b>that</b> prevents them from excluding non-union workers, or requiring employees to pay a fee to <b>unions</b> <b>that</b> have negotiated the labor contract all the employees work under.|$|R
5|$|Born {{in rural}} Russia in 1902, Suslov {{became a member}} of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1921 and studied {{economics}} for much of the 1920s. He left his job as a teacher in 1931 to pursue politics full-time, becoming one of the many Soviet politicians who took part in the mass repression begun by Joseph Stalin's regime. Suslov impressed the Soviet leadership to such an extent in the pre-Eastern Front Soviet <b>Union</b> <b>that</b> he was made First Secretary of Stavropol Krai administrative area. During the war, Suslov headed the local Stavropol guerrilla movement. He {{became a member of}} the Organisational Bureau (Orgburo) of the Central Committee in 1946 and, four years later, was elected to the Presidium (Politburo) of the All-Union Communist Party.|$|E
5|$|By {{virtue of}} the Iberian <b>Union</b> <b>that</b> joined the crowns of Portugal and Spain in 1580, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 had fallen in abeyance.

She married Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine, and like her brother, had no issue. Gian Gastone, Cosimo's eventual successor, despised {{his father and his}} court.

40|$|This paper applies {{principles}} from {{evolutionary biology}} {{to the study}} of <b>unions.</b> We show <b>that</b> <b>unions</b> <b>that</b> implement the preferred wage and organizing policies of workers will be displaced in evolutionary competition by <b>unions</b> <b>that</b> either extract less from firms, allowing them to live longer, or spend more on union organizing, or both. This implies <b>that</b> <b>unions</b> with constitutional incumbency advantages that allow leaders to depart from members' preferences may have a selective advantage, allowing them to grow at the expense of unions lacking such provisions. Evidence from the history of American unions supports these predictions. (JEL A 12, J 51) ...|$|R
5|$|In 1798, {{members of}} the Protestant Dissenter {{tradition}} (mainly Presbyterian) made common cause with Roman Catholics in a republican rebellion inspired and led by the Society of United Irishmen, {{with the aim of}} creating an independent Ireland. Despite assistance from France the rebellion was put down by British and Irish government and yeomanry forces.

5|$|Josce de Dinan (died 1166) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman {{who lived}} {{during and after}} the civil war between King Stephen of England and his cousin Matilda over the throne of England. He was a landholder in the Welsh Marches when he was married by Stephen to the widow of Pain fitzJohn, a <b>union</b> <b>that</b> gave Josce control of Ludlow Castle. Control of the castle was contested by other noblemen, and the {{resulting}} warfare between the nobles forms the background to a late medieval romance known as Fouke le Fitz Waryn, which is mainly concerned with the actions of Josce's grandson, but also includes some material on Josce's lifetime. Josce eventually lost control of Ludlow and was granted lands in compensation by Matilda and her son, King Henry II of England, who succeeded Stephen in 1154.|$|E

5|$|Parrish, {{upset with}} the {{ineffectiveness}} of the association, proposed forming a players' <b>union,</b> <b>that</b> would be independent of the NFLPA, {{with the assistance of}} the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT). The IBT pushed for the NFLPA to join the trucking union. In early November 1967, Parrish, with support from former Cleveland Browns player Jim Brown, began distributing union cards to form a Teamsters affiliate known as the American Federation of Pro Athletes. The NFLPA rejected the overture at its meeting in Hollywood, Florida, during the first week of January 1968 and declared itself an independent union. Although Parrish's proposal was defeated, Miller left his position as counsel to the union. He was later replaced by two Chicago labor lawyers, Dan Schulman and Bernie Baum.|$|E

5|$|Since 2003, {{the park}} is under the {{administrative}} authority of the 'Northern Pindus Management Body'. This authority {{is responsible for the}} ecological management of a much larger region that includes eight protected areas in Greece, also part of the Natura 2000, an initiative by the governments of the European <b>Union</b> <b>that</b> aims to protect the most seriously threatened habitats and species across Europe. The 'Northern Pindus Management Body', together with the local forest service, is responsible for regulating human activities and maintaining the ecological value of the protected area. However,until now this target remains elusive, {{because of a lack of}} expertise and of a science-based management plan. A great need therefore exists to conduct conservation-oriented research that can be translated directly into practical management proposals.|$|E
5|$|The 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt, {{commonly}} referred to as the August Coup, was prompted by the slow disintegration of the Soviet <b>Union</b> <b>that</b> resulted from Gorbachev's reform policy and Yeltsin's drive towards an independent Russia. The New Union Treaty being prepared called for further decentralisation of power to the republics, which weakened the government's already tenuous hold on the economy.

Disque met with mill owners {{and representatives of the}} Industrial Workers of the World, the <b>union</b> <b>that</b> was trying to organize loggers and sawmill workers in the Pacific Northwest. After studying the situation for several months, Disque determined that the long-standing labor management dispute could not be resolved without direct intervention by the army.

Hoxhaj stated in 2014 that the country's goal is to be a NATO member by 2022. However, four NATO member states, Greece, Romania, Spain, and Slovakia, do not recognize Kosovo's independence. United Nations membership, which Kosovo does not have, is considered to be necessary for NATO membership.|$|E
5|$|In Scandinavia, Haakon {{regularly}} {{met with}} neighbouring rulers in the border-area around Elven {{from the late}} 1240s through the 1250s. Using grand fleets as envoys, Haakon's fleet at most reportedly counted over 300 ships. Haakon sought to expand his kingdom southwards of Elven into the Danish province of Halland. He thus looked for alliance with the Swedes, as well as ties with opponents of the ruling line of monarchs of Denmark. Haakon {{made a deal with}} Swedish leader Earl Birger in 1249 about a joint Swedish-Norwegian invasion into Halland and Scania, but the agreement was eventually abandoned by the Swedes (see Treaty of Lödöse). Haakon claimed Halland in 1253, and finally invaded the province on his own in 1256, demanding it as compensation for the looting of Norwegian ships in Danish seas. He was however forced to renounce his claims in 1257 after a peace agreement was made with Christopher I of Denmark. Haakon thereafter negotiated a marriage between his only remaining son Magnus and Ingeborg, daughter of former Danish king Eric Ploughpenny. Haakon had also reconciled with the Swedes when he had his son Haakon the Young marry a daughter of Earl Birger. Haakon's Nordic policies initiated the build-up to the later personal unions (called the Kalmar <b>Union),</b> <b>that</b> in the end had dire consequences for Norway as it did not have the economic and military resources to persevere and maintain Haakon's aggressive policies.|$|E
