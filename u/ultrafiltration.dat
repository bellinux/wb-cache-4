25|$|Kt/V {{does not}} take into account the role of <b>ultrafiltration.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Ultrafiltration</b> {{concentrates}} {{a protein}} solution using selective permeable membranes. The {{function of the}} membrane is to let the water and small molecules pass through while retaining the protein. The solution is forced against the membrane by mechanical pump, gas pressure, or centrifugation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ultrafiltration</b> {{membranes}} use polymer membranes with chemically formed microscopic pores {{that can}} be used to filter out dissolved substances avoiding the use of coagulants. The type of membrane media determines how much pressure is needed to drive the water through and what sizes of micro-organisms can be filtered out.|$|E
25|$|Thus an NHHD {{schedule}} {{results in}} a larger dose of hemodialysis per week, as do some SDHHD. More total time dialyzing, shorter periods between treatments {{and the fact that}} fluid removal speeds can be lower (thus reducing the symptoms resulting from rapid <b>ultrafiltration),</b> accounts for the advantages of these schedules over conventional ones.|$|E
25|$|Most solids can {{be removed}} using simple {{sedimentation}} techniques with the solids recovered as slurry or sludge. Very fine solids and solids with densities close to the density of water pose special problems. In such case filtration or <b>ultrafiltration</b> may be required. Although, flocculation may be used, using alum salts or the addition of polyelectrolytes.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{technologies}} {{used to treat}} wastewater for reuse. A combination of these technologies can meet strict treatment standards {{and make sure that}} the processed water is hygienically safe, meaning free from bacteria and viruses. The following are some of the typical technologies: Ozonation, <b>ultrafiltration,</b> aerobic treatment (membrane bioreactor), forward osmosis, reverse osmosis, advanced oxidation.|$|E
25|$|If a {{heart failure}} patient {{exhibits}} a resistance to or poor response to diuretic therapy, <b>ultrafiltration</b> or aquapheresis {{may be needed}} to achieve adequate control of fluid retention and congestion. The use of such mechanical methods of fluid removal can produce meaningful clinical benefits in patients with diuretic-resistant heart failure and may restore responsiveness to conventional doses of diuretics.|$|E
25|$|ELGA {{produces}} {{water purification}} systems which provide purified water and ultrapure water for applications {{in research and}} analytical laboratories, medical and clinical facilities. It incorporates in its water purifiers a combination of purification technologies, e.g. reverse osmosis, electronics-grade ion-exchange resins, microfiltration, <b>ultrafiltration,</b> degassing, ultraviolet photooxidation and electrodeionization. Products are designed to minimize {{impact on the environment}} at all stages - manufacture, in-service and at end of life.|$|E
25|$|Old, used {{cutting fluid}} must be {{disposed}} of when it is fetid or chemically degraded and has lost its usefulness. As with used motor oil or other wastes, {{its impact on the}} environment should be mitigated. Legislation and regulation specify how this mitigation should be achieved. Modern cutting fluid disposal involves techniques such as <b>ultrafiltration</b> using polymeric or ceramic membranes which concentrates the suspended and emulsified oil phase.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the size}} of the {{dispersed}} phase may be difficult to measure, and because colloids have the appearance of solutions, colloids are sometimes identified and characterized by their physico-chemical and transport properties. For example, if a colloid consists of a solid phase dispersed in a liquid, the solid particles will not diffuse through a membrane, whereas with a true solution the dissolved ions or molecules will diffuse through a membrane. Because of the size exclusion, the colloidal particles are unable to pass through the pores of an <b>ultrafiltration</b> membrane with a size smaller than their own dimension. The smaller {{the size of}} the pore of the <b>ultrafiltration</b> membrane, the lower the concentration of the dispersed colloidal particles remaining in the ultrafiltered liquid. The measured value of the concentration of a truly dissolved species will thus depend on the experimental conditions applied to separate it from the colloidal particles also dispersed in the liquid. This is particularly important for solubility studies of readily hydrolyzed species such as Al, Eu, Am, Cm, or organic matter complexing these species.|$|E
25|$|The {{sample is}} first conditioned, or {{prepared}} for purification. Cells, cell debris, lipids and clotted material are first removed, typically by centrifugation followed by filtration with a 0.45µm filter. These large particles {{can cause a}} phenomenon called membrane fouling in later purification steps. In addition, the concentration of product in the sample may not be sufficient, especially {{in cases where the}} desired antibody is produced by a low-secreting cell line. The sample is therefore concentrated by <b>ultrafiltration</b> or dialysis.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} direct potable reuse {{is the case}} of Windhoek (Namibia, New Goreangab Water Reclamation Plant (NGWRP)), where treated {{wastewater}} has been blended with drinking water for more than 40 years. It is based on the multiple treatment barriers concept (i.e. pre-ozonation, enhanced coagulation/dissolved air flotation/rapid sand filtration, and subsequent ozone, biological activated carbon/granular activated carbon, <b>ultrafiltration</b> (UF), chlorination) to reduce associated risks and improve the water quality. The reclaimed wastewater nowadays represent about 14% of the city’s drinking water production.|$|E
25|$|Other {{products}} fabricated {{with this}} process include various ceramic membranes for microfiltration, <b>ultrafiltration,</b> nanofiltration, pervaporation and reverse osmosis. If the liquid in a wet gel is removed under a supercritical condition, a highly porous and extremely low density material called aerogel is obtained. Drying the gel {{by means of}} low temperature treatments (25-100°C), {{it is possible to}} obtain porous solid matrices called xerogels. In addition, a sol-gel process was developed in the 1950s for the production of radioactive powders of UO2 and ThO2 for nuclear fuels, without generation of large quantities of dust.|$|E
25|$|Treated {{wastewater}} can be reused {{in industry}} (for example in cooling towers), in artificial recharge of aquifers, in agriculture {{and in the}} rehabilitation of natural ecosystems (for example in wetlands). In rarer cases it {{is also used to}} augment drinking water supplies. There are several technologies used to treat wastewater for reuse. A combination of these technologies can meet strict treatment standards and make sure that the processed water is hygienically safe, meaning free from bacteria and viruses. The following are some of the typical technologies: Ozonation, <b>ultrafiltration,</b> aerobic treatment (membrane bioreactor), forward osmosis, reverse osmosis, advanced oxidation.|$|E
25|$|Effluent {{from the}} {{pulp and paper}} {{industry}} is generally high in suspended solids and BOD. Plants that bleach wood pulp for paper making may generate chloroform, dioxins (including 2,3,7,8-TCDD), furans, phenols and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Stand-alone paper mills using imported pulp may only require simple primary treatment, such as sedimentation or dissolved air flotation. Increased BOD or COD loadings, as well as organic pollutants, may require biological treatment such as activated sludge or upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors. For mills with high inorganic loadings like salt, tertiary treatments may be required, either general membrane treatments like <b>ultrafiltration</b> or reverse osmosis or treatments to remove specific contaminants, such as nutrients.|$|E
25|$|TAILS, or “N-Terminomics,” was {{designed}} and developed by the Overall Lab to overcome the functional limitations of conventional proteomics by enriching both mature N-terminal peptides and newly generated N-terminal peptides of proteins produced by protease activity. Formaldehyde or isobaric tags including Isotope-coded Affinity Tags (ICAT), 4 to 8 plex Isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ), or 10plex Tandem mass tags (TMT) block primary amines prior to trypsin digestion of proteome samples. The main step of the process is the negative selection of newly generated trypsin peptides using a specialized polymer. The polymer ignores the unreactive primary amines blocked by their tags, allowing them {{to be separated from}} trypsin generated peptides by <b>ultrafiltration</b> for Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. These mature and neo-N-termini will differ in ratios between the protease treated versus untreated samples and make up the proteolytic fingerprint of a protease. TAILS is also compatible with Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC).|$|E
25|$|If {{rainwater}} is {{used for}} drinking, it is often filtered first. Filtration (such as reverse osmosis, ultraviolet sterilization, or <b>ultrafiltration)</b> may remove pathogens. While rain water is pure it may become contaminated during collection or by collection of particulate matter {{in the air as}} it falls. While rain water does not contain chlorine, contamination from airborne pollutants, which settles onto rooftops, may be a risk in urban or industrial areas. Many water suppliers and health authorities, such as the New South Wales Department of Health, do not advise using rainwater for drinking when there is an alternative mains water supply available. However, reports of illness associated with rainwater tanks are relatively infrequent, and public health studies in South Australia (the Australian state with the highest rainwater usage rate) have not identified a correlation. Rainwater is generally considered fit to drink if it smells, tastes and looks fine; However some pathogens, chemical contamination and sub-micrometre suspended metal may produce neither smell, taste and not be visible.|$|E
25|$|Membrane bioreactors (MBR) are {{activated}} sludge systems using a membrane liquid-solid phase separation process. The membrane component uses low pressure microfiltration or <b>ultrafiltration</b> membranes and {{eliminates the need}} for a secondary clarifier or filtration. The membranes are typically immersed in the aeration tank; however, some applications utilize a separate membrane tank. One of the key benefits of an MBR system is that it effectively overcomes the limitations associated with poor settling of sludge in conventional {{activated sludge}} (CAS) processes. The technology permits bioreactor operation with considerably higher mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration than CAS systems, which are limited by sludge settling. The process is typically operated at MLSS in the range of 8,000–12,000mg/L, while CAS are operated in the range of 2,000–3,000mg/L. The elevated biomass concentration in the MBR process allows for very effective removal of both soluble and particulate biodegradable materials at higher loading rates. Thus increased sludge retention times, usually exceeding 15 days, ensure complete nitrification even in extremely cold weather.|$|E
25|$|In {{almost every}} segment {{is a pair}} of {{excretory}} organs called nephridia, which are derived from coelom tissue. Each consists of a small pouch that is connected, via a flagellated conductor called a nephridioduct, to an opening {{at the base of the}} nearest leg known as a nephridiopore. The pouch is occupied by special cells called podocytes, which facilitate <b>ultrafiltration</b> of the blood through the partition between haemocoelom and nephridium. The composition of the urinary solution is modified in the nephridioduct by selective recovery of nutrients and water and by isolation of poison and waste materials, before it is excreted to the outside world via the nephridiopore. The most important nitrogenous excretion product is the water-insoluble uric acid; this can be excreted in solid state, with very little water. This so-called uricotelic excretory mode represents an adjustment to life on land and the associated necessity of dealing economically with water. A pair of former nephridia in the head were converted secondarily into the salivary glands, while another pair in the final segment of male specimens now serve as glands that apparently play a role in reproduction.|$|E
25|$|Self-assembly of nanofibrous {{scaffolds}} is able {{to occur}} only when the fibers themselves are engineered for self-assembly. One common way to drive the self-assembly of scaffold fibers is to use amphiphilic peptides so that in water the hydrophobic moiety drives the self-assembly. Carefully calculated engineering of the amphiphilic peptides allows for precise control over the self-assembled matrix. Self-assembly {{is able to}} create both ordered and unordered topographies. Phillips et al. (2005) developed and tested in vitro and in vivo a self-aligned collagen-Schwann cell matrix, which allowed DRG neurite extension alignment in vitro. Collagen gels have been used extensively as substrates for three-dimensional tissue culture. Cells are able to form integrin-mediated attachments with collagen, which initiates cytoskeleton assembly and cell motility. As cells move along the collagen fibers they generate forces that contract the gel. When the collagen fibers are tethered at both ends, cell-generated forces create uniaxial strain, causing the cells and collagen fibers to align. The advantages of this matrix are its simplicity and speed of preparation. Soluble plasma fibronectin can also self-assemble into stable insoluble fibers when put under direct mechanical shearing within a viscous solution. Phillips et al. (2004) investigated a new method of shear aggregation that causes an improved aggregation. The mechanical shearing was created by dragging out a 0.2 ml bolus to 3cm with forceps; fibronectin aggregates into insoluble fibers at the rapidly moving interface in an <b>ultrafiltration</b> cell. The proposed mechanism for this fiber aggregation is protein extension and elongation under mechanical shear force, which leads to lateral packing and protein aggregation of fibers. Phillips et al. showed that mechanical shear produced by stretching a high viscosity fibronectin gel causes substantial changes in its structure and that when applied through uniaxial extension, a viscous fibronectin gel forms oriented fibrous fibronectin aggregates; additionally, the fibrous aggregates have a decreased solubility and can support the various cell types in vitro.|$|E

2500|$|The math {{does not}} quite work out, and more {{complicated}} relationships have been worked-out {{to account for}} the fluid removal (<b>ultrafiltration)</b> during dialysis as well as urea generation(see urea reduction ratio). [...] Nevertheless, the URR and Kt/V are so closely related mathematically, that their predictive power {{has been shown to be}} no [...] different in terms of prediction of patient outcomes in observational studies.|$|E
2500|$|Finland, where {{approximately}} 17% of the Finnish-speaking {{population has}} hypolactasia, has had [...] "HYLA" [...] (acronym for hydrolysed lactose) products available for many years. Lactose of low-lactose level cow's milk products, ranging from ice cream to cheese, is enzymatically hydrolysed into glucose and galactose. The ultra-pasteurization process, combined with aseptic packaging, ensures a long shelf life. In 2001, Valio launched a lactose-free milk drink {{that is not}} sweet like HYLA milk but has the fresh taste of ordinary milk. Valio patented the chromatographic separation method to remove lactose. Valio also markets these products in Sweden, Estonia, Belgium, and the United States, where the company says <b>ultrafiltration</b> is used.|$|E
2500|$|When nocturnal {{dialysis}} {{is given}} 3 or 3.5 times (every other night) per week, the total weekly duration of dialysis is markedly prolonged, since each session typically lasts 6–8 hours, compared to 3–4 hours for conventional dialysis. [...] This gives benefits {{in terms of}} fluid removal and phosphate removal, although about 1/2 to 2/3 of patients receiving this kind of treatment will still require phosphate binders. [...] When such long nocturnal sessions are given 6x/week, in almost all patients phosphate binders can be stopped, and in a substantial number, phosphate needs {{to be added to}} the dialysate to prevent phosphate depletion. [...] Because of the long weekly dialysis time, fluid removal is very well controlled, as the rate of <b>ultrafiltration</b> is quite low.|$|E
2500|$|Vaccine {{production}} has several stages. First, the antigen itself is generated. Viruses are grown either on primary cells such as chicken eggs (e.g., for influenza) or on continuous cell lines such as cultured human cells (e.g., for hepatitis A). [...] Bacteria are grown in bioreactors (e.g., Haemophilus influenzae type b). Likewise, a recombinant protein {{derived from the}} viruses or bacteria can be generated in yeast, bacteria, or cell cultures. After the antigen is generated, it is isolated from the cells used to generate it. A virus {{may need to be}} inactivated, possibly with no further purification required. Recombinant proteins need many operations involving <b>ultrafiltration</b> and column chromatography. Finally, the vaccine is formulated by adding adjuvant, stabilizers, and preservatives as needed. The adjuvant enhances the immune response of the antigen, stabilizers increase the storage life, and preservatives allow the use of multidose vials. Combination vaccines are harder to develop and produce, because of potential incompatibilities and interactions among the antigens and other ingredients involved.|$|E

[...] <b>Ultrafiltration</b> is used {{for many of the}} same applications as microfiltration. Some <b>ultrafiltration</b> membranes have also been used to remove dissolved compounds with high molecular weight, such as proteins and carbohydrates. In addition, they are able to remove viruses and some endotoxins.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ultrafiltration</b> failure: The peritoneal mesothelium is {{implicated in}} the {{long-term}} development of <b>ultrafiltration</b> failure in peritoneal dialysis patients. The presence of supra-physiological glucose concentrations, acidity, and glucose degradation products in peritoneal dialysis fluids contribute to the fibrosis of the peritoneal mesothelium, either by epithelial-mesenchymal transition or increased proliferation of existing fibroblasts. A fibrosed peritoneum results in the increased passage of solutes across the peritoneum and <b>ultrafiltration</b> failure.|$|E

5000|$|Fromager d'Affinois {{is similar}} to Brie in production, appearance, and flavour. Unlike in Brie production, however, before cheese making the cow's milk {{undergoes}} a process called <b>ultrafiltration.</b> <b>Ultrafiltration</b> removes water from the pasteurised milk, concentrating all other components. [...] One effect {{of this process is}} that it allows the acceleration of the cheese making process. Whereas classic Brie takes eight weeks to make, Fromager d'Affinois can be made in two weeks. <b>Ultrafiltration</b> also results in a milk that retains more nutrients and proteins, and the cheese has a relatively high fat content of 60%.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ultrafiltration</b> (UF) is {{a variety}} of {{membrane}} filtration in which forces like pressure or concentration gradients lead to a separation through a semipermeable membrane. Suspended solids and solutes of high molecular weight are retained in the so-called retentate, while water and low molecular weight solutes pass through the membrane in the permeate (filtrate). This separation process is used in industry and research for purifying and concentrating macromolecular (103 - 106 Da) solutions, especially protein solutions. <b>Ultrafiltration</b> is not fundamentally different from microfiltration. Both of these separate based on size exclusion or particle capture. It is fundamentally different from membrane gas separation, which separate based on different amounts of absorption and different rates of diffusion. <b>Ultrafiltration</b> membranes are defined by the molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of the membrane used. <b>Ultrafiltration</b> is applied in cross-flow or dead-end mode.|$|E
50|$|Reverse osmosis is {{extensively}} used in {{the dairy}} industry {{for the production of}} whey protein powders and for the concentration of milk to reduce shipping costs. In whey applications, the whey (liquid remaining after cheese manufacture) is concentrated with reverse osmosis from 6% total solids to 10-20% total solids before <b>ultrafiltration</b> processing. The <b>ultrafiltration</b> retentate can then be used to make various whey powders, including whey protein isolate. Additionally, the <b>ultrafiltration</b> permeate, which contains lactose, is concentrated by reverse osmosis from 5% total solids to 18-22% total solids to reduce crystallization and drying costs of the lactose powder.|$|E
