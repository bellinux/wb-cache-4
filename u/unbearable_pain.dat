2500|$|Fearing that a Hohenzollern king in Prussia {{and another}} one in Spain would put France into a two-front situation, France this time was {{determined}} {{to stand up to}} the expansion of Prussian influence. Napoleon III at this time was suffering the most <b>unbearable</b> <b>pain</b> from his stones, and the Empress Eugénie essentially was charged with countering the designs of Prussia. She had a vital interest in the crisis as she was of Spanish blood and a member of the royal line. The secretary of foreign affairs, Duc Antoine de Gramont, was directed by the Empress to be the principal instrument by which France would press for war should Leopold ascend the throne. Gramont delivered a speech in front of the Chambre législative, proclaiming that [...] "We shall know how to fulfill our duty without hesitation and without weakness." [...] The fatal mistake would soon come as a result of Gramont's inexperience, for he counted on alliances that only existed in his mind.|$|E

A single word, she felt, might close it, and with the question that came to her lips as Mrs. Gereth paused she seemed to herself to ask, in cold dread, for her doom. [...] "What did you say to that?"

Had he met Father Beron in the street after all these years Dr. Monygham was sure he would have quailed before him. This contingency was not to be feared now. Father Beron was dead; but the sickening certitude prevented Dr. Monygham from looking anybody in the face.|$|E

6000|$|Citizens' {{wives in}} hood and wimple were there, shrilly {{bargaining}} for provision for their households, squires and grooms in quest of hay for their masters' stables, purveyors seeking {{food for the}} garrison, lay brethren and sisters for their convents, and withal, the usual margin of begging friars, wandering gleemen, jugglers and pedlars, though in no great numbers, as this was only a Wednesday market-day, not a fair. Ambrose recognised one or two who made part of the crowd at Beaulieu only two days previously, when he had [...] "seen through tears the juggler leap," [...] and the jingling tune {{one of them was}} playing on a rebeck brought back associations of almost <b>unbearable</b> <b>pain.</b> Happily, Father Shoveller, having seen his sheep safely bestowed in a pen, bethought him of bidding the lay brother in attendance show the young gentlemen the way to Hyde Abbey, and turning up a street at right angles to the principal one, they were soon out of the throng.|$|E
60|$|His {{gratitude}} was pathetic.... By {{this time}} I {{was so full}} of the subject that it fairly clamoured for expression, and as I wrote the hours flew. Once in a while I paused to ask him a question as he sat with his chair tilted back and his feet on the table, reading a detective story. I sketched in the scene with bold strokes; the desolate bois brule on the mountain side, the polished crystal surface of the pool broken here and there with the circles left by rising fish; I pictured Armand, the guide, his pipe between his teeth, holding the canoe against the current; and I seemed to smell the sharp tang of the balsams, to hear the roar of the rapids below. Then came the sudden hooking of the big trout, habitant oaths from Armand, bouleversement, wetness, darkness, confusion; a half-strangled feeling, a brief glimpse of green things and sunlight, and then strangulation, or what seemed like it; strangulation, the sense of being picked up and hurled by a terrific force whither? a blinding whiteness, in which it was impossible to breathe, one sharp, almost <b>unbearable</b> <b>pain,</b> then another, then oblivion.... Finally, awakening, to be confronted by a much worried Uncle Jake.|$|E

30|$|Less pain on {{attempting}} intercourse also {{resulted in}} less occasions where sexual intercourse had to be interrupted due to pain. After 3  years, {{the number of patients}} having infrequent sex declined fourfold, and the mean number of successful sexual contacts had increased by 27 %. These data suggest that women with introital dyspareunia have less sex because they anticipate that intercourse will be painful. Some authors have suggested that patients experiencing painful intercourse and decreased sexual activity or libido suffer “vaginism” or “frigidity” and need psychotherapy [16]. One in five of our patients was sent to a psychiatrist or had admitted of visiting one. We consider it more likely that most of these women simply became hopeless due to <b>unbearable</b> <b>pains</b> when attempting sexual contact, turning sexual activity into a burden decreasing their desire to have or allow sex. Hence, we don't support sending these women to psychotherapists as a first option, but rather try to exactly locate the pain, assess its cause and alleviate it first. Our excellent long-term postoperative satisfaction rates seem to fully support this view.|$|R

40|$|It {{is unfortunate}} {{to note that}} citadels of {{learning}} from where decorum and morality ought to diffuse to the larger society have been deleteriously affected by the seemingly insurmountable challenge of corruption. Oftentimes, politicians and political leaders are castigated for high-rate of corruption by academics, whereas, the so-called castigators themselves are not exonerated from this social malady. It is, therefore, {{the case of the}} pot calling the kettle black. Instead of choosing to be a different kettle of fish, academics have joined the enemy of the people in compounding their already <b>unbearable</b> <b>pains.</b> Adimora-Ezeigbo’s Trafficked has been examined mostly from gender perspective, while the other major issue of corruption has not been adequately dealt with. It is against the foregoing, therefore, that this paper investigates corrupt practices among academics as depicted in Trafficked. The paper is aimed at exploring the epidemics of corruption among academics. Postcolonial theory is adopted, while the examined text is subject to critical textual analysis. It is observed that Adimora-Ezeigbo diagnoses the effect of corruption in academia as it affects students, the nation and education system. Taking of bribery, making and selling of not-well-researched hand-outs, molestation and maltreatment of students form parts of the corrupt practices as portrayed in the novel...|$|R

This etiology was strengthened by PET/CT images showing F- 18 FDG avid osteolytic lesions but no abnormal uptake suggestive of a primary neoplasm.

40|$|Individuals {{awaiting}} execution {{have high}} rates of mental illness and psychological problems. We examined themes and psychological factors in last statements before execution in Texas between December 2006 and July 2011 (n 79) and compared them to our previous research on last statements between April 2002 and November 2006 (n 100). We used the Thematic Guide for Suicide Prediction to examine the state of mind of the prisoners facing imminent death. The most common themes in last statements were love (82 %), spirituality (52 %), and regret (39 %). The most common psychological factors were indirect expressions (43 %), identification-egression (i. e., identifica-tion with a lost or rejecting person or with any lost ideal) (40 %), rejection-aggression (38 %), and <b>unbearable</b> psychological <b>pain</b> (37 %). These features were constant over time. Evidence of deteriorating mental health, <b>unbearable</b> psychological <b>pain,</b> and increased suicide risk suggests an ethics-related medical duty for psychiatrists to object to the death sentence.

PRESENTATION OF CASEIn this report, we describe a young adult male presenting with left posterolateral chest wall pain. Chest computed tomography showed a calcified tumor in the left third posterior segment of the rib. Radical mass resection was performed and histopathology confirmed a benign osteoblastoma. At last follow-up, 10 months postoperatively, the patient has eventually relieved of the <b>unbearable</b> chest <b>pain.</b> Imaging evaluation revealed no evidence of recurrent tumor. DISCUSSIONOsteoblastoma is an uncommon primary bone tumor accounting for only 1 % of all bone tumors. Ribs are involved in less than 5 % of patients. The disease has usually good prognosis with a tendency for local destruction and recurrence.

50|$|In 1909, Rajanikanta started {{suffering}} from throat problems. On 10 September {{of the same}} year he was forced to move to Calcutta along with some family members despite very stringent financial conditions. A British doctor examined him and diagnosed it as Larynx cancer. He consulted various eminent doctors in Calcutta but his condition did not improve. As a last resort, he spent a couple of months in Varanasi with the hope of divine intervention. With a very heavy heart he had to sell off copyrights of his published books Vani and Kalyani to arrange for the trip. He had to return to Calcutta as his condition had worsened much. He underwent Tracheotomy operation by Captain Denham White on 10 February 1910 in Calcutta Medical College. He survived the operation but lost his voice forever. He spent the remaining days of his life in the Cottage Ward of the hospital. He used to write in his diary quite regularly during his stay in the hospital. He also started writing autobiography which was written only up to the first chapter.Some poetry lovers and some of the students of the Calcutta Medical College tended after him, Maharaja Manindra Chandra Nandi and Sharat Kumar Ray helped him financially. On 11 June 1910 Rabindranath Tagore visited the hospital to meet Rajani. Rajani's son Kshitindranath and daughter Shantibala sung a song composed by Rajani and he accompanied by playing a Harmonium. Rajani believed that God inflicted the pain upon him for the purification of his soul. This belief gave him the inner strength to forget the physical pain temporarily and immerse himself in the composition of songs.This is reflected in the following song composed on the day Rabindranath met him:Rajani sent this poem to Bolpur for Rabindranath. Touched by the warmth of the verses, Rabindranath wrote a letter to him on 30 July. In this, he has highly appreciated Rajani for his literary talent and glorified his remarkable endurance and inner strength which inspires him to keep writing amidst the unbearable pain.During this period, he also composed a few Agamani and Vijaya songs.Rajani's last few days were full of <b>unbearable</b> <b>pains.</b> He died on 13 September 1910.|$|R
