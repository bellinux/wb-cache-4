5000|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, US 9W was truncated southward {{to end in}} Albany while US 9E was redesignated as just US 9 and reconfigured to bypass Waterford to the west {{in favor of a}} direct alignment between Albany and Round Lake. At the same time, US 9W was realigned through New Baltimore and Coeymans to use modern NY 144 instead. The portion of what is <b>now</b> <b>US</b> 9W <b>from</b> <b>New</b> Baltimore to Albany was originally designated as NY 144 as part of the 1930 renumbering while the segment from Catskill to Coxsackie was assigned NY 385 [...] The alignments of US 9W and NY 385 were swapped by the following year while the routings of US 9W and NY 144 were flipped in April 1935 ...|$|R
50|$|Most {{of modern}} NY 144 was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} NY 10 when {{the first set of}} posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924. NY 10 joined what is now NY 144 at Coeymans and followed it north through Bethlehem to Albany, where NY 10 continued into the city on modern NY 32. When U.S. Highways were first posted in New York in 1927, all of NY 10 south of Albany became part of US 9W. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, US 9W was realigned through the towns of New Baltimore and Coeymans to use modern NY 144 instead. At the same time, the portion of what is <b>now</b> <b>US</b> 9W <b>from</b> <b>New</b> Baltimore to Albany was designated as NY 144. The alignments of US 9W and NY 144 north of New Baltimore were flipped in April 1935. Initially, NY 144 entered Albany, overlapping with NY 32 along South Pearl Street to US 20 in the downtown district. It was truncated to its current northern terminus south of Albany in the late 1960s.|$|R
