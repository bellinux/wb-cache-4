25|$|These beliefs were {{complemented by}} {{a belief that}} laborers could be best {{motivated}} by financial incentive. This belief led {{to the passage of}} the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, which limited the provision of social assistance, {{based on the idea that}} markets are the mechanism that most efficiently leads to wealth. Adopting Thomas Malthus's population theory, they saw poor <b>urban</b> <b>conditions</b> as inevitable, they believed population growth would outstrip food production and they regarded that consequence desirable, because starvation would help limit population growth.

25|$|The {{first major}} urban {{planning}} theorist was Sir Ebenezer Howard, who initiated the garden city movement in 1898. This {{was inspired by}} earlier planned communities built by industrial philanthropists in the countryside, such as Cadburys' Bournville, Lever's Port Sunlight and George Pullman's eponymous Pullman in Chicago. All these settlements decentralised the working environment from {{the centre of the}} cities, and provided a healthy living space for the factory workers. Howard generalised this achievement into a planned movement for the country as a whole. He was also influenced by the work of economist Alfred Marshall who argued in 1884 that industry needed a supply of labour that could in theory be supplied anywhere, and that companies have an incentive to improve workers living standards as the company bears much of the cost inflicted by the unhealthy <b>urban</b> <b>conditions</b> in the big cities.|$|E

A report entitled [...] "The Governor's Commission for a Sustainable South Florida", submitted to Lawton Chiles in 1995, identified the problems the state and municipal governments were facing. The report remarked that the degradation of the natural quality of the Everglades, Florida Bay, and other bodies of water in South Florida would cause a significant decrease in tourism (12,000jobs and $200million annually) and income from compromised commercial fishing (3,300jobs and $52million annually). [...] The report noted that past abuses and neglect of the environment had brought the region to [...] "a precipitous juncture" [...] where the inhabitants of South Florida faced health hazards in polluted air and water; furthermore, crowded and unsafe <b>urban</b> <b>conditions</b> hurt the reputation of the state. It noted that though the population had increased by 90% over the previous two decades, registered vehicles had increased by 166%.

60|$|Let me briefly recapitulate {{the main}} {{problems}} which {{have to be}} attacked {{in the attempt to}} realise the outline of the Great State. At the base of the whole order there must be some method of agricultural production, and if the agricultural labourer and cottager and the ancient life of the small householder on the holding, a life laborious, prolific, illiterate, limited, and in immediate contact with the land used, is to recede and disappear it must recede and disappear before methods upon a much larger scale, employing wholesale machinery and involving great economies. It is alleged by modern writers that the permanent residence of the cultivator in close relation to his ground is a legacy from the days of cumbrous and expensive transit, that the great proportion of farm work is seasonal, and that a migration to and fro between rural and <b>urban</b> <b>conditions</b> would be entirely practicable in a largely planned community. The agricultural population could move out of town into an open-air life as the spring approached, and return for spending, pleasure, and education as the days shortened. Already something of this sort occurs under extremely unfavourable conditions in the movement of the fruit and hop pickers from the east end of London into Kent, but that is a mere hint of the extended picnic which a broadly planned cultivation might afford. A fully developed civilisation, employing machines in the hands of highly skilled men, will minimise toil to the very utmost, no man will shove where a machine can shove, or carry where a machine can carry; but there will remain, more particularly in the summer, a vast amount of hand operations, invigorating and even attractive to the urban population Given short hours, good pay, and all the jolly amusement in the evening camp that a free, happy, and intelligent people will develop for themselves, and there will be little difficulty about this particular class of work to differentiate it from any other sort of necessary labour.|$|E

This area is close to both the crowded city center and the crowded suburbs but possesses a hefty inertia in a reputation of crime and ugliness. The land itself is virtually useless; most of the earth is reclaimed (unwanted fill from elsewhere), and any hopes of plant life are quashed by road/rail sprawl, ceaseless paving, and a blanketing of low-rise warehouses. In short, this area claims all the ailments of the inner city and none of its triumphs. Connecting modes of transportation allows an assembly of physical form as a paradigmatic juxtaposition. The site, currently empty and infertile, will contain an ideal <b>urban</b> <b>condition</b> of high-density living and the ideal rural construct of an orchard.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} investigates how non-profit organisations (NPOs) {{can function}} more efficiently by sharing resources and services. The design responds with {{the strategy of}} service integration, by transforming the facilities of POPUP, a single NPO, into a shared services hub for multiple NPOs. POPUP is a People Upliftment Programme in Salvokop, Pretoria, and serves the under-privileged communities of Pretoria with skills development courses. The dissertation aims to create restorative environments for these students and explores the theoretical approaches of regenerative design, biophilic design and restorative environmental design. The premise of the investigation is that humanity has an inherent inclination towards nature and that a healthy human-nature connection enables the healing process. Furthermore, the dissertation follows a contextual approach that responds to the railway heritage significance of Salvokop, the <b>urban</b> <b>condition</b> of disconnection from the Central Business District, {{as well as the}} self-restoration of the natural landscape. The study seeks to regenerate the human-nature connection, a manifestation of the connection between the current natural landscape and the <b>urban</b> <b>condition.</b> In this way, restorative environments are created that contribute to the regeneration of people.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to improve}} our {{understanding}} {{of the relationship between the}} city and civil conflict and violence. The thesis is building on the explanation that urbanisation and cities are at the heart of societal transformation as 'complex forms of social life and not as previously reduced to a partial phenomenon, an accidental aspect or to a backdrop of societal changes. Conversely societal change not only occurs on the city-space but becomes an integral part of the makeup of the city. In relation to the subject of conflict and violence, the thesis argues that cities generate conditions that catalyse and alter related social, economic, political and cultural processes that intensify these phenomena. The city becomes. more than just 'a site where powerful external forces intersect, intensifying differences and conflicts among local groups' (Susser and Schneider, 2003 : 1). It acts like a prism that changes the trajectory of processes that happen initially outside its 'gates' and stirs and intensifies them generating the conditions for accelerated conflict. Reciprocally, the thesis argues that cities are shaped by the very processes that occur and intersect through them. The city, as a dynamic entity, is influenced by these processes and changes aCGordingly. Through studying the case of Beirut, the thesis will explain how the city and the <b>urban</b> <b>condition</b> shape social, political and spatial dynamics producing accelerated conflict and violence; and how the city in turn was shaped by these dynamics in four particulars~ Firstly, urban differentials in the settlement pattern of sectarian groups or communities in the. city and their outcome in terms ot-the relationship between the old arid new uroanifes. -ú.. Secondly, the dynamics of inter-communal social relations in the city and the role of the <b>urban</b> <b>condition</b> in shaping social intera~tions between communities. Thirdly, the influence of the <b>urban</b> <b>condition</b> on shaping the political process and politicisation of communities.
