5|$|RNA {{thermometers}} {{sensitive to}} temperatures of 37°C {{can be used}} by pathogens to activate infection-specific genes. For example, the <b>upregulation</b> of prfA, encoding a key transcriptional regulator of virulence genes in Listeria monocytogenes, was demonstrated by fusing the 5' DNA of prfA to the green fluorescent protein gene; the gene fusion was then transcribed from the T7 promoter in E. coli, and fluorescence was observed at 37°C but not at 30°C.|$|E
5|$|Helper T cells express T {{cell receptors}} (TCR) that {{recognize}} antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules. The MHC:antigen complex is also {{recognized by the}} helper cell's CD4 co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the T cell (e.g., Lck) {{that are responsible for}} the T cell's activation. Helper T cells have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer T cells, meaning many receptors (around 200–300) on the helper T cell must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the helper cell, while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule. Helper T cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell. The activation of a resting helper T cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells. In addition, helper T cell activation causes an <b>upregulation</b> of molecules expressed on the T cell's surface, such as CD40 ligand (also called CD154), which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells.|$|E
5|$|The finger {{bones of}} bats {{are much more}} {{flexible}} than those of other mammals, owing to their flattened cross-section and to low levels of minerals, such as calcium, near their tips. The elongation of bat digits, a key feature required for wing development, {{is due to the}} <b>upregulation</b> of bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps). During embryonic development, the gene controlling Bmp signaling, Bmp2, is subjected to increased expression in bat forelimbs—resulting in the extension of the manual digits. This crucial genetic alteration helps create the specialized limbs required for volant locomotion. The relative proportion of extant bat forelimb digits compared with those of Eocene fossil bats have no significant differences in relative digit proportion, suggesting that bat wing morphology has been conserved for over 50 million years. During flight, the bones take on bending and shearing stress; and the bending stresses felt are smaller than terrestrial mammals, however the shearing stress is larger. The wing bones of bats have a slightly lower breaking stress point than those of birds.|$|E
30|$|To {{determine}} if the transcription activity of Sp 1 was affected by SENP 3, we measured mRNA levels of several target genes of Sp 1. VEGF, cyclin D and Bcl- 2 were obviously transcriptionally upregulated in SENP 3 overexpression cells, but these <b>upregulations</b> were almost completely prevented in cells with SENP 3 overexpression plus Sp 1 knockdown. The transcription of survivin was slightly affected (Fig.  5 E).|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} current {{knowledge}} on {{the involvement of}} peripheral lymphocytes in hepatitis E virus (HEV) associated pathogenesis, we analyzed alterations in (1) immunophenotypic expressions (by flow cytometry) and (2) gene expression patterns (by TaqMan Low Density Array) of activatory, inhibitory, integrin, homing, ectonucleotidase machinery, costimulatory, inflammatory markers, and T regulatory cells (Treg) associated cytokines on HEV rORF 2 p stimulated and unstimulated PBMCs of 43 acute HEV patients, 30 recovered individuals, and 43 controls. The phenotypic expressions of key molecules CTLA- 4, GITR, CD 103, CD 25, CD 69, IL 10 and TGF-β 1 in the acute patients and TGF-β 1 in the recovered individuals were significantly elevated on both unstimulated and stimulated PBMCs. Gene expression array data revealed <b>upregulations</b> of CD 25, PD 1, CD 103, CCR 4, IL 10, and TGF-β 1 on both unstimulated and HEV rORF 2 p stimulated PBMCs of acute patients. The observed <b>upregulations</b> of inhibitory, integrin, activatory, and Treg-associated cytokine genes on the PBMCs of acute HEV patients complemented by their frequency data suggest them as the {{major players in the}} fine-tuning of immune response in self-limiting hepatitis E infection...|$|R
40|$|Gossypol is a {{phenolic}} aldehyde {{extracted from}} plants {{and is known}} to be an antitumor agent to induce cancer cell apoptosis. In the present study, multiple myeloma cells were treated with gossypol, which resulted in an increase of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell necrosis. Quantitative proteomic analysis was carried out to identify differentially expressed proteins between untreated and gossypol-treated cells. Proteomic analysis identified 4330 proteins, in which 202 proteins are upregulated and 383 proteins are downregulated in gossypol-treated cells as compared to the untreated cells. Importantly, proteomic and western blot analysis showed that apoptosis regulators BAK and Bax were upregulated in gossypol-treated cells, indicating that Bcl- 2 associated death pathway was activated. Similarly, gossypol also induced <b>upregulations</b> of DNA mismatch repair proteins and DNA replication licensing factor, suggesting that gossypol caused significant DNA damage. Furthermore, <b>upregulations</b> of HLA class I and class II histocompatibility antigens and beta- 2 -microglobulin were observed in gossypol-treated cells, indicating that gossypol has a novel function to activate cellular immune responses. Our data demonstrate that the execution of necrosis is a complex process involving ROS, DNA damage, and Bcl- 2 family proteins. Gossypol-activated immune responses are a potential new approach for multiple myeloma chemotherapy...|$|R

40|$|In {{myocardial}} disease, elevated {{expression and}} activity of Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE 1) are detrimental. To {{better understand the}} involvement of NHE 1, transgenic mice with elevated heart-specific NHE 1 expression were studied. N-line mice expressed wild-type NHE 1, and K-line mice expressed activated NHE 1. Cardiac morphology, interstitial fibrosis, and cardiac function were examined by histological staining and echocardiography. Differences in gene expression between the N-line or K-line and nontransgenic littermates were probed with genechip analysis. We found that NHE 1 K-line (but not N-line) hearts developed hypertrophy, including elevated heart weight-to-body weight ratio and increased cross-sectional area of the cardiomyocytes, interstitial fibrosis, as well as depressed cardiac function. N-line hearts had modest changes in gene expression (50 <b>upregulations</b> and 99 downregulations, P < 0. 05), whereas K-line hearts {{had a very strong}} transcriptional response (640 <b>upregulations</b> and 677 downregulations, P < 0. 05). In addition, the magnitude of expression alterations was much higher in K-line than N-line mice. The most significant changes in gene expression were involved in cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac necrosis/cell death, and cardiac infarction. Secreted phosphoprotein 1 and its signaling pathways were upregulated while peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ signaling was downregulated in K-line mice. Our study shows that expression of activated NHE 1 elicits specific pathways of gene activation in the myocardium that lead to cardiac hypertrophy, cell death, and infarction...|$|R
40|$|Direct {{maxacalcitol}} (OCT) injection into a {{parathyroid gland}} (PTG) ameliorates several important etiologic factors {{of resistance to}} medical treatments for secondary hyperparathyroidism (s-HPT) : the <b>upregulations</b> of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and Ca-sensing receptor (CaSR) in PTGs and the regression of PTG hyperplasia by the induction of apoptosis. In this study, we evaluated the bone histomorphology {{on the basis of}} maintaining these effects in advanced s-HPT. Five/six nephrectomized Sprague–Dawley rats were fed a high-phosphorus and low-calcium diet for 8 weeks. These rats were divided into four treatment groups: (1) basic uremic (at the baseline), (2) direct OCT single injection into PTGs (DI-OCT) followed by OCT intravenous administration for 4 weeks (IV-OCT), (3) direct vehicle injection and IV-OCT, and (4) no treatment for an additional 4 weeks. The effects of these treatments on serum intact-parathyroid hormone (PTH) level, PTG weight, VDR and CaSR expression levels in PTGs, and bone histomorphometric parameters were investigated. In the DI-OCT+IV-OCT group, the significant decrease in serum intact-PTH level was maintained by the following IV-OCT. A significant decrease in PTG weight and the <b>upregulations</b> of VDR and CaSR expression levels in PTGs were also observed. Bone histomorphometric analysis showed significant improvements in osteitis fibrosa in both cancellous and cortical bones. However, these findings were not observed in the other groups. These results suggest that osteitis fibrosa caused by advanced s-HPT can be successfully reversed by a control of PTH at an appropriate level through the improvement of PTG hyperplasia as induced by DI-OCT+IV-OCT...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study reviews {{evidence}} that implicates high glucose (HG) in {{the pathogenesis of}} peritoneal fibrosis and proposes mechanisms potentially involved in the HG-induced peritoneal fibrosis that is observed in long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. ♦ Design: Selected Western literature is reviewed, examining the effect of HG on rat or human peritoneal mesothelial cell (HPMC) biology with particular reference to extracellular matrix (ECM) gene expression and protein synthesis. ♦ Results: HG up-regulated the expression of monocyte chemotactic peptide– 1 (MCP- 1), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ 1), and fibronectin messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and proteins. These HG-induced <b>upregulations</b> were effectively blocked by the inhibition o...|$|R

25|$|Transcriptomic {{profiling}} {{also provides}} crucial information on mechanisms of drug resistance. Analysis of over 1000 Plasmodium falciparum isolates identified that <b>upregulation</b> of the unfolded protein response and slower progression {{through the early}} stages of the asexual intraerythrocytic developmental cycle were associated with artemisinin resistance in isolates from Southeast Asia.|$|E

40|$|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a {{frequent}} neurodegenerative process in old age. Accumulation and aggregation of the lipid-binding SNARE complex component alpha-synuclein (SNCA) underlies this vulnerability and defines stages of disease progression. Determinants of SNCA levels and mechanisms of SNCA neurotoxicity have been intensely investigated. In view of the physiological roles of SNCA in blood to modulate vesicle release, we studied blood samples from a new large pedigree with SNCA gene duplication (PARK 4 mutation) to identify effects of SNCA gain of function as potential disease biomarkers. Downregulation of complexin 1 (CPLX 1) mRNA was correlated with genotype, but the expression of other Parkinson's disease genes was not. In global RNA-seq profiling of blood from presymptomatic PARK 4 indviduals, bioinformatics detected significant <b>upregulations</b> for platelet activation, hemostasis, lipoproteins, endocytosis, lysosome, cytokine, Toll-like receptor signaling and extracellular pathways. In PARK 4 platelets, stimulus-triggered degranulation was impaired. Strong SPP 1, GZMH and PLTP mRNA <b>upregulations</b> were validated in PARK 4. When analysing individuals with {{rapid eye movement sleep}} behavior disorder, the most specific known prodromal stage of general PD, only blood CPLX 1 levels were altered. Validation experiments confirmed an inverse mutual regulation of SNCA and CPLX 1 mRNA levels. In the 3 '-UTR of the CPLX 1 gene we identified a single nucleotide polymorphism that is significantly associated with PD risk. In summary, our data define CPLX 1 as a PD risk factor and provide functional insights into the role and regulation of blood SNCA levels. The new blood biomarkers of PARK 4 in this Turkish family might become useful for PD prediction...|$|R
40|$|Free-living amoebae of {{the genus}} Acanthamoeba are causative agents of granulomatous amebic {{encephalitis}} and amebic keratitis. Because the virulence of Acanthamoeba culbertsoni cultured in the laboratory is restored by consecutive brain passages, we examined the genes induced in mouse brain-passaged A. culbertsoni by differential display reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (DDRT-PCR). Enhanced A. culbertsoni virulence was observed during the second mouse brain passage, i. e., infected mouse mortality increased from 5 % to 70 %. Ten cDNAs induced during mouse brain passage were identified by DDRT-PCR and this was confirmed by northern blot analysis. BlastX searches of these cDNAs indicated the <b>upregulations</b> of genes encoding predictive NADH-dehydrogenase, proteasomal ATPase, and GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase B, which have previously {{been reported to be}} associated with A. culbertsoni virulence factors...|$|R
40|$|The {{changes of}} {{relative}} mRNA levels of seven different genes, coding for key cell cycle regulatory factors (Cyclins D and E, kinases Wee 1 and Myt 1, Phosphatase Cdc 25 (String), Dacapo (p 27), and Pcna) were performed using qRT-PCR method. Two reference genes (Rp 49 and ?-tubulin) {{served as a}} background. Significant transcriptional response to photoperiodic transfer were observed for two genes. While the relative levels of Dacapo mRNA increased during the rapid entry into G 2 arrest, the Pcna expression was significantly downregulated during the beginning of G 0 /G 1 arrest. Moderate transcriptional <b>upregulations</b> of the genes coding for two cell cycle inhibitory kinases, Wee 1 and Myt 1 accompanied the entry into diapause. The other genes were expressed equally in all photoperiodic conditions...|$|R
25|$|The innate {{system works}} with the {{adaptive}} immune system to mount a response against the DNA encoded protein. CpG-S sequences induce polyclonal B-cell activation and the <b>upregulation</b> of cytokine expression and secretion.

30|$|Mice {{treated with}} DCE- 2.5 or DCE- 5 showed {{markedly}} hypertrophic hepatocytes with eosinophilic cytoplasms, while those treated with DCE- 10 showed slightly hypertrophic hepatocytes, which were well aligned in hepatic cords with increased sinusoidal spaces. DCE induced the <b>upregulations</b> of cellular proliferation, growth factor/RAS signaling, cellular protection, p 53 -mediated apoptosis, angiogenesis, and antioxidant and protection-related proteins, and the downregulations of NFkB signaling proteins, inflammatory proteins, and oncogenic proteins in mouse livers. These protein expression changes induced by DCE were usually {{limited to the}} range[*]±[*] 10 %, suggesting murine hepatocytes were safely reactive to DCE within the threshold of physiological homeostasis. DCE- 2.5 and DCE- 5 induced relatively mild dose-dependent changes in protein expressions for cellular regeneration and de novo angiogenesis as compared with non-treated controls, whereas DCE- 10 induced fluctuations in protein expressions.|$|R
40|$|During cell stress, the {{transcription}} and translation of immediate early genes are prioritized, while most other messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are stored away in stress granules or degraded in processing bodies (P-bodies). TIA- 1 is an mRNA-binding protein {{that needs to}} translocate from the nucleus to seed the formation of stress granules in the cytoplasm. Because other stress granule components such as TDP- 43, FUS, ATXN 2, SMN, MAPT, HNRNPA 2 B 1, and HNRNPA 1 are crucial for the motor neuron diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) /spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and for the frontotemporal dementia (FTD), here we studied mouse nervous tissue to identify mRNAs with selective dependence on Tia 1 deletion. Transcriptome profiling with oligonucleotide microarrays in comparison of spinal cord and cerebellum, together with independent validation in quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR and immunoblots demonstrated several strong and consistent dysregulations. In agreement with previously reported TIA 1 knock down effects, cell cycle and apoptosis regulators were affected markedly with expression changes up to + 2 -fold, exhibiting increased levels for Cdkn 1 a, Ccnf, and Tprkb vs. decreased levels for Bid and Inca 1 transcripts. Novel and surprisingly strong expression alterations were detected for fat storage and membrane trafficking factors, with prominent + 3 -fold <b>upregulations</b> of Plin 4, Wdfy 1, Tbc 1 d 24, and Pnpla 2 vs. a − 2. 4 -fold downregulation of Cntn 4 transcript, encoding an axonal membrane adhesion factor with established haploinsufficiency. In comparison, subtle effects on the RNA processing machinery included up to 1. 2 -fold <b>upregulations</b> of Dcp 1 b and Tial 1. The effect on lipid dynamics factors is noteworthy, since also the gene deletion of Tardbp (encoding TDP- 43) and Atxn 2 led to fat metabolism phenotypes in mouse. In conclusion, genetic ablation of the stress granule nucleator TIA- 1 has a novel major effect on mRNAs encoding lipid homeostasis factors in the brain, similar to the fasting effect...|$|R
30|$|In our {{previous}} study, dialyzed coffee extract (DCE) and artificial coffee (AC) induced protein expressions in RAW 264.7 cells were compared by IP-HPLC analysis. DCE, which contains {{most of the}} minor components of coffee (including chlorogenic acid and caffeine), induced the expressions of proteins required for essential cellular functions in RAW 264.7 cells, while AC (1 [*]mM chlorogenic acid and 2 [*]mM caffeine, which are the same concentrations found in DCE) induced a quite different protein expressional pattern as determined by IP-HPLC. DCE caused the <b>upregulations</b> of proteins associated with cellular proliferation and protection, and antioxidant-related proteins, and the downregulations of apoptosis-related, angiogenesis-related, and oncogenic proteins; and enhanced cMyc/MAX, Rb/E 2 F, and RAS, growth factor signaling as well as osteogenesis in RAW 264.7 cells. Actually, overall protein expressional changes after DCE treatment revealed a signaling circuit triggered by antioxidant-related proteins and genetic/epigenetic activation [16].|$|R

The collected samples were tested by kinetic, ELISA, RT-PCR and other molecular techniques. The obtained results showed that The Fas- <b>upregulations</b> don't change in case of positive viral C infection related to HCC and also in non- HCC.

The biotechnological production of lycopene from Yarrowia lipolytica is an emerging scope that has not been fully scrutinized, especially for what concerns cultivation conditions of newly generated engineered strains. In this study, by combining flux balance analysis (FBA) and Plackett-Burman design, we screened chemicals for lycopene production from a metabolically engineered strain of Y. lipolytica. Lycopene concentrations of 126 and 242 mg/L were achieved correspondingly from the FBA-independent and the FBA-assisted designed media in fed-batch cultivation mode. Transcriptional studies revealed <b>upregulations</b> of heterologous genes in media designed according to FBA, thus implying the efficiency of model predictions.

40|$|The {{presynaptic}} protein alpha-synuclein {{has received}} much attention because its gain-of-function {{is associated with}} Parkinson’s disease. However, its physiological function is still poorly understood. We studied brain regions of knock-out mice at different ages with regard to consistent <b>upregulations</b> of the transcriptome and focused on glyoxalase I (GLO 1). The microarray data were confirmed in qPCR, immunoblot, enzyme activity, and behavior analyses. GLO 1 induction is a known protective cellular response to glucose stress, representing efforts to decrease toxic levels of methylglyoxal (MG), glyoxal and advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). Mass spectrometry quantification demonstrated a ubiquitous increase in MG and fructosyl-lysine as consequences of glucose toxicity, and consistent enhancement of certain AGEs. Thus, GLO 1 induction in KO brain seems insufficient to prevent AGE formation. In conclusion, the data demonstrate GLO 1 expression and glycation damage to be induced by alphasynuclein ablation. We propose that wild-type alpha-synuclein modulates brain glucose metabolism...|$|R

A 65 -year-old male was admitted the hospital because of left pleuritic chest pains in 2004. Chest computed tomography (CT) results showed left pleural effusions with loculation and pleural thickening. Pathologic findings revealed reactive mesothelial hyperplasia. In 2008, the patient again felt left pleuritic chest pains. Chest CT showed progressive thickening of the left pleura. Pathologic diagnosis was atypical mesothelial hyperplasia. In 2011, chest CT showed progressive thickening of his left pleura. He was diagnosed with well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma.

40|$|Ghrelin, a {{multifunctional}} gut-brain hormone, {{is involved}} in the regulation of gastric functions in mammals. This study aimed to determine whether ghrelin modulates digestive enzymes in goldfish (Carassius auratus). Immunofluorescence microscopy found colocalization of ghrelin, GHS-R 1 a and the digestive enzymes sucrase-isomaltase, aminopeptidase A, trypsin and lipoprotein lipase in intestinal and hepatopancreatic cells. In vitro ghrelin treatment in intestinal and hepatopancreas explant culture led to a concentration- and time-dependent modulation (mainly stimulatory) of most of the digestive enzymes tested. The ghrelin-induced <b>upregulations</b> of digestive enzyme expression were all abolished by preincubation with the GHS-R 1 a ghrelin receptor antagonist [D-Lys 3]-GHRP- 6, and most of them by the phospholipase C inhibitor U 73122 or the protein kinase A inhibitor H 89. This indicates that ghrelin effects on digestive enzymes are mediated by GHS-R 1 a, partly by triggering the PLC/PKC and AC/PKA intracellular signaling pathways. These data suggest a role for ghrelin on digestive processes in fish...|$|R
40|$|Results {{from recent}} {{clinical}} trials {{have indicated that}} recombinant interferon-beta (rIFN-beta) is a promising drug {{for the treatment of}} Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a disease of supposed autoimmune etiology. To gain insight into the immunoregulatory properties of this cytokine, we analyzed effects of interferon-beta (IFN-beta) on T-cell functions in vitro. Interferon-beta inhibited T-cell proliferation, as well as T-cell-dependent immunoglobulin secretion, in a dose-dependent manner. IFN-beta did not inhibit <b>upregulations</b> of CD 40 L on activated T-cells, but blocked induction of CD 25 on stimulated T- and B-lymphocytes. Secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumour necrosis alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL- 13 was inhibited by the addition of IFN-beta, whereas IL- 4 secretion was unaffected. Interestingly, IFN-beta enhanced secretion of IL- 2 about two-fold and secretion of IL- 10 nearly four-fold. In summary, these findings suggest that IFN-beta may exert direct effects on T- and beta-cell function in vivo. In addition, enhanced secretion of IL- 10 by activated T-cells may interfere with newly initiated and ongoing inflammatory immune reaction...|$|R
