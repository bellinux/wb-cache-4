5|$|A 2015 {{study of}} the necks of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus found many {{differences}} between them and other diplodocids, and that these variations may {{have shown that the}} necks of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus were used for intraspecific combat. Various uses for the single claw on the forelimb of sauropods have been proposed. One suggestion is that they were used for defense, but their shape and size make this unlikely. It was also possible they were for feeding, but the most probable <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> claw was grasping objects such as tree trunks when rearing.|$|E
5|$|After World War I, {{the bulk}} of the High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow. As they were the oldest German dreadnoughts, the Nassau-class ships were for the time {{permitted}} to remain in German ports. After the German fleet was scuttled, Nassau and her three sisters were surrendered to the victorious Allied powers as replacements for the sunken ships. Nassau was ceded to Japan in April 1920. With no <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ship, Japan sold her to a British wrecking firm which then scrapped her in Dordrecht, Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|Another {{well-known}} artefact with {{an astronomical}} use is the Antikythera mechanism. In this case {{analysis of the}} artefact, and reference to the description of similar devices described by Cicero, would indicate a plausible <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> device.

5|$|Before 1914, a cycling track {{ran around}} the {{perimeter}} of the pitch where regular cycling meetings were hosted as well as athletic events. Aside from football-related uses, the stadium has seen various concerts staged along with other sporting events including boxing matches and international rugby league and rugby union matches. In 1999, the last ever final of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup took place at Villa Park. Villa Park also hosted the 2012 FA Community Shield, as Wembley Stadium was in <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> final of the Olympic football tournament.|$|E
5|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik {{was written}} {{at a more}} rapid pace than the band's {{previous}} album. Prior to the Chili Peppers relocation into the mansion, Frusciante and Kiedis collaborated at each other's homes, in order to arrange song structures and guitar riffs. They would then present ideas to Flea and Smith, and the band would, as a whole, decide what they would <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bass, guitar, vocal and percussion ensembles.|$|E

5|$|Curtis {{admitted}} in a 2004 documentary that just before recording began, producer John Lloyd {{came up to}} him with Atkinson and asked what Edmund's character was. Curtis then realised that, despite writing some funny lines, {{he had no idea how}} Rowan Atkinson was supposed to play his part. On the 25th anniversary documentary Blackadder Rides Again, Atkinson added that as the cameras were about to roll for the first time, he suddenly realised he wasn't even sure what voice to <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> character.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the flyoff competition, the XSO2U-1 {{was used}} as a general utility {{aircraft}} and hack by the Navy, before being supplied to the Ranger Engine Corporation in July 1942 for use in tests of the V-770 engine. These tests were intended to assist in debugging the engine for the Bell XP-77 lightweight fighter and Edo XOSE floatplane, but the V-770 remained troublesome, and after two years of testing the XSO2U was returned to the Navy. Having no further <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> aircraft, the XSO2U-1 was removed from the Navy's rolls on 6 July 1944, being subsequently scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Late on 11 July the 5th Guards Tank Army {{prepared}} for its forthcoming counterattack. Leibstandartes advance had disrupted Rotmistrov's preparations, as the assembly areas {{he intended to}} <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> tank army's 18th and 29th Tank Corps were in German hands {{by the end of}} the day, forcing him to hastily revise his plans and select new positions. The arrival of the 5th Guards Tank Army just days earlier was detrimental to it in two major ways: the tank unit commanders did not have an opportunity to reconnoitre the terrain they would be travelling across, and the supporting artillery was unable to site and spot their fire.|$|E

5|$|Paracetamol may be {{quantified}} in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or {{to aid in}} the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30mg/l, which equals 200 µmol/L. Levels of 30–300mg/L (200–2000 µmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50–400mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated colorimetric techniques, gas chromatography and liquid chromatography are currently in <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.|$|E
5|$|Several Muslim {{countries}} {{along the}} south coast of the Mediterranean Sea used a red flag similar to {{the flag of the}} Ottoman Empire. After the destruction of the Tunisian naval division at the Battle of Navarino on 20 October 1827, the sovereign Husainid Dynasty leader Al-Husayn II ibn Mahmud decided to create a flag to <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> fleet of Tunisia, to distinguish it from other fleets. There are some discrepancies over the date of the flag's adoption, as the government states that it was adopted in 1831, while other sources like Siobhan Ryan's Ultimate Pocket Flags of the World claim that it was adopted in 1835.|$|E

5|$|The first {{components}} of the Mulberry harbours were brought across on D+1 and the structures were in use for unloading by mid-June. One was constructed at Arromanches by the British, the other at Omaha by the Americans. Severe storms on 19 June interrupted the landing of supplies and destroyed the Omaha harbour. The repaired Arromanches harbour was able to receive around 6,000 tons of materiel daily and was in continuous <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next ten months, but most shipments were brought in over the beaches until the port of Cherbourg was cleared of mines and obstructions on 16 July.|$|E
5|$|The main <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> agung in Maguindanao and Maranao {{society is}} as a supportive/accompanying {{instrument}} of an orthodox kulintang ensemble. Using basic patterns and interlocking rhythms, a player {{would use the}} agung to complement the melody played by the kulintang. The patterns players use are normally considered freer than either the babendil or the dabakan; players could manipulate the patterns freely {{as long as they}} conform, reaffirm, reinforce and even generate the rhythmic mode of the piece. The length of the patterns themselves may vary depending on how they fit into the melodic improvisation. Rapid style is useful especially during exhibition of playing skills.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} methods of classifying musical instruments. Various methods examine aspects such as the physical properties of the instrument (material, color, shape, etc.), the <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> instrument, {{the means by which}} music is produced with the instrument, the range of the instrument, and the instrument's place in an orchestra or other ensemble. Most methods are specific to a geographic area or cultural group and were developed to serve the unique classification requirements of the group. The problem with these specialized classification schemes is that they tend to break down once they are applied outside of their original area. For example, a system based on instrument use would fail if a culture invented a new <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> same instrument. Scholars recognize Hornbostel-Sachs as the only system that applies to any culture and, more important, provides only possible classification for each instrument. The most common types of instrument classifications are strings, brass, woodwind, and percussion.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce {{had planned}} to {{introduce}} a motion giving notice that he would bring forward a bill for the Abolition of the Slave Trade during the 1789 parliamentary session.

It was several months before {{he was able to}} resume work, and he spent time convalescing at Bath and Cambridge. His regular bouts of gastrointestinal illnesses precipitated the use of moderate quantities of opium, which proved effective in alleviating his condition, and which he continued to <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of his life.|$|E
