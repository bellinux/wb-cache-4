2500|$|The wreck was {{discovered}} {{at a depth}} of [...] by the Finnish Navy in 2005. It was in a perfect state and laid <b>upright</b> on the <b>sea</b> floor. Even a part of one of the 3 masts was still standing and some cannons were still in position on the wooden deck. The wreck is so well preserved because of the environment with mainly the low salinity, cold temperatures and little oxygen in the water at this depth playing a part in making sure the wooden hull of the ship stayed in good condition.|$|R
5000|$|Deployment phase: The {{instrument}} package is {{dropped to the}} sea floor. The principal components of the package are the anchor weight which allows the assembly to sink and then remain firmly on the sea floor, the acoustic release device which can receive a remote commands from the control station to drop the anchor weight, the instrument or payload {{which is to be}} deployed and later recovered, and a flotation device which keeps the assembly <b>upright</b> on the <b>sea</b> floor, {{and at the end of}} the deployment allows it to return to the surface.|$|R
5000|$|In 1947 she {{was sold}} to Cie. Maritime Belge CMB, Lloyd Royal S. A., of Antwerp, Netherlands and renamed the SS Mahenge used as a Belgian cargo ship. On June 30, 1952 she {{collided}} in fog with the SS Grandville off Alderney, of the Channel Islands, in the English Channel. The collision caused a cargo explosion in the Mahenge. She sank at 49.48N 02.18W, 15 miles North of Jersey island and 12 miles east of Guernsey island. In 2007 drivers found her stands <b>upright</b> on the <b>sea</b> floor with a slight list to port with the derricks cranes still intact.|$|R

5000|$|After {{a week of}} diving, Steve, Chris, and Adrian {{discover}} a sunken 17th century pirate's ship, standing <b>upright</b> on the <b>sea</b> floor, with a large treasure chest sitting on its deck. When they resurface and report this to Bruno, Bruno instructs his three friends remain with the Arctic Tern. Then he dons his scuba gear, plunges into the water, and swims toward the ship. A large octopus with fiery eyes guards the treasure chest on the deck. Bruno wrestles with the octopus, kills it, and touches the silver coins in the chest. Immediately, Morgan’s pirate ship crumbles to dust. Then Bruno, the treasure chest, and the Arctic Tern vanish.|$|R
50|$|Miller's Point {{has become}} a popular {{launching}} site for wreck diving trips, as well as dives on the nearby reefs. Two frigates, two fishing boats and an offshore mining vessel were scuttled in Smitswinkel Bay by the Navy in the early 1970s, to form an artificial reef which {{has proved to be}} a success. These ships now sit <b>upright</b> on the <b>sea</b> bed, about 4 km from the launching point. In addition, the SAS Pietermaritzburg, formerly HMS Pelorus (which led the D-Day invasions of Normandy) was scuttled in shallow water (20m) just off Miller's Point and the Portuguese liner Lusitania (which lies in deeper water at Bellows Rock near Cape Point after running aground there in 1911) is also most conveniently accessible from Miller's Point launches.|$|R
5000|$|On December 15, 2002 a {{group of}} divers {{operating}} off the dive vessel MV Empress located the wreck of Itsukushima north east of Bawean Island in the Java Sea. [...] At the time of discovery the wreck lay in two sections, cleanly severed where Zwaardvisch's torpedo struck aft. The much larger forward section rests 350 to 400 meters from the severed stern and is completely upside down from the bow stem to the break where the three propeller shafts begin to exit the hull. No upper-works or superstructure what-so-ever can be seen. The small severed stern section sits upright and is relatively intact. The deck is deteriorated with the 'doors' on the two outer mine laying ‘wings’ closed and in place. The 'doors' across the stern itself are missing. No 5.5-inch guns {{can be seen on}} the aft section, but one gun mount sits <b>upright</b> on the <b>seabed</b> about 15 meters from the break in the hull.|$|R

Commander Shane Moore, the officer responsible for the Royal Australian Navy's heritage collection, confirmed that the wreck was M-24 after viewing footage from multiple dives, along with measurements the group had taken. The wreck had several bullet holes in it, most likely from Chicagos quadruple machine-gun mount. The location of the wreck was kept secret by both the divers and the navy, with Defence Minister Brendan Nelson promising to have the wreck protected as a war grave. The wreck was gazetted on 1 December 2006 as a heritage site. A [...] exclusion zone was established around the wreck site, and any vessel entering the zone is {{liable to a fine}} under New South Wales law of up to A$1.1 million, with additional fines and confiscation of equipment under Commonwealth law.

500|$|The wreck lies at a {{depth of}} [...] In 2002, the first survey of the wreck was done by a team led by James P. Delgado for the Sea Hunters {{documentary}} produced by the National Underwater and Marine Agency. The team included the archaeologist Dr. Willi Kramer, the first German to visit the wreck since she sank 88 years before. Dresden lies on her starboard side pointed north, toward the beach. The wreck is heavily damaged; much of the upper works, including the bridge, the masts, the funnels, and many of the guns have been torn from the ship. The bow has been cut off by the scuttling charges detonated by the ship's crew, and sits <b>upright</b> on the <b>sea</b> floor. The stern is also badly damaged, with the main deck blasted away and many shell holes in the ship's side. Some of the damage to the aft of the ship appears to have been done by an undocumented salvage operation before Delgado's survey. According to German records, Dresden was carrying gold coins from their colony at Tsingtau; Delgado speculated that this salvage work was an attempt to retrieve these.|$|R
60|$|Soon {{the ponies}} {{attacked}} the swelling moor road with striving forelegs. Mrs. Durrant let the reins fall slackly, and leant backwards. Her vivacity had left her. Her hawk nose was {{thin as a}} bleached bone through which you almost see the light. Her hands, lying on the reins in her lap, were firm even in repose. The upper lip was cut so short that it raised itself almost in a sneer from the front teeth. Her mind skimmed leagues where Mrs. Pascoe's mind adhered to its solitary patch. Her mind skimmed leagues as the ponies climbed the hill road. Forwards and backwards she cast her mind, as if the roofless cottages, mounds of slag, and cottage gardens overgrown with foxglove and bramble cast shade upon her mind. Arrived at the summit, she stopped the carriage. The pale hills were round her, each scattered with ancient stones; beneath was the sea, variable as a southern sea; she herself sat there looking from hill to <b>sea,</b> <b>upright,</b> aquiline, equally poised between gloom and laughter. Suddenly she flicked the ponies so that the boy Curnow had to swing himself up by {{the toe of his}} boot.|$|R

60|$|When I {{did look}} up to try to {{photograph}} the next leap of the swordfish I saw him, close at hand, monstrous and animated, in a surging, up-sweeping splash. I heard the hiss of the boiling foam. He lunged away, churning the water like a sudden whirl of a ferryboat wheel, {{and then he turned}} squarely at us. Even then Captain Dan's yell did not warn us. I felt rather than saw that he had put on full speed ahead. The swordfish dove toward us, went under, came up in a two-sheeted white splash, and rose high and higher, to fall with a cracking sound. Like a flash of light he shot up again, and began wagging his huge purple-barred body, lifting himself still higher, until all but his tail stood ponderously above the surface; and then, incredibly powerful, he wagged and lashed <b>upright</b> in a <b>sea</b> of hissing foam, mouth open wide, blood streaming down his wet sides and flying in red spray from his slapping gills--a wonderful and hair-raising spectacle. He stayed up only what seemed a moment. During this action and when he began again to leap and smash toward us, I snapped my camera three times upon him. But I missed seeing some of his greatest leaps because I had to look at the camera while operating it.|$|R
60|$|The light-house keeper {{said that}} when the wind blowed strong on to the shore, the waves ate fast into the bank, but when it blowed off they took no sand away; for in the former case the wind heaped up {{the surface of the}} water next to the beach, and to {{preserve}} its equilibrium a strong undertow immediately set back again into the sea which carried with it the sand and whatever else was in the way, and left the beach hard to walk on; but in the latter case the undertow set on and carried the sand with it, so that it was particularly difficult for shipwrecked men to get to land when the wind blowed on to the shore, but easier when it blowed off. This undertow, meeting the next surface wave on the bar which itself has made, forms part of the dam over which the latter breaks, as over an <b>upright</b> wall. The <b>sea</b> thus plays with the land holding a sand-bar in its mouth awhile before it swallows it, as a cat plays with a mouse; but the fatal gripe is sure to come at last. The sea sends its rapacious east wind to rob the land, but before the former has got far with its prey, the land sends its honest west wind to recover some of its own. But, according to Lieutenant Davis, the forms, extent, and distribution of sand-bars and banks are principally determined, not by winds and waves but by tides.|$|R
5|$|Raising the Mary Rose meant {{overcoming}} {{a number}} of delicate problems {{that had never been}} encountered before. The raising of the Swedish warship Vasa 1959–61 was the only comparable precedent, but it had been a relatively straightforward operation since the hull was completely intact and rested <b>upright</b> on the <b>seabed.</b> It had been raised with basically the same methods as were in use in Tudor England: cables were slung under the hull and attached to two pontoons {{on either side of the}} ship which was then gradually raised and towed into shallower waters. Only one third of the Mary Rose was intact and she lay deeply embedded in mud. If the hull were raised in the traditional way, there was no guarantee that it would have enough structural strength to hold together out of water. Many suggestions for raising the ship were discarded, including the construction of a cofferdam around the wreck site, filling the ship with small buoyant objects (such as ping pong balls) or even pumping brine into the seabed and freezing it so that it would float and take the hull with it. After lengthy discussions it was decided in February 1980 that the hull would first be emptied of all its contents and strengthened with steel braces and frames. It would then be lifted to the surface with floating sheerlegs attached to nylon strops passing under the hull and transferred to a cradle. It was also decided that the ship would be recovered before the end of the diving season in 1982. If the wreck stayed uncovered any longer it risked irreversible damage from biological decay and tidal scouring.|$|R
