50|$|The {{final plan}} {{was created to}} meet both {{political}} and strategic objectives, and its success depended on two crucial factors: predicting the possible Indian axis of advance correctly, {{and the ability of}} the Pakistani troops to fall back to their designated areas in the face of Indian air superiority and Mukti Bahini activity. The Pakistani Eastern Command was fighting a holding action cut off from reinforcements and without any reserves to counter <b>unforeseen</b> <b>developments,</b> and its ultimate success lay in Pakistan defeating India in the west. If any of the factors deviated from the assumed norm of the plan, the Eastern Command was without the resources to win on its own. The Pakistani army had been fighting the insurgency nonstop for eight months and was severely fatigued and short of supplies; in addition, the deployment near the border had robbed them of the manoeuvrability needed for a flexible defence.|$|E

5000|$|After {{setting the}} goals {{marketing}} strategy or marketing plan should be developed. This is {{an explanation of}} what specific actions will be taken over time to achieve the objectives. Plans can be extended to cover many years, with sub-plans for each year. Although, as the speed {{of change in the}} merchandising environment quickens, time horizons are becoming shorter. Ideally, strategies are both dynamic and interactive, partially planned and partially unplanned. To enable a firm to react to <b>unforeseen</b> <b>developments</b> while trying to keep focused on a specific pathway, a longer time frame is preferred. There are simulations such as customer lifetime value models which can help marketers conduct [...] "what-if" [...] analyses to forecast what might happen based on possible actions, and gauge how specific actions might affect such variables as the revenue-per-customer and the churn rate. Strategies often specify how to adjust the marketing mix; firms can use tools such as Marketing Mix Modeling to help them decide how to allocate scarce resources for different media, as well as how to allocate funds across a portfolio of brands. In addition, firms can conduct analyses of performance, customer analysis, competitor analysis, and target market analysis. A key aspect of marketing strategy is often to keep marketing consistent with a company's overarching mission statement.|$|E

That lavish film had included Technicolor sequences and had been a success. Unfortunately, delays in beginning the actual filming of King of Jazz caused its release to occur after two <b>unforeseen</b> <b>developments.</b> First, the public had tired of the flood of movie musicals that began as a slow trickle with The Jazz Singer in late 1927 and rapidly became a torrent after the success of The Broadway Melody in early 1929. In particular disfavor were operettas set in bygone eras, musical-comedies which were unimaginatively filmed Broadway stage productions, and plotless [...] "revues" [...] such as King of Jazz. Second, although the ripple effects from {{the stock market crash}} in October 1929 had not yet produced the full-blown depression which would soon be painfully obvious, people were already spending less freely and the effects were starting to be felt at the box-office. During its national release, King of Jazz cleared less than $900,000. Around Hollywood, the movie came to be called [...] "Universal's Rhapsody in the Red". Because of poor box-office receipts for the film and the cancellation of his lucrative nationally-broadcast radio program by its sponsor in April 1930, Whiteman had to let ten bandmembers go and cut the salaries of the remaining bandmembers by fifteen percent.|$|E

The author seeks to answer questions such as whether the requirement (i. e., <b>unforeseen</b> <b>developments</b> must be demonstrated in order for safeguard measures to be justified) {{is an integral part}} of the Agreement on Safeguards, and how the subjectivity associated with this requirement contributes to the difficulty of constructing a reasoned and adequate account of the causal chain. The article also includes within its scope a brief analysis of larger issues such as the political and economic rationale behind safeguard measures, and how ambiguities in the Agreement on Safeguards can destabilize the discipline of safeguards and defeat one of its major purposes - to help countries nurture their infant industries. Finally, the article reflects upon how India, being one of the leading users of safeguard measures as of 2008, is likely to be affected by unclear areas in the present legislation such as the <b>unforeseen</b> <b>developments</b> clause.

The Pentagon deployed eight minesweeping Sea Stallion helicopters, five oceangoing minesweepers, and six small coastal minesweepers—dramatically increasing U.S. presence in the Persian Gulf, and increasing the probability of an Iran-U.S. confrontation. U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger indirectly provoked Iran to retaliate.|$|R

The impacts that these technology-enhanced environments may have on student perceptions of transactional distance and tele-/copresence are explored.

As regards many key parameters the climate system is already moving beyond the patterns of natural vari-ability within which our society and economy have developed and thrived. Inaction is inexcusable (International Scientifi c Congress on Climate Change: Key Messages, 2009). But why then is it so diffi cult to agree on strategies to improve these problems. In any event, the two problems are interrelated since both economic crisis and pollution are the outcomes of similar factors. Both problems have been exposed by globalisation.

In the 1950s, {{the need for a}} longer set of runways in order to {{accommodate}} the larger aircraft on the air travel horizon was clear. With no ability to expand CYXD, the search was on for a new airport site. Because of the existing military base at Namao (now CFB Edmonton), just north of the city, built by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) in World War II and expanded to handle SAC (Strategic Air Command) military bomber aircraft in the 1950s with the longest runway in Canada, the current site for the Edmonton International Airport (CYEG) was chosen at Leduc, [...] south southwest of downtown Edmonton. Upon completion of a new passenger terminal at CYEG in 1963, CYXD was to be closed. However, after being examined by consultants, and with the <b>unforeseen</b> <b>development</b> of possible regional airliner service, especially to Calgary, it was decided by the City of Edmonton to keep CYXD open and operate it in tandem with CYEG. Edmonton then entered into a 50-year airport debate concerning CYXD that shaped logistics, transportation, and regional disparity issues.|$|R

With this change there have also occurred variations in the pattern of homicide by both sexes and of all ages in England and Wales, particularly since the introduction of the Homicide Act in 1957 as shown in the Figure and a growth in murders committed by children as shown in the Table. Abolition of the death penalty Before the abolition of the death penalty for homicide the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 defined 18 years as the minimum age for execution, the last teenager to be hanged being "Flossie " Forsythe in 1960 at the age of 18. Prior to 1966 a murderer could "hang by the neck until dead " and due to this courts were more ready to allow a culprit to be termed "insane". Since then the number of "insane " murderers of both sexes and all ages has fallen from four times the figure for those classed as "normal " or "sane " to a nearly equal number as shown in the Figure.
