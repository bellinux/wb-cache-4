A <b>user</b> <b>macro</b> {{was created in}} APDL programming language for estimation of crack propagation direction and collection of data. Macro allows selection {{one of the four}} criteria intended to estimate the direction of the crack and the subsequent listing of the data into a text document. The calculation is based on the finite element method (FEM) using a commercial system ANSYS. The conditions of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) are expected during the calculation. The first part of this thesis describes the basic concepts of LEFM, including a description of mentioned criteria. The second part is devoted to the created macro. It also describes the algorithm and the necessary conditions for correct processing of data. A comparison with available published data or with experimental data gives a summary of the accuracy and utilization of created macro. In conclusion, the example of estimation of the residual life by different criteria is shown, as its other application...|$|E
40|$|The JPL Supervisory Telerobotics (STELER) Laboratory has {{developed}} and demonstrated a unique local-remote robot control architecture which enables management of intermittent communication bus latencies and delays {{such as those}} expected for ground-remote operation of Space Station robotic systems via the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) communication platform. The current work at JPL in this area has focused on enhancing the technologies and transferring the control architecture to hardware and software environments which are more compatible with projected ground and space operational environments. At the local site, the operator updates the remote worksite model using stereo video and a model overlay/fitting algorithm which outputs the location and orientation of the object in free space. That information is relayed to the robot <b>User</b> <b>Macro</b> Interface (UMI) to enable programming of the robot control macros. This capability runs on a single Silicon Graphics Inc. machine. The operator can employ either manual teleoperation, shared control, or supervised autonomous control to manipulate the intended object. The remote site controller, called the Modular Telerobot Task Execution System (MOTES), runs in a multi-processor VME environment and performs the task sequencing, task execution, trajectory generation, closed loop force/torque control, task parameter monitoring, and reflex action. This paper describes the new STELER architecture implementation, and also documents {{the results of the}} recent autonomous docking task execution using the local site and MOTES...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} about {{creating}} an annotated SAS/GRAPH plot of z/OS ® local page dataset slot utilization. The z/OS local page dataset slots {{are used by}} z/OS for management of system memory. The annotated plot shows the count of the local page slots defined {{and the number of}} slots that are used. A red star highlights the maximum local slot usage. Through the day, slots are used and released with copies of main memory information. For z/OS performance reasons the MXG slot utilization guideline is at or below 25 %. At higher utilizations, z/OS response times can degrade. And an extreme local page slot shortage could even cause the z/OS server to crash. The data for the SAS/GRAPH plot is from the z/OS Resource Measurement Facility record type 71. The MXG performance database (PDB) stores this record information in SAS format in the PDB. TYPE 71 dataset. By plotting the daily local page slot usage our z/OS system support personnel are able easily verify that no shortage exists or to research potential problems that could contribute to a shortage. Such problems could be, insufficient central storage, or not allocating enough local page datasets with sufficient slots, or perhaps an unusual condition that never released unused slots. Each problem condition may require a different technical response to resolve the problem and to prevent a system outage. SAS and SAS/GRAPH help in daily z/OS monitoring to prevent any z/OS outage from a lack of local page slots. This paper specifically details annotating z/OS RMF data in the MXG PDB.

40|$|A {{hardware}} and software environment for shared control of telerobot task execution has been implemented. Modes of task execution range from fully teleoperated to fully autonomous as well as shared where hand controller inputs from the human operator are mixed with autonomous system inputs in real time. The objective of the shared control environment is to aid the telerobot operator during task execution by merging real-time operator control from hand controllers with autonomous control to simplify task execution for the operator. The operator is the principal command source and can assign as much autonomy for a task as desired. The shared control hardware environment consists of two PUMA 560 robots, two 6 -axis force reflecting hand controllers, Universal Motor Controllers {{for each of the}} robots and hand controllers, a SUN 4 computer, and VME chassis containing 68020 processors and input/output boards. The operator interface for shared control, the <b>User</b> <b>Macro</b> Interface (UMI), is a menu driven interface to design a task and assign the levels of teleoperated and autonomous control. The operator also sets up the system monitor which checks safety limits during task execution. Cartesian-space degrees of freedom for teleoperated and/or autonomous control inputs are selected within UMI as well as the weightings for the teleoperation and autonmous inputs. These are then used during task execution to determine the mix of teleoperation and autonomous inputs. Some of the autonomous control primitives available to the user are Joint-Guarded-Move, Cartesian-Guarded-Move, Move-To-Touch, Pin-Insertion/Removal, Door/Crank-Turn, Bolt-Turn, and Slide. The operator can execute a task using pure teleoperation or mix control execution from the autonomous primitives with teleoperated inputs. Presently the shared control environment supports single arm task execution. Work is presently underway to provide the shared control environment for dual arm control. Teleoperation during shared control is only Cartesian space control and no force-reflection is provided. Force-reflecting teleoperation and joint space operator inputs are planned extensions to the environment...|$|E

Indeed, how to make each user access the appropriate network substantially affects the network performance [5].

30|$|Nevertheless, the {{drawback}} of FRP {{scheme is}} {{the sacrifice of}} the spectral efficiency of <b>macro</b> <b>users.</b> Hence, the work [16] presents an evolved FRP scheme, wherein a certain fraction of frequency resources is allocated to not only offloaded <b>macro</b> <b>users</b> with full transmit power but also <b>macro</b> <b>users</b> with lower transmit power. By means of the transmit power reduction in macro tier, the spectral efficiency of <b>macro</b> <b>users</b> is guaranteed. However, the transmit power reduction is randomly applied to <b>macro</b> <b>users,</b> which probably leads to that the performance of <b>macro</b> <b>users</b> in poor situation gets worse. In addition, the small cell edge users also are vulnerable to interfered by the nearby macro BSs. Similar to the RPS, a novel soft frequency reuse (SFR) scheme proposed by [17, 18, 20] can mitigate the strong cross-tier interference by means of joint resource partitioning and transmit power reduction for <b>macro</b> interior <b>users.</b> The strong cross-tier interference suffered by offloaded <b>macro</b> <b>users</b> and pico edge users is commonly mitigated. More recently, the work [17] presents the spectral efficiency analysis for the proposed SFR scheme based on stochastic geometry.

40|$|Employing multi-tier {{networks}} {{is among}} the most promising approaches to address the rapid growth of the data demand in cellular networks. In this paper, we study a two-tier uplink cellular network consisting of femtocells and a macrocell. Femto base stations, and femto and <b>macro</b> <b>users</b> are assumed to be spatially deployed based on independent Poisson point processes. We consider an open access assignment policy, where each <b>macro</b> <b>user</b> based on the ratio between its distances from its nearest femto access point (FAP) and from the macro base station (MBS) is assigned to either of them. By tuning the threshold, this policy allows controlling the coverage areas of FAPs. For a fixed threshold, femtocells coverage areas depend on their distances from the MBS; Those closest to the fringes will have the largest coverage areas. Under this open-access policy, ignoring the additive noise, we derive analytical upper and lower bounds on the outage probabilities of femto <b>users</b> and <b>macro</b> <b>users</b> that are subject to fading and path loss.

30|$|As {{interferences}} {{are experienced}} at receivers, we centered the macro exclusion regions around the <b>macro</b> <b>users.</b> The femto-BSs inside these areas {{may be able}} to detect the macro signals and cease their transmissions. The exclusion regions are usually chosen to be centered at the location of the macro-BSs not the macro receivers based on the argument that it is easier to detect the macro-BSs than the macro receivers especially if the receivers are passive like TV receivers. However, if the <b>macro</b> receivers (<b>users)</b> can be localized, e.g., based on pilot signals or transmitted acknowledgments, our obtained results directly apply and the exclusion regions around <b>macro</b> <b>users</b> can make sense. If the <b>macro</b> <b>users</b> cannot be localized, the exclusion regions have to be formed around the macro-BSs. This scenario can be evaluated with slight changes in the proposed model.

40|$|Abstract—As {{cellular}} {{operators are}} suffering from a data explosion problem, and users are consequently experiencing poor data services, the introduction of femtocells offers a cost-effective way to mitigate this problem. Femtocells enable larger network ca-pacity by increasing spatial reuse of the spectrum and shortening {{the distance to the}} users. Existing work has shown that open access femtocells, which allow unregistered <b>macro</b> <b>users</b> to connect, are efficient in reducing inter-cell interference and offloading traffic. However, a major obstacle constraining the potential capability of femtocells and open access is the lack of incentives for privately-owned femtocells to serve unregistered users. Hence in this paper, we propose a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction based incentive framework for accessing such selfish femtocells. We consider two scenarios: One scenario involves a single <b>macro</b> <b>user</b> and another scenario has multiple <b>macro</b> <b>users.</b> We design auction schemes for both scenarios and show analytically that our schemes are truthful and have low computational complexity. Extensive simulations validate these properties and show huge performance improvement to the <b>macro</b> <b>users.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, we {{consider}} the problem of interference management in heterogeneous networks {{which is one of}} the main features proposed in long term evolution advanced (LTE-Advanced) communications standard. The network architecture of heterogeneous network consists of a main cell coexisting with different types of smaller cells. Heterogeneous networks are one cost effective way of handling the unrelenting data traffic demand. The major technical challenge associated with this type of network architecture is the interference experienced between coexisting cells. Interference can be either between similar type of cells or between different types of cells within the network area. In this thesis, {{we consider}} a heterogeneous network with a macro cell coexisting with a femto cell. The interference between the cells will lower system performance and eventually result in poor <b>macro</b> <b>user</b> experience. Among the various enhanced intercell interference coordination (eICIC) techniques proposed in the third generation partnership project (3 GPP), we focus on power control and time domain schemes using almost blank subframes (ABS). However,these interference management schemes reduce the throughput of femto cell users. This necessitates the need to optimize the resources of power and ABS transmission so that interference experienced by <b>macro</b> <b>user</b> is low and throughput of femto user is high simultaneously. Hence, we consider a joint optimization problem to find the optimal value of power and number of ABS transmission required at the femto cell. In previous work, these optimal parameters were obtained for a system with a macro base station (MBS) serving only one <b>macro</b> <b>user</b> in downlink. We extend the analysis to determine optimal parameters when MBS serves multiple <b>macro</b> <b>users.</b> Specifically, we show that the optimal parameters of power and number of ABS transmissions obtained for the <b>macro</b> <b>user</b> closest to the femto base station (FBS) guarantees maximum throughput for the femto user and minimal interference for all other <b>macro</b> <b>users...</b>|$|R
