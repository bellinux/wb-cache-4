25|$|Operation Phiboonpol {{had ended}} in an indecisive standoff, despite heavy Communist casualties. Military Region 4's (MR 4) Commanding Officer General Phasouk Somly was {{hesitant}} to try another attack {{because of the}} poor fighting qualities of his troops. However, on 1 July 1971, King Sisavang Vatthana paid a royal visit to Pakse and demanded another offensive. Thus it was that Pakse Unit of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) planned an offensive into communist territory on the eastern Bolovens Plateau designed to block one of the supply arteries of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, Route 23. It would also retake two airstrips while occupying the Bolovens Plateau. The plan was for a two phase operation involving not just troops from Pakse's (MR 4), but also from adjoining Military Region 3 (MR 3). As projected, the Royalist force of 11 battalions numbered 4,000 strong; the opposing three Communist battalions could muster barely 1,100 troops. In phase one, MR 3's guerrillas would be airlifted to capture the Pakse 47 airfield southwest of Salavan at <b>UTM</b> <b>coordinates</b> XC5237. Phase two would be a squeeze play; a mobile force would be airlifted to a position northwest of Paksong, while a column probed eastward toward it along Route 23. The Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF) would supply close air support {{at the rate of}} two AC-47 and 35 T-28 sorties daily. Belatedly, the planners realized that RLAF support would be insufficient. Three days before the operation's scheduled start, they requested and received a commitment for 12 daily sorties of tactical air for the next month. The U.S. Air Force (USAF) would fly interdiction strikes on the communist lines of communication with fighter-bombers by day and gunships by night. However, USAF support would not be on a dedicated basis; instead it would be diverted as needed. Logistical air support would come from USAF helicopters, RLAF transports, and Air America under contract. Not taken into account {{was the fact that the}} Royalist columns were not mutually supportive. General Minh, commander of the PAVN battalions, would use this flaw to defeat the Royalists in detail by using his interior lines of communication.|$|E

50|$|Georeferencing {{means that}} the {{internal}} coordinate system of a map or aerial photo image {{can be related to}} a ground system of geographic coordinates. The relevant coordinate transforms are typically stored within the image file (GeoPDF and GeoTIFF are examples), though there are many possible mechanisms for implementing georeferencing. The most visible effect of georeferencing is that display software can show ground coordinates (such as latitude/longitude or <b>UTM</b> <b>coordinates)</b> and also measure ground distances and areas. Doing these things with USGS GeoPDF maps requires the free TerraGo toolbar extension to Adobe Reader. In other words, Georeferencing means to associate something with locations in physical space. The term is commonly used in the geographic information systems field to describe the process of associating a physical map or raster image of a map with spatial locations. Georeferencing may be applied to any kind of object or structure that can be related to a geographical location, such as points of interest, roads, places, bridges, or buildings.|$|E

40|$|Uses of high spatial {{resolution}} {{data obtained from}} satellite-based sensors include creating land cover maps, deriving large-scale quantitative assessments such as vegetation indices, and visually assessing an area for qualitative information only assessable from large-scale digital data. One {{of the more popular}} uses of high {{spatial resolution}} data is to use the image as a base map for on-screen digitizing spatially dependent vector products. Since most geographic information system (GIS) databases store a variety of current and historical data, the accuracy of any on-screen digitized product is dependent on the spatial accuracy of the reference data. Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} and validate the accuracy of data used to create spatially referenced product, even though the data come with high spatial resolution. One of the more popular and historical high spatial resolution data within most GIS labs is QuickBird’s multispectral data at 2. 44 × 2. 44 m 2. Although there are current sensors available with a higher spatial resolution, the sometimes prohibitive expense of obtaining high spatial resolution data necessitates the need to utilize and assess historic data. Since the QuickBird has been the mainstay of high spatial resolution data since 2001, understanding the geometric accuracy of the DigitalGlobe’s QuickBird user-defined panchromatic and multispectral image bundle product remains relevant. In this study, we assessed the positional accuracy of this product for its utility as an “off the shelf” base map for creating other spatially referenced products. The average Euclidean distance, RMSE (root mean square error), and RSME (root square mean error) between QuickBird-identified Universal Transverse Mercator (<b>UTM)</b> <b>coordinates</b> and coincident in situ GPS-collected <b>UTM</b> <b>coordinates</b> were calculated at 33 systematically selected locations throughout the city of Nacogdoches, Texas, USA.
