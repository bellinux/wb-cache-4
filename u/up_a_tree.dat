5|$|While {{hunting the}} boar, Michael is wounded {{by one of}} the animals. Kate starts leading Michael back to the beach, while Locke goes on his own into the jungle. As Kate and Michael head back, she climbs <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> to attach the antenna. However, before she can finish, she hears the sounds of the monster, causing her to drop and break the equipment. The Monster heads {{straight}} for Locke, who stares straight at it.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Sasha {{leaves a}} pigeon at the ShadowClan border {{to prove to}} Tigerstar that kittypets can hunt. After {{catching}} a rabbit, Sasha is attacked by two foxes. Before she can escape, though, Tigerstar comes and attacks the duo of animals, telling her to run. Scrambling <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> Sasha sees that the foxes have an advantage over him, and she jumps down to assist him. After defeating both foxes, Tigerstar stays in her den for the night and lets his wounds heal, and tells Sasha that he came to thank her for the pigeon, and that she is unlike any housecat he has ever known.|$|E
5|$|The jaguar is a stalk-and-ambush {{rather than}} a chase predator. The cat will walk slowly down forest paths, {{listening}} for and stalking prey before rushing or ambushing. The jaguar attacks from cover and usually from a target's blind spot with a quick pounce; the species' ambushing abilities are considered nearly peerless in the animal kingdom by both indigenous people and field researchers, and are probably a product of its role as an apex predator in several different environments. The ambush may include leaping into water after prey, as a jaguar is quite capable of carrying a large kill while swimming; its strength is such that carcasses {{as large as a}} heifer can be hauled <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> to avoid flood levels.|$|E

5|$|Woodpeckers, piculets and wrynecks all possess {{characteristic}} zygodactyl feet, {{consisting of}} four toes, the first (hallux) {{and the fourth}} facing backward and {{the second and third}} facing forward. This foot arrangement is good for grasping the limbs and trunks of trees. Members of this family can walk vertically <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> trunk, which is beneficial for activities such as foraging for food or nest excavation. In addition to their strong claws and feet, woodpeckers have short, strong legs. This is typical of birds that regularly forage on trunks. Exceptions are the black-backed woodpecker and the American and Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers, which have only three toes on each foot. The tails of all woodpeckers, except the piculets and wrynecks, are stiffened, and when the bird perches on a vertical surface, the tail and feet work together to support it.|$|E

After an hour's struggle, he was reportedly dragged <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> but then rescued by police and villagers after {{he was able to}} call for help on his mobile phone. The snake was reportedly captured by police, but had escaped and disappeared by the next day. The man said he bit the snake's tail while he was being attacked and was injured on his lower lip because the tip of the tail was sharp.|$|E

25|$|Bouré's child recalls in {{some aspects}} the Apollo Sauroctonos ("Apollo the Lizard-Slayer"), an often-reproduced figure in {{classical}} antiquity of the pubescent god observing a lizard as it climbs <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree.</b> The original bronze was attributed to the Athenian sculptor Praxiteles. The Louvre acquired a white marble version in 1807. The sculpture received attention in French-language books on art published while Bouré was active, including Émile Gebhart's Praxitèle (1864) and Wilhelm Fröhner's Notice de la sculpture antique du Musée Impérial du Louvre (1878). If {{an image of the}} Sauroctonos is rotated and flipped horizontally, the compositional resemblances with Bouré's L'enfant au lézard become more evident. The Apollo's overall height of nearly 5 feet, which includes the tree trunk extending past the body, gives the figure a vertical proportion comparable to that of Bouré's 4-foot horizontal boy.|$|E
25|$|Secondary hemiepiphytes start life on {{the ground}} or on part of a tree trunk very close to the ground, where the seeds sprout. These philodendrons have their roots in the ground early in their lives. They then begin {{climbing}} <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> and eventually may become completely epithytic, doing away with their subterranean roots. Secondary hemiepiphytes do not always start their lives close to a tree. For these philodendrons, the plant will grow with long internodes along the ground until a tree is found. They find a suitable tree by growing towards darker areas, such as the dark shadow of a tree. This trait is called scototropism. After a tree has been found, the scototropic behavior stops and the philodendron switches to a phototropic growth habit and the internodes shorten and thicken. Usually, however, philodendrons germinate on trees.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the Games, Katniss ignores Haymitch's advice and grabs {{supplies}} placed around the Cornucopia, a structure at the starting point, and narrowly escapes death twice. Twelve tributes die in the initial melee, and only eleven, including the Careers, remain after the first day. Katniss tries {{to stay away from the}} others, but Head Gamemaker Seneca Crane triggers a forest fire to drive her towards them. She runs into the Careers, with whom Peeta has seemingly allied, and flees <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree.</b> Peeta advises the Careers to wait her out. The next morning, Katniss notices Rue, District 11's young female tribute, hiding in an adjacent tree. Rue draws her attention to a nest of tracker jackers, genetically modified poisonous wasps. Katniss cuts the branch holding the nest despite being stung; it falls on the sleeping Careers. Peeta, Marvel, Cato, and Clove escape, but Glimmer succumbs to the venom. Disoriented, Katniss flees from the site.|$|E

25|$|Tigers will {{occasionally}} prey {{on black}} bears. Russian hunters may occasionally find black bear carcasses showing evidence of tiger predation, and their remains may occur in tiger scats. If {{they manage to}} escape a tiger, black bears will attempt to rush <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> {{and wait for the}} tiger to leave, though some tigers will pretend to leave, and wait for the bear to descend. One Manchurian tiger was reported to have lured an Asiatic black bear by imitating the species' mating call. Tigers regularly prey on young bears but adult bears are occasionally taken as well. Black bears are usually safe from tiger attacks once they reach five years of age. Although black bears prefer to avoid tigers, they can be extremely tenacious when attacked: Jim Corbett observed a fight between a tiger and the largest black bear he had ever seen, which resulted in the bear managing to chase off the tiger, despite having half its nose and scalp torn off. However, black bears may be less vulnerable than brown bears to tiger predation, due to their habit of living in hollows or in close set rocks, thus making them harder to pursue. At least one fatal attack on a juvenile bear has been recorded in Jigme Dorji National Park, as Bhutan's tiger populations have begun to colonise higher altitude areas. Black bears may steal tiger kills: Jim Corbett twice saw black bears carry off tiger kills when the latter was absent.|$|E

500|$|Coon {{hunting or}} raccoon hunting is the {{practice}} of hunting raccoons, most often for their meat and fur. It is almost always done with specially bred dogs called coonhounds, {{of which there are}} six breeds, and is most commonly associated with rural life in the Southern United States. Coon hunting is also popular in the rural Midwest. Most coon hunts take place at night, with the dogs being turned loose, trailing and putting the raccoon <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> without human assistance. Once the raccoon is in the tree, with the dog at the base, it is referred to as [...] "treed", with [...] "treeing" [...] being the active verb form.|$|E
500|$|Horton Hatches the Egg was {{published}} by Random House in fall 1940 to immediate success. It received primarily positive notice from critics. Kirkus Reviews called it [...] "sheer nonsense, but good fun." [...] The reviewer for The New York Times Book Review wrote, [...] "A moral is a new thing to find in a Dr. Seuss book, but it doesn't much interfere with the hilarity with which he juggles an elephant <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree.</b> To an adult the tale seems a little forced compared to his first grand yarns, less inevitable in its nonsense, but neither young nor old are going to quibble with the fantastic comedy of his pictures." ...|$|E
500|$|In an aside, {{the narrator}} tells {{the reader that}} the couple had great {{quantities}} of nuts because they never lost them, noting that most squirrels lose half their nuts because they cannot remember where they buried them.

500|$|The Brown {{family was}} later {{described}} as [...] "progressive and ... {{ahead of their}} times", and had innovative ideas about wood products manufacturing and scientific forest management. [...] During Brown's tenure, the company {{was one of the}} first to initiate modern forest management practices and to attempt to conserve the forest for future industry use. He was particularly critical of the damage done by portable sawmills. [...] Brown understood that the pulp mills of his time were dependent on locally accessible timber, and concluded that sustainable practices were important to the industry. He built upon the sustainable forestry practices advocated by company forester Austin Cary, who had been recruited from the U.S. Forest Service. In 1919, Brown set <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> nursery on the north shore of Cupsuptic Lake that researched sustained yield practices and [...] at its peak was the largest tree nursery in the United States.
