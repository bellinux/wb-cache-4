40|$|Abstract—Measurements {{of middle}} ear (ME) {{acoustic}} power flow (power reflectance, power absorption, and transmittance) and normalized impedance (<b>acoustic</b> resistance, <b>acoustic</b> <b>reactance,</b> and impedance magnitude) were compared for their utility in clin-ical applications. Transmittance, {{a measure of}} the acoustic power absorbed by the ME, was found to have several important advan-tages over other measures of acoustic power flow. In addition to its simple and audiologically relevant physical interpretation (absorbed power), the normal transmittance curve has a simple shape that is visually similar to the ME transfer function. The acoustic impedance measures (resistance and reactance) provided important additional information about ME status and supple-mented transmittance measurements. Together these measure-ments can help identify unusual conditions such as eardrum perforations. While this article is largely a review of the develop...|$|R
50|$|<b>Acoustic</b> <b>reactance</b> represents, as well, the {{pressure}} {{that is out of}} phase with the motion and causes no average energy transfer. For example, a closed bulb connected to an organ pipe will have air moving into it and pressure, but they are out of phase so no net energy is transmitted into it. While {{the pressure}} rises, air moves in, and while it falls, it moves out, but the average pressure when the air moves in is the same as that when it moves out, so the power flows back and forth but with no time averaged energy transfer. The electrical analogy for this is a capacitor connected across a power line. Current flows through the capacitor but it is out of phase with the voltage, so no net power is transmitted into it.|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{description of}} sinusoidal oscillation of an incompressible viscoelastic medium between fixed infinite parallel planes is presented. The mechanical {{properties of the}} viscoelastic medium under sinusoidal shear are expressed by a complex viscosity coefficient. The general equation for oscillatory motion of an incompressible viscoelastic medium is developed. The solution to this equation is obtained for rectilinear motion parallel {{to a pair of}} infinite planes. The equation for the velocity distribution between the planes is developed and several typical profiles are presented graphically. The equation for the acoustic impedance per unit area of plane is obtained. Functions from which the acoustic resistance and <b>acoustic</b> <b>reactance</b> may be determined are presented in graphical form for media which range from a perfect viscous fluid to a perfect elastic solid. The applicability of the theoretical results to oscillatory flow in rectangular tubes is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Results from {{impedance}} eduction methods {{developed by}} NASA Langley Research Center are {{used throughout the}} acoustic liner community. In spite of recent enhancements, occasional anomalies persist with these methods, generally at frequencies where the liner produces minimal attenuation. This investigation demonstrates an experimental approach to educe impedance with increased confidence over a desired frequency range, by combining results from successive tests with different cavity depths. A series of tests is conducted with three wire-mesh facesheets, for which the results should be weakly dependent on source sound pressure level and mean grazing flow speed. First, a raylometer is {{used to measure the}} DC flow resistance of each facesheet. These facesheets are then mounted onto a frame and a normal incidence tube is used to determine their respective acoustic impedance spectra. A comparison of the acoustic resistance component with the DC flow resistance for each facesheet is used to validate the measurement process. Next, each facesheet is successively mounted onto three frames with different cavity depths, and a grazing flow impedance tube is used to educe their respective acoustic impedance spectra with and without mean flow. The no-flow results are compared with those measured in the normal incidence tube to validate the impedance eduction method. Since the anti-resonance frequency varies with cavity depth, each sample provides robust results over a different frequency range. Hence, a combination of results can be used to determine the facesheet acoustic resistance. When combined with the <b>acoustic</b> <b>reactance,</b> observed to be weakly dependent on the source sound pressure level and grazing flow Mach number, the acoustic impedance can be educed with increased confidence. Representative results of these tests are discussed, and the complete database is available in electronic format upon request...|$|R

According to Dr. Maa’s theory, the wide-band sound absorption characterization of micro-perforated panel absorber is determined by its high acoustic resistance and low <b>acoustic</b> mass <b>reactance,</b> he also derive its prediction formula in sound absorbing coefficient.

40|$|Acoustic liners {{are used}} in {{turbofan}} engine nacelles for the suppression of engine noise. For a given engine, there are different optimum impedance distributions associated with take-off, cut-back, and approach flight conditions. The impedance of conventional acoustic liners is fixed for a given geometry, and conventional active liner approaches are impractical. This project addresses {{the need for a}} tunable impedance through the development of an electromechanical Helmholtz resonator (EMHR). The device consists of a Helmholtz resonator with the standard rigid backplate replaced by a compliant piezoelectric composite. Analytical models (i. e., a lumped element model (LEM) and a transfer matrix (TM) representation of the EMHR) are developed to predict the acoustic behavior of the EMHR. The EMHR is experimentally investigated using the standard two-microphone method (TMM). The measurement results validate both the LEM and the TM of the EMHR. Good agreement between predicted and measured impedance is obtained. Short- and open-circuit loads define the limits of the tuning range using resistive and capacitive loads. There is approximately a 9 % tuning limit under these conditions for the non-optimized resonator configuration studied. Inductive shunt loads result in a 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) system and an enhanced tuning range of over 47 % that is not restricted by the short- and open-circuit limits. Damping coefficient measurements for a piezoelectric backplate in a vacuum chamber are performed and indicate that the damping is dominated by structural damping losses. A Pareto optimization design based on models of the EMHR is performed with non-inductive loads. The EMHR with non-inductive loads has 2 DOF and two resonant frequencies. The tuning ranges of the two resonant frequencies of the EMHR with non-inductive loads cannot be optimized simultaneously, so a trade-off (Pareto solution) must be reached. The Pareto solution shows how design trade-offs can be used to satisfy specific design requirements. The goal of the optimization of the EMHR with inductive loads is to achieve optimal tuning of the three resonant frequencies. The results indicate {{that it is possible to}} keep the <b>acoustic</b> <b>reactance</b> of the resonator nearly constant within a given frequency range...|$|R
40|$|During burrow digging by {{the mole}} cricket Scapteriscus acletus Rehn and Hubbard, the burrow is {{enlarged}} and shaped {{in a series}} of digging cycles, each lasting 1 — 2 min, and song chirps are produced after every cycle. The song becomes up to 18 dB louder and acoustically purer during burrow building. The shape of the song pulse envelope changes so that its average power density becomes greater and its build-up and decay become more gradual. The forewings show a single resonance of the harp (Cu 1 cell) regions at 2 - 5 — 3 0 kHz: the normal song carrier frequency is 2 - 5 — 2 - 7 kHz. Removal of the outer parts of the forewings does not affect the radiated sound power. The singing burrow has an exponential horn opening at the soil surface and an internal bulb. The calculated cut-off frequency of the horn is 1 - 34 kHz and that of the first resonance is 2 - 5 - 2 - 7 kHz. The volume of the bulb is close to that required to tune the throat: obliteration of the burrow bulb causes a substantial decrease in the radiated sound pressure levels before singing ceases. The horn mouth acts as a finite sound source, with large <b>acoustic</b> <b>reactance.</b> The <b>acoustics</b> of the burrow were measured with a small doublet source inserted at the position at which the cricket sings. At this position, the burrow resonates at 2 - 75 - 3 kHz, with a quality factor (Q), measured both by the — 3 dB bandwidth and by the build-up and decay of tone bursts, of 2 - 5 - 2 - 7. The sound pressure produced by the doublet source is up to 24 dB louder when it is in the burrow than when it is in free air. Further in or out from the insect's singing position, the effective gain of the burrow is reduced and other resonances and anti-resonances are observed. Obliteration of the burrow bulb reduces the effective gain of the burrow by 6 — 10 dB and the burrow ceases to resonate at 2 - 75 kHz. It is proposed that the tuned burrow acts as a resistive load on the vibrating harps, so allowing good coupling between the small wings and the surrounding medium while allowing a pure carrier frequency to be radiated...|$|R
