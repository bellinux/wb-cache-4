As of this writing the exhibition is still travelling, it is currently in Stockholm, Sweden and will travel to Belfast, Northern Ireland in early 2008. The publication Made with FontFont' – 'Type for independent minds' followed on from the 'FiFteen' exhibition in 2006, effectively being the catalogue for the exhibition. The objective in designing the typeface was to explore the contradictory idea of creating a design that looked hand-made or handwritten but was created using purely digital means. It connects to a controversial research focus on writing/lettering/type design that asserts that type {{is a form of}} clip-art. This theory is currently being explored by the designer in the form of further practical work and articles/papers for submission to the design press/international conferences. The work culminated in a family of related designs progressing from <b>ultra-light</b> to extra-heavy <b>weights.</b> It is now distributed throughout the design community via the agency of FSI and is being used as a tool by designers around the world...|$|R

40|$|To {{the main}} {{advantages}} of magnesium alloys belongs their low density, {{and just because}} of such property the alloys are used in aviation and rocket structures, and in all other applications, where mass of products have significant importance for conditions of their operation. To additional advantages of the magnesium alloys belongs good corrosion resistance, par with or even surpassing aluminum alloys. Magnesium is the lightest of all the engineering metals, having a density of 1. 74 g/cm 3. It is 35 % lighter than aluminum (2. 7 g/cm 3) and over four times lighter than steel (7. 86 g/cm 3). The Mg-Li alloys belong to a light-weight metallic structural materials having mass density of 1. 35 - 1. 65 g/cm 3, what means they are two times lighter than aluminum alloys. Such value of mass density means that density of these alloys is comparable with density of plastics used as structural materials, and therefore Mg–Li alloys belong to the lightest of all metal alloys.

Based on the successful development and ground-testing of a 20 m x 20 m deployable solar sail structure the in-orbit verification of the deployment principle and mechanisms is now being planned for launch in 2007. Kayser-Threde in collaboration with DLR has most recently completed a phase-B study of the solar sail project under ESA/ESTEC contract. In addition, mission and design studies have been performed at Kayser-Threde for <b>ultra-light</b> <b>weight</b> structures which can reach 100 m x 100 m in free space where a reflective, thin polyimide membrane is unfolded using DLR's advanced CFRP booms. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites require large and long antennas which in turn require a large satellite bus {{as well as a}} launcher with a large fairing. This is especially true for lower frequency SARs such as L-Band, where antenna sizes of typically 12 m x 3 m are required. The cost for such a SAR mission could be reduced significantly if the antenna and its deployment and support structure would be lightweight and could be folded during launch. The membrane antenna concept has been demonstrated in Canada by the CSA and EMS Technologies, and in the US by JPL. Receive only antennas are of interest for micro satellites which fly in a formation with a large active SAR satellite in order to perform SAR interferometry in a "Cartwheel" configuration.

Superplasticity of {{polycrystalline}} {{metallic materials}} {{is a phenomenon}} which shows hundreds to thousands of percents of large plastic deformation without necking in a steady state of low stress, when the uni-axial tensile loading is done in some special thermo-mechanical conditions (some limited ranges of properly high temperature and low strain rate). The main mechanism of superplastic phenomenon is the grain boundary sliding, while the main mechanism of usual plastic deformation is the trans-granular sliding. In this research, the possibility of superplastic deformation in a magnesium alloy (AZ 31 Mg alloy) was experimentally investigated, because generally speaking, the magnesium alloy whose atomic structure is hexagonal {{does not have enough}} formability in a form of trans-granular sliding mechanism.

30|$|An <b>ultra-light</b> <b>weight</b> and {{low power}} {{complexity}} MAC protocol is suggested {{with the support}} of three-way handshakes between a body coordinator and nodes [64]. The CSMA/CA access scheme can avoid data collision but this scheme creates overheads and increases a higher delay during data transmission due to RTS, CTS, DATA and acknowledgment (ACK). Thus, the suggested protocol [64] replaces the functionalities of CSMA/CA access scheme with ‘Data Request’ (DR), DATA and ACK. The DR maintains the address of each node whereas a node waits for DR message from the body coordinator before data transmission. During data transmission of a node- 1 to the body coordinator, all nodes turn-off their radio signals and change their states to the sleep states. Since, the body coordinator replies back with piggybacking message (ACK + DR 2) to a node- 1 when the body coordinator receives DATA. The [64] tries to change the control signal messages of the CSMA/CA scheme access but each node waits for a DR message before data transmission. Hence, the energy consumption of the suggested scheme is enhanced but the allocation of slots to nodes is based on the contention which reduces data reliability of sensory data in terms of a higher delay which is not acceptable for emergency data.|$|E

Ultra-compact/light, adaptive neural networks with massively parallel, asynchronous, fast reconfigurable and fault-tolerant information processing properties have already demonstrated significant potential for inflight diagnostic analyses and resource allocation with reduced ground dependence.

Especially laser additive manufacturing (LAM) enables the production of metallic parts with mechanical properties comparable to conventionally manufactured components. Due to the high geometrical freedom in LAM the technology enables the production of <b>ultra-light</b> <b>weight</b> designs and therefore gains increasing importance in aircraft and space industry. The high quality standards of these industries demand predictability of material properties for static and dynamic load cases. However, fatigue properties especially in the very high cycle fatigue regime until 10 9 cycles have not been sufficiently determined yet. Therefore this paper presents an analysis of fatigue properties of laser additive manufactured Ti- 6 Al- 4 V under cyclic tension-tension until 10 7 cycles and tension-compression load until 10 9 cycles. For the analysis of laser additive manufactured titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V Woehler fatigue tests under tension-tension and tension-compression were carried out in the high cycle and very high cycle fatigue regime. Specimens in stress-relieved as well as hot-isostatic-pressed conditions were analyzed regarding crack initiation site, mean stress sensitivity and overall fatigue performance. The determined fatigue properties show values in the range of conventionally manufactured Ti- 6 Al- 4 V with particularly good performance for hot-isostatic-pressed additive-manufactured material. For all conditions the results show no conventional fatigue limit but a constant increase in fatigue life with decreasing loads. No effects of test frequency on life span could be determined. However, independently of testing principle, a shift of crack initiation from surface to internal initiation could be observed with increasing cycles to failure...|$|E

Another interesting application of ORT carbon fibre architectures was reported by Hemrick et al. (Hemrick et al. 2011) in <b>ultra-light</b> <b>weight</b> heat exchangers for vehicle radiators. The application made use of the high thermal conductivity of ORT architecture as the through-thickness binder creates a conduction path for the heat dissipation, In addition, Sharp et al.

Commercially available metal foams are made mostly by aluminum alloys, which are manufactured using titanium hydride as a foaming agent. Iron based metal foam has several advantages over aluminum alloy foam such as high strength, high energy absorbability and low cost. However, {{it is hard to}} manufacture iron foam using conventional foaming agents because of a significant difference between their decomposition temperatures and melting point of iron. Further, even if good foaming agent can be utilized, it is also difficult to obtain iron foam with high porosity. In this study, therefore, new manufacturing method of porous iron by foaming of molten oxide and reduction of foamed oxide was studied. This foaming phenomenon is very famous in the field of steel making, while it should be suppressed. The tablet of Fe, Fe 2 O 3, Al 2 O 3, and CaCO 3 was heated rapidly in the crucible to foam the molten oxide by carbon dioxide generated from carbonate in the inert atmosphere. The target oxide system is FeO–Fe 2 O 3 –CaO–Al 2 O 3. The time, at which maximum porosity was obtained, became longer with decreasing the foaming temperature. This is because the decomposition rate of CO 2 from CaCO 3, which is foaming agent of this method, decreases with decreasing temperature. Maximum porosity of the oxide was approximately 57 % at 1350 °C, and the pore shape obtained in this study was spherical. After reduction of the iron oxide in the obtained foam to the reduction degree of 95 %, the composite material of metallic iron, oxide, and pore was obtained with higher porosity than this oxide...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ultra-light</b> <b>weight</b> and ultra-thin {{membrane}} inflatable antenna {{concepts are}} fast evolving {{to become the}} state-of-the-art antenna concepts for deep-space applications. NASA Langley Research Center {{has been involved in}} the structural dynamics research on antenna structures. One of the goals of the research is to develop structural analysis methodology for prediction of the static and dynamic response characteristics of the inflatable antenna concepts. This research is focused on the computational studies to use nonlinear large deformation finite element analysis to characterize the ultra-thin membrane responses of the antennas. Recently, structural analyses have been performed on a few parabolic reflector antennas of varying size and shape, which are referred in the paper as 0. 3 meters subscale, 2 meters half-scale, and 4 meters full-scale antenna. The various aspects studied included nonlinear analysis methodology and solution techniques, ways to speed convergence in iterative methods, the sensitivities of responses with respect to structural loads, such as inflation pressure, gravity, and pretension loads in the ground and in-space conditions, and the ultra-thin membrane wrinkling characteristics. Several such intrinsic aspects studied have provided valuable insight into evaluation of structural characteristics of such antennas. While analyzing these structural characteristics, a quick study was also made to assess the applicability of dynamics scaling of the half-scale antenna. This paper presents the details of the nonlinear structural analysis results, and discusses the insight gained from the studies on the various intrinsic aspects of the analysis methodology. The predicted reflector surface characteristics of the three inflatable ultra-thin membrane parabolic reflector antenna concepts are presented as easily observable displacement fringe patterns with associated maximum values, and normal mode shapes and associated frequencies. Wrinkling patterns are presented to show how surface wrinkle progress with increasing tension loads. Antenna reflector surface accuracies were found to be very much dependent on the type and size of the antenna, the reflector surface curvature, reflector membrane supports in terms of spacing of catenaries, as well as the amount of applied load...|$|E
