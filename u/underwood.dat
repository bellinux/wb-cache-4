5|$|Frank <b>Underwood</b> (Kevin Spacey) is {{an ambitious}} Democratic congressman and the House Majority Whip. <b>Underwood</b> helped ensure the {{election}} of President Garrett Walker (Michel Gill), who promised to appoint <b>Underwood</b> as Secretary of State. However, before Walker is sworn in, Chief of Staff Linda Vasquez (Sakina Jaffrey) announces {{that the president will}} not honor the agreement and will instead nominate Senator Michael Kern. Furious at Walker's betrayal, <b>Underwood</b> and his wife Claire (Robin Wright), an environmental activist, make a pact to destroy Kern.

5|$|<b>Underwood</b> {{announces that}} he will not run for reelection, and advocates for America Works, which he intends to pay for by {{stripping}} entitlement programs. He fails to get the bill through Congress and uses that as a reason to renege on his promise to not run in 2016. Solicitor General Heather Dunbar (Elizabeth Marvel) announces that she will seek the presidential nomination, and actually gives <b>Underwood</b> a battle. <b>Underwood</b> convinces Sharp to get married so she can announce her candidacy, for the sole reason of sapping womenâ€™s votes from Dunbar, at which point she will withdraw and accept the nomination for VP. After the presidential debate, in which <b>Underwood</b> publicly humiliates Sharp in order to go after Dunbar, Sharp retaliates by backing Dunbar's campaign. Ultimately, however, <b>Underwood</b> wins the Iowa caucuses.|$|E

The Underwoods lived in poverty, and nearly lost the farm when Frank was a child; to get a bank loan and avoid foreclosure, his father {{attended}} a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, of which the bank manager was a member. <b>Underwood</b> speaks fondly of his father in public, but this is a political ploy; in his asides to the audience, <b>Underwood</b> describes his father as a weak man who accomplished nothing with his life. He even urinates on his father's grave in season 3. Despite disliking his father, however, <b>Underwood</b> was influenced by him. Calvin was an abusive alcoholic and caused his wife and son years of misery. <b>Underwood</b> has said that when he was 13, he walked in on his father putting a shotgun in his mouth. Calvin asked him to pull the trigger, which he refused to do. He has stated that his biggest regret is not killing his father when he had the chance.|$|E
