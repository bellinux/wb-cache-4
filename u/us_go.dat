25|$|Soldiers, {{the second}} war of Poland is started; the first {{finished}} in Tilsit. In Tilsit, Russia swore eternal alliance in France and war in England. It violates its oaths today. Russia is pulled by its fate; its destinies must be achieved! Does it thus believe us degenerated? Thus let <b>us</b> <b>go</b> ahead; let us pass Neman River, carry {{the war on}} its territory. The second war of Poland will be glorious with the French Armies like the first one.|$|E
25|$|The {{historical}} {{antecedents of}} the Dream Chaser in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>go</b> {{back to the}} mid-twentieth century X-20 Dyna-Soar concept of 1957 and the 1966 Northrop M2-F2 and Martin X-23 PRIME lifting bodies. Its design is derived from NASA's 1990 HL-20 lifting body design which was itself similar to the 1970s Soviet Spiral, which in turn was considered by NASA engineers as influenced by the late 1960s HL-10, and the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-105 military spaceplane concept, a spaceplane studied {{as a means to}} develop a Soviet counterpart to the US's X-20 Dyna-Soar.|$|E

However, we cannot help to have some doubt as to the precise location of this Synod. Mart Moura's church, the generally assumed location for that synod celebration, is well known and its patronal saint's day is still celebrated every year with the fervent participation of the faithful from our village Kfarsghab, on September 24. Also, we think that there lies our village of origin, before unknown reasons to the local memory made <b>us</b> <b>go</b> down.|$|E

Boswell remarked, [...] "My feeling was just one large expanse of Stupor... I could not believe it. My imagination was not convinced." [...] William Gerard Hamilton joined in and stated, [...] "He has made a chasm, which not only nothing can fill up, but which nothing {{has a tendency to}} fill up. -Johnson is dead.- Let <b>us</b> <b>go</b> to the next best: There is nobody; -no man can be said to put you in mind of Johnson." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{video was}} then filmed in Budapest, Hungary over several days. [...] "The {{reason for the}} {{location}} stems from the music in the actual video. The ball needs to bounce synchronized with the 16th or 8th beat in the track. To do that, we needed a space with equidistant or closed surfaces to bounce around. A roof low to the floor but with uprights. Obviously parking lots are ideal. So the location thing happened mainly so it wouldn't fly into the sky. Being connoisseurs of parking lots, {{we wanted to find}} a good example. But it was a technical reason that made <b>us</b> <b>go</b> with it," [...] Knight said. Ne-o used an Arri Super 16mm film camera to shoot the film then edited it in Adobe Premiere Pro, with 3D animation using Autodesk Softimage.|$|E
500|$|Barbette was {{championed by}} avant garde artist Jean Cocteau. Cocteau wrote in 1923 to Belgian friend and critic Paul Collaer: [...] "Next week in Brussels, you'll see a music-hall act called 'Barbette' {{that has been}} keeping me enthralled for a fortnight. The young American who does this wire and trapeze act is a great actor, an angel, and he has become the friend to all of <b>us.</b> <b>Go</b> and see him ... and tell {{everybody}} that he is no mere acrobat in women's clothes, nor just a graceful daredevil, {{but one of the}} most beautiful things in the theatre. Stravinsky, Auric, poets, painters, and I myself have seen no comparable display of artistry on the stage since Nijinsky." [...] To other friends he wrote [...] "Your great loss for 1923 was Barbette – a terrific act at the Casino de Paris...Ten unforgettable minutes. A theatrical masterpiece. An angel, a flower, a bird." ...|$|E
500|$|Individual Beatles later commented {{about their}} {{memories}} of Hamburg, with Lennon reflecting, [...] "We'd outlived the Hamburg stage {{and wanted to}} pack that up. We hated going back to Hamburg those last two times. We'd had that scene. Brian [...] made <b>us</b> <b>go</b> back to fulfill the contract...". Harrison had positive memories of the period: [...] "I'd have to say with hindsight that Hamburg bordered on the best of Beatles times. We didn't have any luxury, we didn't have any bathrooms or any clothes, we were pretty grubby, we couldn't afford anything, {{but on the other}} hand we weren't yet famous, so we didn't have to contend with the bullshit that comes with fame." [...] McCartney was philosophical: [...] "Hamburg was certainly a great childhood memory. But I think all things are enhanced by time. It was very exciting, though I think it felt better to me a little later in our career, once we'd started to get a bit of success with the records." ...|$|E

500|$|This policy became {{immediately}} {{evident in}} the conciliatory attitude the new Caliph adopted towards his most powerful vassal, the Tulunids: in spring 893, al-Mu'tadid recognized and reconfirmed Khumarawayh in his office as autonomous emir over Egypt and Syria, in exchange for an annual tribute of 300,000 dinars and a further 200,000 dinars in arrears, {{as well as the}} return to caliphal control of the two Jaziran provinces of Diyar Rabi'a and Diyar Mudar. To seal the pact, Khumarawayh offered his daughter, Qatr al-Nada ("Dew Drop") as bride to one of the Caliph's sons, but al-Mu'tadid chose to marry her himself. The Tulunid princess brought with her a million dinars as her dowry, a [...] "wedding gift that was considered the most sumptuous in medieval Arab history" [...] (Thierry Bianquis). Her arrival in Baghdad was marked by the luxury and extravagance of her retinue, which contrasted starkly with the impoverished caliphal court. According to a story, after a thorough search, al-Mu'tadid's chief eunuch could only find five ornate silver-and-gold candlesticks to decorate the palace, while the princess was accompanied by 150 servants each carrying such a candlestick. Thereupon al-Mu'tadid is said to have remarked [...] "come let <b>us</b> <b>go</b> and hide ourselves, lest we be seen in our poverty".|$|E
500|$|In January 2016, Joss Whedon {{noted that}} this process [...] "unfortunately just means the TV show gets, you know, leftovers." [...] He stated that, for example, the series' {{creative}} team initially wanted to use Loki's scepter from The Avengers but were unable due to Whedon's plans for it in Age of Ultron. On how their ability {{to connect with the}} films changed {{over the life of the}} series, Jed Whedon said, [...] "The rule when we started was we couldn't say anything about spies, we couldn't say anything about Hydra, we couldn't have any A.I. or robots or anything like that, because all of that was coming in movies that year or the year after. Since then, they've blown those doors wide open." [...] He added, [...] "We have relatively free rein we just can't go anywhere that [...] going. They know their stories so much further out than we do, which is good for us to tee up things that we know are coming to them or avoid things that they want to be special on the big screen. As long as we are not covering bases that they're going to cover, we haven't been told [...] "no" [...] that much". As an example, Whedon noted the fourth season's Framework storyline as [...] "something that's pretty significant in our world, but is also a little eddy in the river that doesn't affect anything else because it's an alternate universe. So those kinds of stories help <b>us</b> <b>go</b> big without sending ripples through the whole MCU." ...|$|E
