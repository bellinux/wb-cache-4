60|$|Coming now to {{that great}} {{majority}} {{who will not}} choose idleness, I think we may assume that, {{with the help of}} science, and by the elimination of the vast amount of <b>unproductive</b> <b>work</b> involved in internal and international competition, the whole community could be kept in comfort by means of four hours' work a day. It is already being urged by experienced employers that their employes can actually produce as much in a six-hour day as they can when they work eight hours. In a world where there is a much higher level of technical instruction than there is now the same tendency will be accentuated. People will be taught not only, as at present, one trade, or one small portion of a trade, but several trades, so that they can vary their occupation according to the seasons and the fluctuations of demand. Every industry will be self-governing as regards all its internal affairs, and even separate factories will decide for themselves all questions that only concern those who work in them. There will not be capitalist management, as at present, but management by elected representatives, as in politics. Relations between different groups of producers will be settled by the Guild Congress, matters concerning the community as the inhabitants of a certain area will continue to be decided by Parliament, while all disputes between Parliament and the Guild Congress will be decided by a body composed of representatives of both in equal numbers.|$|E

5000|$|He was {{a member}} of the Central Road Board for eight years, a member of the Brighton District Council, President of the District Chairmen's Association, and a member of the Central Agricultural Society. He was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly for Noarlunga and served from March 1860 to November 1862 and for Encounter Bay November 1862 to April 1868. In {{politics}} he was a Liberal and Freetrader, opposed to State aid to religion in any form. He favoured a comprehensive system of State education, and worked to do away with nominated members in the Legislative Council, and considered that too much public money was being spent on <b>unproductive</b> <b>works</b> in the city, and more should be devoted to the development of the country by opening up by means of communication, leading to his being jocularly referred to as the [...] "Colossus of Roads". Distressed at the way the Land Fund was being squandered on supporting a bureaucracy bloated by nepotism and personal favours, introduced the Land Fund Appropriation Bill, colloquially [...] "Sutherland's Act", which, with the assistance of Sir Richard Hanson, was passed by both Houses. The effect of the Bill was to devote all funds arising from the sale or lease of public funds firstly to pay the interest on existing public debt; and second, to expend three quarters of the balance on productive public works and the rest on immigration. While it continued in operation the land fund constantly accumulated, but was resented by Ministers, for whom frugality was anathema and retrenchment was unpalatable. Eventually Sutherland's Act was repealed, rather than continue the farce of placing money in a Savings Bank, then borrowing an equal amount from the same bank for daily expenditure.|$|R

It was his reputed prowess as a marksman that earned him work as an extra at the British International Pictures studio on Arthur Robison's production of The Informer (1929), the first screen version of the Liam O'Flaherty novel. While he was working on The Informer he was asked to test for a production being shot on a neighbouring stage. Milland made a good impression on director Castleton Knight and was hired for his first acting role as Jim Edwards, in The Flying Scotsman (also 1929). Milland, in his autobiography, recalls that it was on this film that it was suggested he adopt a stage name; and chose Milland from the Mill lands area of his Welsh home town of Neath.|$|R

2500|$|It is {{important}} for organizations to understand and to structure the work environment to encourage productive behaviors and discourage those that are <b>unproductive</b> given <b>work</b> motivation's role in influencing workplace behavior and performance. There is general consensus that motivation involves three psychological processes: arousal, direction, and intensity. Arousal is what initiates action. It is fueled by a person's need or desire for something that is missing from their lives at a given moment, either totally or partially. Direction refers to the path employees take in accomplishing the goals they set for themselves. Finally, intensity is the vigor and amount of energy employees put into this goal-directed work performance. The level of intensity {{is based on the}} importance and difficulty of the goal. These psychological processes result in four outcomes. [...] First, motivation serves to direct attention, focusing on particular issues, people, tasks, etc. It also serves to stimulate an employee to put forth effort. Next, motivation results in persistence, preventing one from deviating from the goal-seeking behavior. Finally, motivation results in task strategies, which as defined by Mitchell & Daniels, are [...] "patterns of behavior produced to reach a particular goal.|$|R

5000|$|Sovani {{argues that}} there is little {{evidence}} for the greater role of [...] "push" [...] factor of increased population in rural areas, as even countries where there is little pressure for land experience this phenomenon, but that instead the opportunity for higher income is responsible for the excessive migration and pressure on cities, as the salary for an unproductive job in an urban area was almost always higher than the salary for <b>unproductive</b> <b>work</b> in a rural area. [...] Graves and Sexton also emphasize that individuals move despite negative factors such as overcrowding, suggesting that individuals still see urban migration as an overall benefit. They argue that if the benefits do indeed outweigh the costs for society as a whole, then the term [...] "overurbanization" [...] is not appropriate to describe the phenomenon. Gugler argues that while the benefits outweigh the costs for an individual migrating to an urban area, greater costs such as resource scarcity and widespread unemployment and poverty are present when this occurs at a larger scale.|$|E
50|$|The {{government}} said the database {{was set up}} to improve child protection by improving the way information about children was shared between services. Only professionals whose job involves supporting children would be able to access the database, and they would be required to undergo enhanced Criminal Records Bureau checks and training. Each local authority would decide who may access the database provided their role was listed in the ContactPoint Regulations. Users would need to provide a reason for accessing a record, and an audit trail would be kept on access to the database to help detect misuse. Professionals who have completed a Common Assessment Framework, a tool used to identify the severity of a child's situation, would be able to record on a child's record that they had carried this out. No information discovered in this way would be held on ContactPoint. Under the Data Protection Act, all organisations supplying data to the database would have to inform children and guardians through fair-processing notices. Subjects of the database could make accessrequests, in writing, to view any personal data that organisations hold on them on the database and to correct any mistakes.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the contributions}} of operational research {{to the work of}} the Royal Canadian Air Force Eastern Air Command during the Second World War. The efforts of the handful of Canadian operational researchers in the Allied campaign against the German U-boat force, although having produced only modest results, did make a small but important contribution to the war which have been neglected by historians. The use of aircraft against submarines began during the First World War when both technologies were still in their infancy. Although initial results were poor, the handful of sinkings by aircraft demonstrated its potential as a counter to the seemingly invulnerable submarine. Great Britain, with its vulnerable seaward lines of communication, emerged by 1918 as the leader in the development of anti-submarine aircraft, largely through the co-operative efforts of scientists and airmen to reﬁne and advance the concept of airborne anti-submarine warfare. Although much of this knowledge was squandered through the neglect of the Royal Air Force’s land-based anti-submarine aircraft force during the inter-war period, the early introduction of scientists to the ﬁeld of airborne anti-submarine warfare provided a precedent for a future revival of this relationship. The techniques of operational research, ﬁrst promulgated during the British experiments with radar during the 1930 s, were, by 1941, applied to assist Royal Air Force Coastal Command in its campaign against the German U-boats which were taking an ever-increasing toll of Allied shipping. The work of P. M. S. Blackett and his staff at Coastal Command Operational Research Section would serve as the foundation upon which Eastern Air Command’s Operational Research Section (ORS) would be constructed when it was created in November 1942. Under the leadership of Professor Colin Barnes and later Dr. J. W. T. Spinks, Eastern Air Command ORS produced a series of studies which explored issues of concern to the Command’s anti-submarine (bomber-reconnaissance) squadrons. They used methodologies adapted for Canadian purposes from the original British and American models. These studies of diverse topics such as bombing accuracy and search techniques for missing aircraft, along with the squadron and Command efficiency data collected in operational planning role assumed by Eastern Air Command ORS (one which had earlier been rejected as <b>unproductive</b> clerical <b>work</b> by Coastal Command ORS), characterized the growth of Canadian-oriented operational research during the ﬁnal three years of the Second World War. The work of the handful of civilian and military operational researchers at Eastern Air Command ORS, although threatened with elimination during the deep cuts to the military in the immediate post-war years, survived to form part of the body of Canadian military operational research techniques which has assisted the Canadian Forces in their duties throughout the last half-century...|$|R
40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} reports studies {{directed}} to developing a calpain cysteine protease inhibitor that could be of value in slowing cataract development in humans. The work focuses {{on the development of}} macrocyclic compounds which can have advantages over acyclic compounds due to their resistance to proteolytic hydrolysis, improved selectivity, bioavailability and membrane permeability. A review of X-ray crystal structures of natural and synthetic calpain inhibitors complexed with the cysteine protease calpain show the inhibitors generally bind in the enzyme active site in an extended β-strand conformation. The calpain inhibitor SJA- 6017 has been identified as a suitable lead compound. The importance of the para-fluoro group in SJA- 6017 has been investigated. Modifications have been made to constrain this basic structure within a macrocycle and restrict the peptide chain as a β-strand conformation. Macrocycle CAT 811 is a potent calpain 1 and 2 inhibitor and shows promise in slowing the progression of cortical cataract in trials with sheep having a hereditary propensity towards the development of cataract. In this thesis I report studies directed to improve the yield of the key RCM macrocyclisation step in the synthesis of aldehyde CAT 811 and of three ester analogues (2. 1, 2. 3 and 2. 4). I also report the development of a more commercial route to CAT 811 not involving RCM but using intramolecular nucleophilic cyclisation. This intramolecular nucleophilic cyclisation strategy was attempted for the preparation of a histidine containing macrocyclic ester (4. 1 a) but was unsuccessful. An alternate strategy involving intramolecular lactamization proved successful for the synthesis of histidine-based macrocyclic esters (4. 1 a- 4. 3 a). Reduction to the corresponding alcohols (4. 1 b- 4. 3 b) was successful and oxidation of (4. 1 b and 4. 3 b) afforded the corresponding aldehydes (4. 1 c and 4. 3 c) for biological assay against ovine calpain 2. Aldehyde 4. 3 c has an IC 50 of 1 μM and the corresponding alcohol 4. 3 b shows no activity (IC 50 > 50 μM) consistent with the modelling which indicated that these two compounds did not adopt a β-strand conformation in the docking studies. Aldehyde 4. 1 c, on the other hand, shows significant inhibitory activity with an IC 50 of 238 nM but as expected the corresponding alcohol 4. 1 b shows little activity (IC 50 = 29 μM). Modelling studies showed that both the aldehyde 4. 1 c and the alcohol 4. 1 b on docking can form a β-strand with appropriate H-bonding interactions. The aldehyde is more active than the alcohol due to the reactivity of the aldehyde warhead allowing for the reversible formation of a hemiacetal. A similar difference in reactivity is observed for CAT 811 (30 nM) and its alcohol analogue (700 nM). These results demonstrate the value of molecular modelling as a screening mechanism before <b>unproductive</b> synthetic <b>work</b> is considered...|$|R

But paradoxically, it is also a means by which we have come to ignore the ethical, the slow, the serendipitous and un-reciprocated gift. In response, industrialised space has become marked by protest as part of a repertoire of tactics to catch the eye, the attention of the passer-by, to offer alternative thoughts on the use of space and the power relations that underpin it; or simply to reinforce that someone ‘was here’, to not be submerged into urban homogeneity, to be recognised as existing.

40|$|The role of Poverty Alleviation Programs (PAP) in �ghting {{poverty and}} {{ensuring}} {{the satisfaction of}} basic economic needs is well known. How- ever, informational asymmetries create the need for adequate instruments to prevent fraud. This paper provides a static model of adverse selection where the gov- ernment (principal) aims to minimize the costs of a PAP that ensures that all individuals have access to an exogenously de�ned minimum in- come level. Agents may di¤er in their income-generating ability and disutility of labor. Under the di¤erent informational environments, we study the ef- fectiveness of workfare (that involves unpaid and <b>unproductive</b> <b>work</b> in the public sector) as a screening device, based on the comparison with standard monitoring. We �nd that when disutility of labor is the only unobservable variable, a workfare policy is ine¢ cient because it �crowds out�private sector work and signi�cantly increases {{the costs of the}} program. Under this informa- tional context, monitoring may be the best instrument for preventing fraud. When income-generating ability is the only unobservable variable, choosing between workfare and monitoring depends not only on the cost function associated with the latter, but also on income distribution. The analysis of this case would suggest that a workfare policy might be inef- �cient in the context of undeveloped countries where income distribution exhibits strong inequalities, but appropriate in developed ones. These conclusions suggest that a mixed policy combining workfare and monitor- ing may be optimal when both income-generating ability and disutility of labor are unknown. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{eucalyptus}} {{has recently}} become {{important to the}} timber supply in Thailand, especially for the pulp industry. The demand for raw material is continuously increasing, but the harvesting techniques continue to rely on old-fashioned methods of harvesting, which are motor-manual and labour-intensive operations. These harvesting operations typically provide relatively low productivity and are time consuming. This study addressed the timber harvesting potential in Thailand: the average productivity, which tasks are ineffective work phases, and how the work performance can be improved. Therefore, {{the study was conducted}} to comprehend the existing timber harvesting systems as a whole, to compare the alternatives and to explore improvements in forest harvesting systems in Thailand through work study, working postures analysis, and simulation. Work study allowed the researcher to understand in detail the conventional harvesting systems and obtain information regarding work activities and time allocations. Harmful tasks and awkward working postures were evaluated by working posture analysis. Simulation allowed the researcher to examine the impact of changing harvesting systems. The study confirmed that motor-manual operations have a rather low production rate compared to intermediate and fully mechanized harvesting techniques, which are applied {{in other parts of the}} world. The most <b>unproductive</b> <b>work</b> phase is cross-cutting, and further research should pay attention to this work phase. According to the working postures analysis, the most problematic working postures found for manual tasks included stacking, delimbing, and loading. Simulation findings suggested that reorganization of job sequences is one major possibility for improving productivity. Log length and tree size also have a significant effect on overall productivity. Further research should consider enhancing the system with partial mechanization, such as farm tractors, skidders and multi-tree-handling harvesters. Education and training are also important measures to increase not only work performance, but also to improve work safety. Thaimaalaiselle puunhuollolle eucalyptuksen saatavuus on muodostunut hiljattain tärkeäksi, erityisesti selluloosateollisuudelle. Raaka-aineen tarve nousee jatkuvasti, mutta korjuu menetelmät pohjautuvat edelleen vanhanaikaisiin, työvoimavaltaisiin korjuumenetelmiin. Tämä menetelmä pohjautuu paikalliseen osaamiseen ja eikä vaadi suurta taloudellista panostusta, jolloin myös tuloksena on suhteellisen alhainen tuotannon aste. Tämän tutkimuksen tavoitteena on esitellä vaihtoehtoja korjuumenetelmien suhteen thaimaalaisissa olosuhteissa ja lisäksi myös parantaa työntekijöiden hyvinvointia. Tutkimuksessa on vertailtu olemassa olevan puunkorjuun menetelmää vaihtoehtoisiin menetelmiin ja etsiä parannuksia puunkorjuuseen Thaimaassa. Tutkimustulosten mukaan työvoimavaltaisella menetelmällä on varsin alhainen tuottoaste verrattuna osittain koneellistettuun tai täysin koneellistettuun tekniikkaan, mitkä ovat käytössä muualla maailmassa. Simuloinnin tulokset osoittavat, että työjärjestyksen uudelleen organisoinnin avulla on mahdollista parantaa tuottavuutta merkittävästi. Jatkotutkimusten tulisi keskittyä parantamaan osittaista koneellistumista, kuten maataloustraktoreiden, juontotraktoreiden tai joukkokäsittelyn käyttöä.
