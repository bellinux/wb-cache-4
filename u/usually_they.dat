5|$|The {{problem with}} the {{animation}} from the producers' point-of-view was {{that it did not}} exhibit a distinct style envisioned for the show. At the time {{there were only a few}} choices for animation style. <b>Usually,</b> <b>they</b> would either follow the style of Disney, Warner Bros., or Hanna-Barbera. Disney and Warner Bros. cartoons had a universe that was bendy and the characters seemed to be made of rubber. The producers wanted a realistic environment in which the characters and objects could not do anything that was not possible in the real world. One example with the early animation being cartoonish was that the doors behaved liked rubber when slammed. The style of Hanna-Barbera featured the use of cartoon sounds, which they did not want either.|$|E

Disney and Warner Bros. cartoons had a universe that was bendy and the characters seemed to be made of rubber. The producers wanted a realistic environment in which the characters and objects could not do anything that was not possible in the real world. One example of AKOM's early work that was considered by the producers to be too cartoonish was that the doors throughout in the episode were animated with the same rubber effect that they wanted to avoid. The style of Hanna-Barbera featured the use of cartoon sounds, which they did not want either.|$|E
5|$|When hatched, {{the chicks}} are downy. Neither altricial nor precocial, the chicks {{begin to move}} around and explore their {{surroundings}} within one to three days after hatching. <b>Usually</b> <b>they</b> do not stray far from the nest. Chicks are brooded by the adults for the first ten days after hatching. Both parents care for hatchlings. Chick diets always include fish, and parents selectively bring larger prey items to chicks than they eat themselves. Males bring more food than females. Feeding by the parents lasts for roughly a month before being weaned off slowly. After fledging, the juveniles learn to feed themselves, including the difficult method of plunge-diving. They will fly south to winter {{with the help of}} their parents.|$|E

They have a cremaster {{at the tip of}} the abdomen. <b>Usually,</b> <b>they</b> pupate off the host plant, in an {{underground}} chamber, among rocks, or in a loose cocoon. In most species, the pupa is the overwintering stage.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> ignore humans, <b>they</b> {{will react}} {{if they feel}} threatened. They defend {{themselves}} with their tusks. A collared peccary will release a strong musk or give a sharp bark if it is alarmed.|$|R

25|$|Levonorgestrel-releasing implant is {{implanted}} {{under the}} skin in the upper arm of a woman, by creating a small incision and inserting the capsules in a fanlike shape. Insertion usually takes 15 minutes and the capsules can sometimes be seen {{under the skin}}, although <b>usually</b> <b>they</b> look like small veins. They can also be felt under the skin. Once inserted, the contraceptive works within 24 hours and lasts up to five years.|$|E

Examples of avian predators other than cuckoos that feed on hairy caterpillars include at least tens of species from several continents.|$|E
25|$|Each {{team can}} field six players {{at a time}} on the court, one player being a goalkeeper.

The team is also allowed to change players any time in the game, <b>usually</b> <b>they</b> change the whole team. Individual substitution happens sometimes, but it usually happens when a player is exhausted or is hurt.|$|E
