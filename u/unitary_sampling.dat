40|$|The use of unitary {{invariant}} subspaces of a Hilbert space H is nowadays {{a recognized}} fact {{in the treatment}} of sampling problems. Indeed, shift-invariant subspaces of L 2 (R) and also periodic extensions of finite signals are remarkable examples where this occurs. As a consequence, the availability of an abstract <b>unitary</b> <b>sampling</b> theory becomes a useful tool to handle these problems. In this paper we derive a sampling theory for tensor products of unitary invariant subspaces. This allows merging the cases of finitely/infinitely generated unitary invariant subspaces formerly studied in the mathematical literature; it also allows introducing the several variables case. As the involved samples are identified as frame coefficients in suitable tensor product spaces, the relevant mathematical technique is that of frame theory, involving both finite/infinite dimensional cases...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally the {{compressive}} sensing theory {{have been}} {{focusing on the}} three principles of sparsity, incoherence and uniform random subsampling. Recent years research have shown that these principles yield insufficient results in many practical setups. This has {{lead to the development}} of the principles of asymptotic sparsity, asymptotic incoherence and multilevel random subsampling. As a result of these principles, the current theory is limited to <b>unitary</b> <b>sampling</b> and sparsifying operators. For large scale reconstruction, the theory is further restricted to operators whose product can be computed in O(N log N) operations, due to memory constraints of computers. Accordingly this has increased the popularity of the Fourier and Hadamard sampling operators, for applications where these operators can model the underlying sampling structure. As the sparsifying operator the wavelet transform have proven to yield satisfactory results in most setups. Since all of these operators needs to be unitary, this have restricted us to only consider Daubechies compactly supported orthonormal wavelets. By using wavelets as the sparsifying transform it has been proven that a Fourier sampling basis will be asymptotically incoherent to a unitary wavelet basis. The same result can easily be calculated numerically between a Hadamard sampling basis and a Daubechies wavelet basis. However, any theoretical result of this fact have been lacking. The purpose of this text is to provide such a theoretical result...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} {{was to examine the}} blocking effect {{within the context of a}} stimulus equivalence paradigm. Ten subjects were provided with a prior history of matching <b>unitary</b> <b>sample</b> stimuli to <b>unitary</b> comparisons. Next, the same stimuli appeared as elements of sample stimulus compounds with additional, redundant elements. During the equivalence test, the elements of each compound were separated, and the extent to which the elements had entered separately into equivalence relations with the other stimuli was examined. Five subjects demonstrated the formation of three three-member equivalence classes and showed a strong blocking effect. The other five subjects did not demonstrate the formation of three-member classes, nor did they show a strong blocking effect. The strength of the relations between the elements of each stimulus compound was shown to be consistent with the degree to which the blocking effect was observed. Subjects 2 ̆ 7 percentage reinforcement estimates were also found to correspond to their performance during the equivalence test. The overt verbal behavior emitted by four subjects who were required to talk aloud during the experiment did not correlate with their nonverbal performance...|$|R
40|$|The transformations {{we apply}} to the raw data (Xit) to induce {{stationarity}} (xit) are: transformation Description 1 xit = (1 − L 3) (1 + L + L 2) Xit quarterly difference 2 xit = (1 − L 3) (1 + L + L 2) log Xit × 100 quarterly growth rate 3 xit = (1 − L 3) (1 + L + L 2) (1 − L 12) log Xit × 100 quarterly difference of yearly growth rate Our transformations are such that the transformed variables correspond to a quarterly quantity when observed {{at the end of}} the quarter. The particular transformation that we apply to a given series is reported below in column 4 of the table in Section C. Note that transformation 3 removes trends integrated up to order two and is applied to prices and nominal wages, which are characterized by the quite persistent yearly inflation rates. A. 2 Estimation of the Model The parameters of the model are estimated using data up to the last date when the balanced panel is available. In this section, for expositional convenience, we drop the dependence of data on the vintage. We denote by T the sample size used for the estimation of the parameters. For any given vintage vj we have T = min{T 1 vj, [...] .,Tnvj}. We first standardize the data so as they have sample mean equal to zero and <b>unitary</b> <b>sample</b> variance: zit =...|$|R
40|$|It was {{recently}} conjectured by Fyodorov, Hiary and Keating that the maximum of the characteristic polynomial {{on the unit}} circle of a N× N random <b>unitary</b> matrix <b>sampled</b> from the Haar measure grows like CN/(N) ^ 3 / 4 for some random variable C. In this paper, we verify the leading order of this conjecture, that is, we prove that with high probability the maximum lies in the range [N^ 1 - ε,N^ 1 + ε], for arbitrarily small ε. The method is based on identifying an approximate branching random walk in the Fourier decomposition of the characteristic polynomial, and uses techniques developed to describe the extremes of branching random walks and of other log-correlated random fields. A key technical input is the asymptotic analysis of Toeplitz determinants with dimension-dependent symbols. The original argument for these asymptotics followed the general idea that the statistical mechanics of 1 /f-noise random energy models is governed by a freezing transition. We also prove the conjectured freezing of the free energy for random unitary matrices. Comment: 39 pages, added theorem on the imaginary part and the implied rigidity boun...|$|R
40|$|We combine {{concepts}} {{from random}} matrix theory and free probability together with {{ideas from the}} theory of commutator length in groups and maps from surfaces, and establish new connections between the two. More particularly, we study measures induced by free words on the unitary groups U(n). Every word w in the free group F_r on r generators determines a word map from U(n) ^r to U(n), defined by substitutions. The w-measure on U(n) {{is defined as the}} pushforward via this word map of the Haar measure on U(n) ^r. Let Tr_w(n) denote the expected trace of a random <b>unitary</b> matrix <b>sampled</b> from U(n) according to the w-measure. It was shown by Voiculescu [Voic 91 '] that for w 1 this expected trace is o(n) asymptotically in n. We relate the numbers Tr_w(n) to the theory of commutator length of words and obtain a much stronger statement: Tr_w(n) =O(n^ 1 - 2 g), where g is the commutator length of w. Moreover, we analyze the number _n→∞n^ 2 g- 1 · Tr_w(n) and show it is an integer which, roughly, counts the number of (equivalence classes of) solutions to the equation [u_ 1,v_ 1] [...] . [u_g,v_g]=w with u_i,v_i ∈ F_r. Similar results are obtained for finite sets of words and their commutator length, and we deduce that one can 'hear' the stable commutator length of a word by 'listening' to its unitary measures.

40|$|Using {{the theory}} {{developed}} by Browning and Chiappori (1998), namely the collective household model, I analyze bargaining between spouses and its determinants in Turkey. I test whether the 1994 Turkish Household Survey data {{are consistent with}} the collective model or with the alternative unitary model (in which the couple is modeled as a single decision-maker). Furthermore, focusing on a sub-sample from rural developing areas, I analyze the implications of labor force participation for women’s decision-making power in households. The findings of the paper are threefold. First, in the full sample of households in which both spouses work, I reject the unitary model and fail to reject the collective model for couples, a finding which is consistent with a bargaining process involving two decision-makers. Second, a reduced sample from rural South-Eastern and Eastern Turkey is consistent with the unitary model. In these households, in which women do not earn income outside the household, {{there is no evidence of}} bargaining. In fact, the unitary model ceases to be supported in favor of bargaining again when women have outside options, namely when they earn income. In the <b>unitary</b> model <b>sample,</b> more than 40 percent of women are working as non-paid family workers, but do not earn independent income. Therefore, what appears to determine participation in decision-making is not working per se, but formal participation in the labor market and earning an income which is independent of the husband’s. Third, I find that having a son (who is likely to become an income-earner) as opposed to having a daughter (who is likely to become a non-paid worker) is an important determinant in household decision-making...|$|R
