40|$|My {{thesis is}} focused on the issues related to a sale of <b>undertaking</b> or part of <b>undertaking</b> {{pursuant}} to the Contract on the Sale of <b>Undertaking.</b> This contract type is governed by the provisions of S. 477 - 488 a of the Commercial Code. After the introduction contained in the first chapter, the second chapter deals with the legal definition of an <b>Undertaking</b> and its part. The concept of <b>Undertaking</b> described in the Czech Commercial Code is broadly constructed in order to cover many different components as a part of any <b>Undertaking.</b> The important distinction between the European law and the laws of the Czech Republic is that the Czech law understands the <b>undertaking</b> merely as a specific object of legal relations. The European law, however, recognized the <b>Undertaking</b> as a subject of legal relations. The third chapter identifies other contract types which could cause the same results as the sale of undertaking; among other the sales contract and specific innominated contract. The legal provisions of contract for sale of <b>Undertaking</b> describe the consequences of the sale and analyzed in the fourth chapter of the thesis. The most important legal issues of this contract type can be identified as (i) the transfer of rights and obligations, (ii) exclusion of certain components of the <b>Undertaking,</b> (iii) liability for [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Joe Dante {{and then}} Peter Jackson were {{considered}} as directors for The World Is Not Enough. Barbara Broccoli enjoyed Jackson's Heavenly Creatures, and {{a screening of}} The Frighteners was arranged for her. She disliked the latter film, however, and showed no further interest in Jackson. Michael Apted was then selected to lead the film. Writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade were hired after their work in Plunkett & Macleane, before Michael Apted and his wife, screenwriter Dana Stevens, <b>undertook</b> an uncredited rewrite. Pierce Brosnan was unhappy with some of Stevens' changes to his character, so Michael G. Wilson—who was also uncredited as screenwriter—and Bruce Feirstein <b>undertook</b> further revisions.|$|E

40|$|An {{enforceable}} <b>undertaking</b> is {{a promise}} enforceable in court. In it, the alleged offender, {{known as the}} promisor, promises the regulator (for {{the purpose of this}} article the Australian Securities and Investments Commission) to do or not to do certain actions.
