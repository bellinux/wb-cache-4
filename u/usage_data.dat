5|$|The poor demand {{resulted}} in price cuts for various Windows RT products; in April 2013 {{the price of}} Dell's XPS 10 fell from US$450 US to $300, and Microsoft began offering free covers for its Surface tablet in some territories as a limited-time promotion—itself a US$130 value for the Type Cover alone. Microsoft also reportedly reduced the cost of Windows RT licenses for devices with smaller screens, hoping that this could spur interest in the platform. In July 2013, Microsoft cut {{the price of the}} first-generation Surface worldwide by 30%, with its U.S. price falling to $350. Concurrently, Microsoft reported a loss of US$900 million due to the lackluster sales of the device. In August 2013, Dell silently pulled the option to purchase the XPS 10 from its online store without a keyboard dock (raising its price back up to US$479), and pulled the device entirely in September 2013. Microsoft's discount on the Surface tablet did result in a slight increase of market share for the device; in late-August 2013, <b>usage</b> <b>data</b> from the advertising network AdDuplex (which provides advertising services within Windows Store apps) revealed that Surface usage had increased from 6.2 to 9.8%.|$|E

25|$|The Software Configuration Management system, is {{a system}} at the vendor’s site which keeps track of the {{configurations}} at the customer site.

Also there needs to be configuration data, some generic information about the configuration the customer is using. For example what operating platform the customer uses for its software.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} mobile <b>data</b> <b>usage</b> in South African townships. In contrast to previous studies, which have studied mobile <b>data</b> <b>usage</b> in developing regions (including South Africa), we focus our study on two townships in South Africa; the extremely resource-constrained nature of townships sheds light, for the first time, on how people in these communities use mobile data. We perform a mixed-methods study, combining quantitative network measurements of mobile app usage with qualitative survey data to gain insights about mobile <b>data</b> <b>usage</b> patterns and the underlying reasons for user behavior concerning mobile <b>data</b> <b>usage.</b> Due to the limited availability of public free Wi-Fi and despite the relatively high cost of mobile data, we find that a typical township user's median mobile <b>data</b> <b>usage</b> is significantly more than Wi-Fi usage. As expected, and consistent with observations of mobile <b>data</b> <b>usage</b> in parts of South Africa with better resources, users tend to favor using Wi-Fi for streaming video applications, such as YouTube. Interestingly, however, unlike users in less resource-constrained settings, township users also consume significant mobile data to update mobile applications, as opposed to relying on Wi-Fi networks for application updates. These behaviors suggest that network and mobile application designers must {{pay more attention to}} <b>data</b> <b>usage</b> patterns on cellular networks to provide mobile network architectures that provide more cost-effective mechanisms for tasks such as application update...|$|R

[...] It is reported that TfL's long-term aim is to stop handling money and collecting fares altogether. [...] The same requirement to touch in and out on underground services applies to contactless cards. [...] The same price capping that applies to the use of Oyster cards applies to the use of contactless cards (provided the same card is used for the day's journeys). [...] The fare paid every day is settled with the bank and appears on the debit or credit card statement.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Data</b> <b>usage</b> control {{provides}} {{mechanisms for}} data owners {{to remain in}} control over how their data is used {{after it has been}} shared. Many <b>data</b> <b>usage</b> policies can only be enforced on a global scale, as they refer to <b>data</b> <b>usage</b> events happening within multiple distributed sys-tems: ‘not more than three employees may ever read this document’, or ‘no copy of this document may be modified after it has been archived’. While such global policies can be enforced by a centralized enforcement infrastructure that observes all <b>data</b> <b>usage</b> events in all relevant systems, such a strategy involves heavy communication. We show how the overall coordination overhead can be reduced by deploying a decentralized en-forcement infrastructure. Our contributions are: (i) a formal distributed <b>data</b> <b>usage</b> control system model; (ii) formal methods for identifying all systems relevant for evaluating a given policy; (iii) identification of sit-uations in which no coordination between systems is necessary without compromising policy enforcement; (iv) proofs of correctness of (ii, iii). ...|$|R
