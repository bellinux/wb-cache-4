5|$|In {{response}} to Thio's {{point on the}} views of the Wee Chong Jin Constitutional Commission, Shanmugam said that at the time the report was rendered the electorate was immature and <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> importance of voting, a result of the country's history of colonial rule. In contrast, the high voter turnout rates in every election since then evidenced that Singaporeans have realized this point. With regard to the Taw Cheng Kong case, Shanmugam stated that since the Court's observations were obiter, they were unlikely to be treated as setting a precedent.|$|E
5|$|The black raven shakes himself, and he {{responds}} {{that he and}} the rest of the ravens have followed Harald since hatching from their eggs. The raven expresses surprise that the valkyrie seems <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> deeds of Harald, and tells her about his deeds for several stanzas. At stanza 15, a question and answer format begins where the valkyrie asks the raven a question regarding Harald, and the raven responds in turn. This continues until the poem ends abruptly.|$|E
5|$|After {{designing}} {{their own}} pro skateboard, the protagonist and Eric {{embark on a}} team trip to Moscow, Russia, where they reconcile. However, Eric gets drunk and joyrides in a Russian military tank. The protagonist hops in and attempts to stop the tank, but being <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> controls, fails to stop it from crashing. Eric jumps out and runs away, leaving the protagonist, trapped inside, to be arrested by the Russian military. Eric then lies and claims the protagonist stole the tank, stating that he in fact tried to stop them. Unwilling to pay the $700,000 worth of damages, Todd kicks the protagonist off the team, much to Eric's delight. The American Embassy bails out the protagonist, leaving them to do favors for locals in order to return home to New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|Changes in {{the budget}} led to {{established}} actors being cast in smaller roles, including Adolfo Celi as the villain Valmont and Michel Piccoli as Ginko. John Philip Law was cast as Diabolik as a favour by De Laurentiis after production on Barbarella, which Law was acting in, was postponed due to technical difficulties. Law was initially <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> characters in either Barbarella and Diabolik, and read the comic books to understand the characters. Initially, the role of Eva Kant {{was going to be}} played by an unidentified American model, but she was fired before shooting began.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest {{was created}} by Yuji Horii, who took {{inspiration}} from previous role-playing games such as Wizardry, Ultima, and his own 1983 title The Portopia Serial Murder Case. Horii wanted to create an RPG which would appeal to a wide audience {{of people who were}} <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> genre of video games in general. He tried to place a greater emphasis on storytelling and emotional involvement, as well as simplify the interface and expose the mostly Western computer genre to the Japanese console market. Manga artist and Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama produced the game's artwork and Koichi Sugiyama composed its music. The North American version featured numerous changes, including battery-backed RAM save games (rather than using a password save system), modified character sprites and pseudo-Elizabethan English style dialog.|$|E
5|$|Each {{successive}} {{scene in}} the sequence was shorter {{than the one before}} it by exactly one frame. The scene where Bart writes his confession was done as one long take to balance the shorter scenes elsewhere in the episode. It was animated in the United States by Dan Haskett. There were a few problems with the finished animation for the episode. The banana in the opening scene was colored incorrectly, as the Korean animators were <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fruit, and the final bathtub scene was particularly problematic, including issues with lip sync. The version in the broadcast episode was the best of several attempts.|$|E
50|$|Weiner {{initially}} {{had difficulty}} find an agent. As a former journalist, she was <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> how <b>the</b> publishing world operated, {{and she made}} errors when submitting her work. Once she found an agent with whom she could easily collaborate, she said the book was quickly published.|$|R
5000|$|Disregarding tone, 道 is {{pronounced}} [...] in Standard Chinese. This pronunciation cannot be correctly reproduced by most native English speakers who are <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> Chinese. <b>The</b> argument between {{the proponents of}} Dao and Tao hinges not on {{which of the two}} is correct, but which of the two spellings read aloud will better approximate the Chinese.|$|R
5000|$|MS Saga: A New Dawn ("The Legend of the Lost G"), is a {{role-playing}} {{game for}} the PlayStation 2 console based on the Gundam franchise.

5|$|Following {{the appeal}} of the Polish Four-Year Sejm to all Poles serving abroad to join the Polish army, and not seeing much {{opportunity}} to advance in his military career in the now-peaceful Saxony, on 28 June 1792 he joined the Army of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth with a rank of podpułkownik and on 14 July he was promoted to the rank of vice-brigadier. Joining in the final weeks of the Polish–Russian War of 1792, he did not see combat in it. <b>Unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> intricasies of Polish politics, like many of Poniatowski's supporters, he joined the Targowica Confederation in late 1792.|$|E
5|$|Hensley was short, {{normally}} soft-spoken, {{and friendly}} with churchgoers. Most attendees at his services were miners or farmers from the Appalachian Mountains; congregants typically arrived at services on horseback or in a Ford Model A. Many were from Holiness Pentecostal backgrounds, but <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> snake-handling practice. Hensley's sister Bertha, {{who lived in}} Ohio, was also a licensed minister with the Church of God. In 1922, he conducted services with her in Ohio. Around that time, more articles documenting his ministry {{were published in the}} denomination's newsletter, and by the early 1920s snakes were regularly handled in Church of God services.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} inquiry, chaired by Rear Admiral Reinhold von Werner, Monts {{testified that he}} had not been given {{sufficient}} time to familiarize himself with the ship and its crew, who were themselves <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> vessel. Monts argued that the mobilization process for the newly commissioned ship should have lasted four to six weeks, rather than the three he had been given. The day before the squadron left Wilhelmshaven, Batsch complained to General Albrecht von Stosch, the chief of the Kaiserliche Marine, that a significant number of dockyard workers were still finishing work on Grosser Kurfürst. Werner and the board determined that Admiral Batsch was at fault and exonerated Monts.|$|E
50|$|One of {{its most}} {{striking}} features is the Chinook arch, which is a band of stationary stratus clouds caused by air rippling over the mountains due to orographic lifting. To those <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> it, <b>the</b> Chinook arch {{may look like a}} threatening storm cloud at times. However, they rarely produce rain or snow. They can also create stunning sunrises and sunsets.|$|R
50|$|The day {{he finally}} got back to South Carolina, McDew was walking to his dorm. In pain because of his {{previous}} beating, he decided to walk home though a park. Being <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> segregation, <b>the</b> park McDew walked through happened to only be open to white people on this particular day, which led to his third arrest in two days.|$|R

5|$|Long epic poetry was not {{a popular}} genre in North Korea before Mt. Paektu, {{but it was in}} the Soviet Union where Cho had immigrated from. Poema and Mayakovsky's prosody and poetry were also among Cho's {{influences}} that can be seen in Mt. Paektu. These Russian stylistic influences gave Mt. Paektu its peculiar characteristics that prompted mixed reactions from the North Korean public. For instance, some in the literature circles were <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> concept of a lyrical epic and thought of it as an improbable amalgam of genres, criticizing the work for being indistinguishable from ordinary prose. According to North Korean studies scholar Alzo David-West, the relatively favorable reaction to Mt. Paektu compared to some other literature testifies to North Korean readership being capable at being both a receptive and a dismissive audience.|$|E
5|$|On 7 October 1964, Vulcan B.2 XM601 crashed during {{overshoot}} from an asymmetric power practice approach at Coningsby. The copilot had executed the asymmetric {{power approach}} with two engines producing thrust and two at idle. He was being checked by the Squadron Commander, who was <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> aircraft. When he commenced the overshoot the copilot moved all the throttles to full power. The engines {{that had been}} producing power reached full power more quickly than the engines at idle and the resultant asymmetric thrust exceeded the available rudder authority, causing the aircraft to spin and crash. All the crew perished.|$|E
5|$|On March 7, 2016, Bevin {{released}} a video {{on social media}} claiming that House Democrats were not following through on their obligations to help craft the state budget. Legislators responded with a photo and statements that while Bevin was producing his film designed to chastise them, House leaders were in fact in committee meetings working out details of a budget proposal while Speaker Stumbo suggested the Governor was either <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> legislative process, or intended to deceive people. On March 12, House Democrats released their own budget, which sustained most of the cuts to executive agencies in Bevin's budget, but exempted public universities from any cuts. The Republican-controlled Senate countered with a proposal that hewed closely to Bevin's original budget.|$|E
50|$|In 1935, he {{held his}} first solo {{exhibition}} in Yerevan, Armenia. This attracted much attention among the Armenian intelligentsia, who were still <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> his work. <b>The</b> exhibition was a huge success. Lilya Brik wrote {{that it was an}} unexpected joy.|$|R
40|$|The role {{of surgery}} in the morbidly obese is {{becoming}} more prominent. There {{are a variety of}} surgical approaches which can be used and radiology plays a crucial role in post operative follow up, particularly in the management of complications. Many general radiologists remain <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> both <b>the</b> normal and abnormal appearances after bariatric surgery and this pictorial review aims to bridge this gap...|$|R
50|$|The Inzaghi era {{started off}} well - as {{it needed to}} - in the {{complexity}} of the Lega Pro. If you are <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> how <b>the</b> league works, there are 60 teams in this division split across three groups of 20 each, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> highest finisher in each group gaining one of three automatic spots in Serie B. If a team finishes below first, they play a long and convoluted playoff from which only one team gains promotion.|$|R
5|$|Sonic Team decided {{early on}} in the {{development}} process {{to reduce the number of}} characters present in the game, as well as to make Sonic the only playable character; this decision was taken to get more quality out of fewer characters. While it felt that these ideas combined with traditional Sonic gameplay was a good beginning, it also had to consider how to introduce newer gamers <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Sonic franchise to the series, and so the concept of the Werehog was born, in addition to exploring its own mythology and ideas for the story. Director Yoshihisa Hashimoto felt from the outset that there would be both praise and criticism, but hoped that long-term Sonic fans would understand and empathise with the ideas and direction the team had taken.|$|E
5|$|Sonic Unleashed began {{development}} in 2006 after {{the creation of}} its game engine, the Hedgehog Engine. The game was initially conceived as the sequel to Sonic Adventure 2, but the development team began to introduce enough new innovations that separated it from previous games, and it was renamed Unleashed. The Werehog gameplay was conceived to help introduce newer gamers <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Sonic franchise to the series. The game's existence was first brought to light when Sega trademarked the Unleashed name, and shortly after, images and a gameplay video were leaked {{to the public in}} March 2008. Three versions of the game were developed: one by Sonic Team for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, one by Dimps for the Wii and PlayStation 2, and one by Gameloft for mobile phones.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclusion}} of specific Final Fantasy characters {{was based on}} the opinions of both fans and staff. Another criterion for inclusion was whether the staff felt the characters would fit into the storyline and in the Kingdom Hearts universe. Initially, Nomura was hesitant to use characters he did not design, because he was <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> backstory of such characters. For Kingdom Hearts II, he changed his mind after receiving pressure from his staff. Throughout the development of the games, Nomura has often left certain events and connections between characters unexplained until the release of future games. Nomura does this because he feels that games should have room for fans to speculate and use their imagination. He has stated that with speculation, even though a game gets old, people can still be happy with it.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2017, Moore {{stated that}} he was <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> what <b>the</b> Dreamer program was. Later, in September 2017, Moore criticized Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which grants {{temporary}} stay to unauthorized immigrants brought to the United States as children. In an interview with Breitbart News, Moore {{stated that he}} is supportive of the RAISE ACT, along with supporting a significant and immediate reduction in legal immigration, arguing that immigrants hurt native-born Americans.|$|R
40|$|An {{accurate}} histopathological {{diagnosis of}} parasitic infections may elude experienced parasitologists and pathologists. The parasitologist is often unacquainted with parasites presented in cross-section 2 ̆ 7 and the pathologist is generally <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> parasitology.

A few capitalized words (given names, geographical place names) have been included. None {{of the words}} has the same meaning in Turkish and English. Because most people are <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> Turkish, <b>the</b> Turkish meaning of each word is given in parenthesis...|$|R
5|$|Throughout the march, the loyalist forces faced {{problems}} such as desertions, lack of discipline, illness, food shortages, and poor navigation. The march included several river crossings, which were made difficult {{by the lack of}} bridges, swollen rivers due to rain, as well as bogged down wagons and cannons. It was particularly difficult for the VOC forces, who were <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> terrain of the Javanese interior. Hurdt wanted to stay in the Solo River valley, and to continue the campaign in the following year. Amangkurat preferred to keep marching, and his opinion prevailed. As the loyalist forces marched eastwards, the rebel forces avoided major battle, but fought in skirmishes, and continued to endanger the loyalists' foragers and stragglers. The loyalists scoured the countryside to collect food, causing panic among its inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|As Ada reached North Queensland, the BoM issued cyclone {{warnings}} on {{a three-hour}} cycle, with more frequent bulletins occasionally released as needed. Flood warnings were issued for watersheds of susceptible rivers like the Pioneer and Connors. The bureau's post-storm {{assessment of the}} disaster revealed that local broadcasts of advisories were sometimes delayed by several hours or not made at all, and public awareness was generally inadequate. In a misguided attempt to quell panic, one radio station appended the BoM's warning with an unapproved message {{that there was no}} cause for alarm because of the cyclone's small size. Due to the unusual nature of the storm, including its delayed arrival in some areas, many residents criticised or disregarded forecasts. Additionally, many tourists in the region were <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> dangers of tropical cyclones. Findings from studies of the public response to Ada were used as the basis for upgraded warning systems and the introduction of more cyclone education campaigns; these initiatives were credited with saving lives and property in later storms such as Cyclone Althea in December 1971.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis {{was first}} {{described}} in 1782 by the French botanist Pierre Bulliard and still bears its original name. The starting date of fungal taxonomy {{had been set}} as January1, 1821, {{to coincide with the}} date of the works of the 'father of mycology', Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries, which meant the name required sanction by Fries (indicated in the name by a colon) to be considered valid, as Bulliard's work preceded this date. It was thus written Boletus edulis Bull.:Fr. A 1987 revision of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature set the starting date at May1, 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus' work, the Species Plantarum. Hence, the name no longer requires the ratification of Fries' authority. Early alternate names include Boletus solidus by English naturalist James Sowerby in 1809, and Gray's Leccinum edule. Gray's transfer of the species to Leccinum was later determined to be inconsistent with the rules of botanical nomenclature, and he apparently was <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> earlier works of Fries when he published his arrangement of bolete species.|$|E
50|$|In 1935, Yamagata in {{collaboration}} with Fujiya Hotel published We Japanese, a book about Japanese customs for English-Speakers <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> Japanese culture. <b>The</b> book became an instant hit with several editions released until 1950, which helped the company recover from the damages caused by the air raids on Japan during the war.|$|R
2500|$|Coinciding <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{release of}} the book and its {{surprising}} popularity, injuries related to BDSM and sex toy use spiked dramatically. In 2012, the year after the book was published, injuries requiring Emergency Room visits increased by over 50% from 2010 (the year before the book was published). This is speculated to be due to people <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> both <b>the</b> proper use of these toys and the safe practice of bondage and other [...] "kinky" [...] sexual fetishes attempting what they had read in the book.|$|R
