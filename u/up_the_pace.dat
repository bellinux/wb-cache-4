5|$|After {{the first}} pit stops, the Mercedes drivers had {{to manage their}} tyres in order to cover from a {{possible}} attack by Ferrari, who had an extra set of fresh tyres saved from qualifying. Rosberg however complained over the radio about Hamilton {{in front of him}} driving too slow, which caused him to back into the charging Ferraris. He was unable to risk driving too close behind Hamilton, because dispersed air {{from the back of the}} car was accelerating tyre degradation. Hamilton was therefore asked by the team to pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace.</b>|$|E
5|$|In June 1942, Heydrich {{was assassinated}} in Prague in an {{operation}} led by Jozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš, members of Czechoslovakia's army-in-exile who had been trained by the British Special Operations Executive. During the two funeral services, Himmler—the chief mourner—took charge of Heydrich's two young sons, and he gave the eulogy in Berlin. On 9 June, after discussions with Himmler and Karl Hermann Frank, Hitler ordered brutal reprisals for Heydrich's death. Over 13,000 people were arrested, and the village of Lidice was razed to the ground; its male inhabitants and all adults {{in the village of}} Ležáky were murdered. At least 1,300 people were executed by firing squads. Himmler took over leadership of the RSHA and stepped <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> of the killing of Jews in Aktion Reinhard (Operation Reinhard), named in Heydrich's honour. He ordered the Aktion Reinhard camps—the first extermination camps—to be constructed at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka.|$|E
5|$|When Odilo Globocnik made a {{surprise}} visit to Treblinka on 26 August 1942 with Christian Wirth and Wirth's adjutant from Bełżec, Josef Oberhauser, Eberl was dismissed on the spot. Among {{the reasons for}} dismissal were: incompetently disposing of {{the tens of thousands}} of dead bodies, using inefficient methods of killing, and not properly concealing the mass killing. Eberl was transferred to Berlin, closer to operational headquarters in Hitler's Chancellery, where the main architect of the Holocaust, Heinrich Himmler, had just stepped <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> of the programme. Globocnik assigned Wirth to remain in Treblinka temporarily to help clean up the camp. On 28 August 1942, Globocnik suspended deportations. He chose Franz Stangl, who had previously been the commandant of the Sobibór extermination camp, to assume command of the camp as Eberl's successor. Stangl had a reputation as a competent administrator with a good understanding of the project's objectives, and Globocnik trusted that he would be capable of resuming control.|$|E
50|$|In the men's race, fifteen runners {{reached the}} halfway point {{in a time of}} 1:06:11 hours (some minutes slower than {{previous}} years). Soon after, Mathew Kisorio <b>upped</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> and reduced <b>the</b> leading pack to himself, Matebo, Mutai, Chebet, Wesley Korir and Laban Korir. After 18 miles (29 km) Kisorio and Matebo had broken away and defending champion Mutai had pulled out of the race altogether.|$|R
50|$|The event opened {{dramatically}} as Estil fell at the start, causing a mass collision. Then the pack kept together almost until the end, with skiers continually trailing off {{as they could}} not keep <b>up</b> with <b>the</b> <b>pace.</b> Eventually, five men came into the finishing straight together, after Anders Södergren of Sweden had tried to pull away on the final lap. However, Södergren could not keep <b>up</b> with <b>the</b> <b>pace,</b> and Russian Yevgeny Dementyev pulled away to defeat the defending Olympic champion Estil and win Russia's first gold medal of the Games.|$|R

5|$|The Brooklyn native {{began the}} busier fighter, using the jab {{and trying to}} land uppercuts {{for the first two}} rounds, while Matthysse worked on the body. In round three, a clash of heads opened a cut outside of the left eye of Judah. Matthysse {{displayed}} more aggression and became the aggressor in the third and the fourth round and Judah switched to a defensive tactic. In the next two rounds, the American boxer picked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace,</b> beginning to land more combinations. The seventh round was less active but in the eight, Judah landed some hard right counter shots. Judah continued to box throughout the ninth round but Matthysse began to show more power in the tenth, focusing on the head of his opponent and knocking down the American boxer after a hard right hand to the jaw. Judah got up but he was hurt, and the Argentine fighter tried to press the attack after the knockdown. However, Judah held and worked on the defensive and managed to finish the bout. Two judges scored the fight 114–113 for Judah, while the other judge scored it 114–113 for Matthysse.|$|E

The EP was produced after Powderfinger entered a hiatus, and several of its band members sought work with side projects. Following the release of Pick <b>Up</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pace,</b> The Predators embarked on a minor tour around Australia, including a performance at Splendour in the Grass, before officially going on hiatus, around the time Powderfinger reformed.|$|E

50|$|The {{round in}} Canada was {{a battle between}} the Schumacher brothers, with Michael taking pole and {{maintaining}} his lead at the first corner. Ralf, however, kept up with him, and when his brother pitted, <b>upped</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> {{with a string of}} quick laps, and came out five seconds ahead. Ralf cruised to victory, with his brother making it the first time ever that brothers have finished 1-2 in a race, and Häkkinen finished third, his first podium of the season. Coulthard was set for third, but retired when his engine failed 15 laps from the finish.|$|R
25|$|Durham {{continued}} their fine {{start to the}} season with a comfortable win at Chester-le-Street. They started slowly, making only 60 (for no loss) after 20 overs. But helped by Mike Hussey they picked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace,</b> ending on 256 for 4. Yorkshire's reply started quicker, but the Dynamos kept taking wickets, finally dismissing the Phoenix for 205. Paul Collingwood and Gareth Breese took 3 each.|$|E
25|$|Stableford {{can have}} {{the added benefit of}} {{speeding}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> of play, as once it is no longer possible to score a point, players do not have to complete the hole but can simply pick up their ball and proceed to the next hole. It is a popular form of the game, especially at club level and particularly in the United Kingdom, as it is still possible to record a competitive score despite having the occasional bad hole.|$|E
25|$|The {{fruits of}} {{liberalisation}} reached their peak in 2006, when India recorded its highest GDP {{growth rate of}} 9.6%. With this, India became the second fastest growing major economy in the world, next only to China. The growth rate has slowed significantly {{in the first half}} of 2012. An Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report states that the average growth rate 7.5% will double the average income in a decade, and more reforms would speed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace.</b> The economy then rebounded to 7.3% growth in 2014–15.|$|E

50|$|For Pegoraro, {{fourth in}} the {{championship}} is perhaps disappointing {{but it was his}} first season in 250 International for several years as the RMR Marron Excavations Anderson-Rotax team built up this year to challenge Stockman Superkarts.

25|$|Both teams {{got off to}} a {{slow start}} and were tied at 15 after the first quarter, setting a record-low for {{combined}} score (30) in the first quarter of an NBA Finals game. The Lakers picked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> in the 2nd quarter, but Rashard Lewis kept the Magic in the game, scoring 18 of the team's 20 points in the quarter, including the final 16, on his way to a playoff career-high and Finals franchise-high 34 points for the game. The Magic outscored the Lakers in the 3rd quarter to take a 2-point lead in the 4th.|$|E
25|$|Bisping {{went on to}} face Alan Belcher on 27 April 2013 at UFC 159. In {{the first}} round Bisping managed to out-box his {{opponent}} and score a brief trip take-down, in addition to landing a very accurate, clean and extremely solid knee. Bisping then noticeably stepped <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> of the fight in round 2, landing some heavy kicks and multiple combinations of solid punches. The fight was then stopped at 4:29 of round 3 as Bisping inadvertently poked Belcher in the eye, rendering Belcher unable to continue. Bisping won the bout via unanimous technical decision.|$|E
25|$|The Predators {{consist of}} the three {{original}} Powderfinger members; Ian Haug (guitar), John Collins (bass), and Steven Bishop (drums, vocals), and thus Pick <b>Up</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pace</b> {{was influenced by the}} band's early work. As the three had attended school together, the music on the EP flowed easily. According to Haug, the trio had been discussing the possibility of reuniting for a long time. Ross McLennan, the fourth Predators member, only played drums on live appearances, to allow Bishop to focus on singing. The EP was recorded at Haug's Airlock Studios in the band's home town, Brisbane, with songs first released to radio on 17 May 2006.|$|E

25|$|The 2011 6 Hours of Silverstone, {{witnessed}} a nose-to-tail fight between the Audi R18 of Bernhard and Fässler and the Peugeot 908 of Sébastien Bourdais and Simon Pagenaud, but was temporarily finished after a spin by Bernhard. A conservative drive from Pagenaud saw Fässler {{close the gap}} right down again and in fact jump into the lead. Pagenaud picked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> and the two cars were on each other's tails {{until the end of}} the fourth hour when damaged rear bodywork needed replacing on the Audi. This gave the Peugeot a one-minute advantage that it did not give up. Third was the OAK Racing's Pescarolo 01 piloted by Olivier Pla and Alexandre Prémat.|$|E
25|$|In December 2009, it was {{reported}} that company was struggling to repay its debts of 1.1 billion euros. The fiscal year ending in August resulted in an operating loss, and the company had to re-negotiate with its 15 funding banks debt repayment schedules for the years 2009–2011. The banks took a more controlling role in the company: it could no longer pay dividends, make investments, or sign new contracts without its creditors' approval. Tallink also had to pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> in debt repayments if conditions were to improve, and had to look for options to sell or rent some of its ships. Most of its debts were incurred for purchasing Silja Line for 470 million and Superfast Ferries for 310 million euros.|$|E
25|$|The {{match against}} Lipscomb of the Atlantic Sun Conference was a contest of {{defenses}} {{with the two}} squads managing to get off only three shots in the first half. The Cougars picked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> in the second half, but the Bisons' keeper made four of his six saves to hold the home team scoreless. SIUE's defense turned away everything sent at them, but made a bad habit of clearing the ball over the end line to set up Lipscomb corner kicks. The game was still scoreless with {{less than two minutes}} remaining in the second extra period when the Bisons set up for their eighth corner of the game. Cougar defenders turned away two Lipscomb headers, but the final clearance rebounded off a charging Bisons forward, falling into the net past a stunned Dal Santo.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Jayasuriya {{was dropped}} twice, but survived {{and went on}} to make 67 before being run out {{attempting}} a difficult second run. By that time, however, he had steadied the ship with Jayawardene, and Arnold helped to <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> - the score being 122 for 4 after 26 overs, when Jayasuriya was out. It did not matter, as Arnold and Jayawardene treated the spinners with disdain, plundering 125 runs in 20 overs and accelerating the scoring to a point where India could not keep up. Nehra tried, and his variations gave him more wickets - he finished with the second six-wicket-haul of his career, the first coming against England in the 2003 World Cup, but a returning Vaas helped himself to 18 not out and upped the total to 281 for 9. An interesting feature of the scorecard was that no Indian bowler apart from Nehra got wickets - six for him, the other three were run outs.|$|E
25|$|Fanny Blankers-Koen thereby {{became the}} first Dutch athlete to win an Olympic title in athletics, but she was more {{concerned}} with her next event, the 80m hurdles. Her chief opponent was Maureen Gardner, also coached by Blankers-Koen's husband and who had equalled Blankers's world record prior to the Games, and would be running for her home crowd. Both athletes made the final, in which Blankers-Koen {{got off to a}} bad start (she would later claim she thought there had been a false start). She picked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> quickly, but was unable to shake off Gardner, who kept close until the finish line, and the two finished almost simultaneously. When the British national anthem was played, the crowd in Wembley Stadium cheered, and Blankers-Koen briefly thought she had been beaten. However, the anthem was played in honour of the British royal family, which entered the stadium at that time. Examination of the finish photo clearly showed that not Gardner, but Blankers-Koen had won, although both received the same time (11.2s).|$|E

Newly appointed team captain Sheldon Keefe led the entire OHL in scoring, winning the Eddie Powers Memorial Trophy and the Jim Mahon Memorial Trophy for his 48 goals and 73 assists on the season. Denis Shvidki, Mike Jefferson and Michael Henrich also finished in the top-twenty in scoring that year with 106, 87, and 86 points respectively. The Colts also received secondary scoring from the likes of rookie Blaine Down and centre Matt Dzieduszycki. In the playoffs the Colts faced the North Bay Centennials in the conference quarter finals, winning the series four games to two. In the next round they faced the Sudbury Wolves, winning that series four games to three. In their first trip to the eastern conference finals the Colts faced the Belleville Bulls whom they quickly defeated in 5 games, winning their first Bobby Orr Trophy. This meant that the Colts would face the Plymouth Whalers, a team who had won the Hamilton Spectator Trophy for finishing first in the league. The Colts defeated the Whalers in a seven-game series, winning the J. Ross Robertson Cup and advancing to the Memorial Cup finals in Halifax, Nova Scotia.|$|E
