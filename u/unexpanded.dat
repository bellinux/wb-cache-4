The white form of A.phalloides may be mistaken for edible species of Agaricus, especially the young fruitbodies whose <b>unexpanded</b> caps conceal the telltale white gills; all mature species of Agaricus have dark-colored gills.|$|E
5|$|Lunar Jetman was Ultimate Play the Game's {{first game}} to require 48K of RAM — all {{previous}} productions had run on <b>unexpanded</b> 16K models. The game {{was written by}} Chris Stamper with graphics designed by Tim Stamper. It was met with critical acclaim upon release, with praise mostly directed at its addictive gameplay and wide range of colours. The game {{was followed by a}} third episode, , released for the NES in 1990. It was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E

The resulting output is then displayed by the octal dump command od. At the second prompt, the same echo output is sent directly through the od command. As {{can be seen by}} comparing the two, the <b>unexpand</b> program converts sequences of eight spaces into single tabs (printed as '\t').|$|R

25|$|Geofoam is {{a product}} created by a {{polymeric}} expansion process of polystyrene resulting in a “foam” consisting of many closed, but gas-filled, cells. The skeletal nature of the cell walls is the <b>unexpanded</b> polymeric material. The resulting product is generally {{in the form of}} large, but extremely light, blocks which are stacked side-by-side providing lightweight fill in numerous applications.|$|E
25|$|Self-expandable {{metallic}} stents are cylindrical in shape, and are devised in {{a number}} of diameters and lengths to suit the application in question. They typically consist of cross-hatched, braided or interconnecting rows of metal that are assembled into a tube-like structure. SEMS, when <b>unexpanded,</b> are small enough to fit through the channel of an endoscope, which is meant for delivery of devices for therapeutic endoscopy. They expand through a deployment device which is placed {{at the end of the}} SEMS, and are held in place against the wall of the luminal surface by friction.|$|E
25|$|The world {{demand for}} sugar {{is the primary}} driver of {{sugarcane}} agriculture. Cane accounts for 80% of sugar produced; {{most of the rest}} is made from sugar beets. Sugarcane predominantly grows in the tropical and subtropical regions (sugar beets grow in colder temperate regions). Other than sugar, products derived from sugarcane include falernum, molasses, rum, cachaça (a traditional spirit from Brazil), bagasse, and ethanol. In some regions, people use sugarcane reeds to make pens, mats, screens, and thatch. The young, <b>unexpanded</b> inflorescence of tebu telor is eaten raw, steamed, or toasted, and prepared in various ways in certain island communities of Indonesia.|$|E
500|$|Atic Atac is an arcade-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Ultimate Play the Game, released for the ZX Spectrum and the BBC Micro in 1983. The game takes place within a castle in which the player must seek out the [...] "Golden Key of ACG" [...] through unlocking doors and avoiding enemies. It was Ultimate's second game to require 48K of RAM; most of their previous games for the Spectrum ran on <b>unexpanded</b> 16K models.|$|E
500|$|The cap of {{the fruit}} body is thin and membranous, {{measuring}} [...] in diameter. It has a convex shape slightly depressed in the center, conspicuous furrows in an outline of the gills, and scalloped edges. Young, <b>unexpanded</b> caps are yellowish brown; as the cap expands, the color lightens to whitish or light pinkish-white, often with a darker, sometimes brown center. The variety fusca has brown caps. [...] The white or slightly yellowish flesh is very thin, reaching about 0.25–1.5mm thick in {{the central part of}} the cap, and even thinner at the margin.|$|E
500|$|The <b>unexpanded</b> ZX81's tiny memory {{presents}} {{a major challenge}} to programmers. Simply displaying a full screen takes up to 793bytes, the system variables take up another 125bytes, and the program, input buffer and stacks need more memory on top of that. Nonetheless, ingenious programmers are able to achieve a surprising amount with just 1KB. One notable example is 1K ZX Chess by David Horne, which manages to include most {{of the rules of}} chess into only 672 bytes. The ZX81 conserves its memory to a certain extent by representing entire BASIC commands as one-byte tokens, stored as individual [...] "characters" [...] in {{the upper reaches of the}} machine's unique (non-ASCII) character set.|$|E
500|$|Ampelosaurus is {{also known}} from a pubis, about [...] long. It has a strong distal expansion, {{that is similar to}} a {{titanosaur}} from Brazil, and a large foramen. Contrary to the South American titanosaurs, the ilium does not have an expansion on the side. The ischium, known from a shaft, is <b>unexpanded</b> distally and very well developed. It is also very flat. An incomplete radius {{is also known}}. It lacks the proximal and distal ends, and possesses a very prominent ridge along it. The largest and best-preserved specimens are both ulnas. The right ulna has a total length of [...] The right ulna is small and slender, is missing an olecranon, and has a well-marked ridge. The left ulna is larger, with a length of [...] The ulna has a deep radial fossa.|$|E
500|$|The largest known Tarbosaurus skull is {{more than}} [...] long, larger than all other tyrannosaurids except Tyrannosaurus. The skull was tall, like that of Tyrannosaurus, but not as wide, {{especially}} towards the rear. The <b>unexpanded</b> rear of the skull meant that Tarbosaurus eyes did not face directly forwards, suggesting that it lacked the binocular vision of Tyrannosaurus. Large fenestrae (openings) in the skull reduced its weight. Between 58 and 64 teeth lined its jaws, slightly more than in Tyrannosaurus but fewer than in smaller tyrannosaurids like Gorgosaurus and Alioramus. Most of its teeth were oval in cross section, although {{the teeth of the}} premaxilla {{at the tip of the}} upper jaw had a D-shaped cross section. This heterodonty is characteristic of the family. The longest teeth were in the maxilla (upper jaw bone), with crowns up to 85 millimeters (3.3 in) long. In the lower jaw, a ridge on the outer surface of the angular bone articulated with the rear of the dentary bone, creating a locking mechanism unique to Tarbosaurus and Alioramus. Other tyrannosaurids lacked this ridge and had more flexibility in the lower jaw.|$|E
500|$|The gills appear closely spaced in <b>unexpanded</b> caps, {{but usually}} more distant in old individuals. Between 8 and 16 gills extend from the margin to the stipe; there are {{additionally}} {{one or two}} tiers of small gills (lamellulae) that do not reach fully from the margin to the stipe. The gills are narrow but become [...] (swelling in the middle) and sometimes very broad in age, and are attached by a line or are very narrowly adnate. Sometimes the gills split away from the stipe while remaining attached to each other; in this way they form a collar around the stipe. Gills are pale gray but soon become whitish, with even edges. The stipe is [...] long, 0.5–1mm thick, and, above {{the level of the}} flat circular disc at the base, is equal in width throughout. The stipe is covered with fine white scattered fibrils, or is delicately [...] (as if covered with a fine white powder), but it later becomes smooth. Its color is bluish-gray when fresh but soon it fades to gray. The basal disc is grooved (from gill impressions) and pruinose or covered with fine minute hairs, but soon becomes smooth. The insubstantial fruit bodies are considered inedible.|$|E

60|$|We shall, also, {{presently}} {{see that}} the short-styled plants produce more seed than the long-styled. It is remarkable, according to Professor Oliver, that the ovules in the <b>unexpanded</b> and unimpregnated flowers of the latter are considerably larger {{than those of the}} short-styled flowers (1/3. 'Natural History Review' July 1862 page 237.); and this I suppose is connected with the long-styled flowers producing fewer seeds, so that the ovules have more space and nourishment for rapid development.|$|E
60|$|Above Simonbong, {{the path}} up Tonglo is little frequented: {{it is one}} of the many routes between Nepal and Sikkim, which cross the Singalelah spur of Kinchinjunga at various {{elevations}} between 7000 and 15,000 feet. As usual, the track runs along ridges, wherever these are to be found, very steep, and narrow at the top, through deep humid forests of oaks and Magnolias, many laurels, both Tetranthera and Cinnamomum, one species of the latter ascending to 8,500 feet, and one of Tetranthera to 9000. Chesnut and walnut here appeared, with some leguminous trees, which however did not ascend to 6000 feet. Scarlet flowers of Vaccinium serpens, an epiphytical species, were strewed about, and the great blossoms of Rhododendron Dalhousiae and of a Magnolia (Talaunaa Hodgsoni) lay together on the ground. The latter forms a large tree, with very dense foliage, and deep shining green leaves, a foot to eighteen inches long. Most of its flowers drop <b>unexpanded</b> from the tree, and diffuse a very aromatic smell; they are nearly as large as the fist, the outer petals purple, the inner pure white.|$|E
6000|$|There he sits, {{twiddling}} his feelers (a substitute, it seems, with crustacea for biting their nails {{when they}} are puzzled), and by no means lovely to look on in vulgar eyes; - about the bigness of a man's fist; a round-bodied, spindle-shanked, crusty, prickly, dirty fellow, with a villanous squint, too, in those little bony eyes, which never look for a moment both the same way. Never mind: many a man of genius is ungainly enough; and Nature, if you will observe, {{as if to make}} up to him for his uncomeliness, has arrayed him as Solomon in all his glory never was arrayed, and so fulfilled one of the proposals of old Fourier - that scavengers, chimney- sweeps, and other workers in disgusting employments, should be rewarded for their self-sacrifice in behalf of the public weal by some peculiar badge of honour, or laurel crown. Not that his crown, like those of the old Greek games, is a mere useless badge; on the contrary, his robe of state is composed of his fellow- servants. His whole back is covered with a little grey forest of branching hairs, fine as a spider's web, each branchlet carrying its little pearly ringed club, each club its rose-coloured polype, like (to quote Mr. Gosse's comparison) the <b>unexpanded</b> birds of the acacia.

60|$|But as to a {{woman of}} sense and spirit, the admiration of even the noblest and most gifted man, is esteemed as nothing, so long as she remains {{conscious}} of possessing no directly influencing and practical sorcery over his soul; and as notwithstanding all his intellectual superiority to his mother, Pierre, through the unavoidable weakness of inexperienced and <b>unexpanded</b> youth, was strangely docile to the maternal tuitions in nearly all the things which thus far had any ways interested or affected him; therefore it was, that to Mary Glendinning this reverence of Pierre was invested with all the proudest delights and witcheries of self-complacency, which {{it is possible for}} the most conquering virgin to feel. Still more. That nameless and infinitely delicate aroma of inexpressible tenderness and attentiveness which, in every refined and honorable attachment, is cotemporary with the courtship, and precedes the final banns and the rite; but which, like the bouquet of the costliest German wines, too often evaporates upon pouring love out to drink, in the disenchanting glasses of the matrimonial days and nights; this highest and airiest thing in the whole compass of the experience of our mortal life; this heavenly evanescence--still further etherealized in the filial breast--was for Mary Glendinning, now not very far from her grand climacteric, miraculously revived in the courteous lover-like adoration of Pierre.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the first}} place, then, I {{would suggest that}} they might {{possibly}} learn something from them. It will not be denied by anybody, that originality is a valuable element in human affairs. There is always need of persons not only to discover new truths, and point out when what were once truths are true no longer, but also to commence new practices, and set the example of more enlightened conduct, and better taste and sense in human life. This cannot well be gainsaid by anybody who {{does not believe that}} the world has already attained perfection in all its ways and practices. It is true that this benefit is not capable of being rendered by everybody alike: there are but few persons, in comparison with the whole of mankind, whose experiments, if adopted by others, would be likely to be any improvement on established practice. But these few are the salt of the earth; without them, human life would become a stagnant pool. Not only is it they who introduce good things which did not before exist; it is they who keep the life in those which already existed. If there were nothing new to be done, would human intellect cease to be necessary? Would it be a reason why those who do the old things should forget why they are done, and do them like cattle, not like human beings? There is only too great a tendency in the best beliefs and practices to degenerate into the mechanical; and unless there were a succession of persons whose ever-recurring originality prevents the grounds of those beliefs and practices from becoming merely traditional, such dead matter would not resist the smallest shock from anything really alive, {{and there would be no}} reason why civilisation should not die out, as in the Byzantine Empire. Persons of genius, it is true, are, and are always likely to be, a small minority; but in order to have them, it is necessary to preserve the soil in which they grow. Genius can only breathe freely in an atmosphere of freedom. Persons of genius are, ex vi termini, more individual than any other people--less capable, consequently, of fitting themselves, without hurtful compression, into any of the small number of moulds which society provides in order to save its members the trouble of forming their own character. If from timidity they consent to be forced into one of these moulds, and to let all that part of themselves which cannot expand under the pressure remain <b>unexpanded,</b> society will be little the better for their genius. If they are of a strong character, and break their fetters, they become a mark for the society which has not succeeded in reducing them to commonplace, to point at with solemn warning as [...] "wild," [...] "erratic," [...] and the like; much as if one should complain of the Niagara river for not flowing smoothly between its banks like a Dutch canal.|$|E
