The west end of the slide mass broke away from the dam near station 27+00 and the core pool water rapidly poured out of the breach that was created in the shell. Portions of the core in the still-stable portion of the dam continued to slump into the hole created by the loss of the slide mass. One construction supervisor was backing his car away from the advancing scarp to the west along the beach to avoid the slumping and noted that the small scarp in the core was advancing to the west at a speed equal to his own (approximately 10 mph (16 km/h)).|$|E

The diaphragm is made of polyvinylchloride (PVC) geomembrane and has a zigzag location. Computations were conducted with the finite element method. A thin geomembrane was modeled by rod-shaped finite elements. Computations showed that the diaphragm made of geomembrane is a sufficiently safe seepage-control element: there are small tensile stresses on its individual sections. The geomembrane damage may occur in it only in the part anchored to the <b>upstream</b> <b>shell.</b> Considerable tensile stresses appear in anchors which are comparable with the geomembrane tensile strength. If the geomembrane is made of PVC, there will be a margin of safety.

40|$|International audienceMeasured {{displacements}} in the <b>upstream</b> <b>shell</b> of rockfill dams {{show some}} settlements which can reach {{a few meters}} with water levels changes, especially during the first impounding, whereas downstream displacements are smaller. Complementary phenomena are responsible for rockfill collapse due to wetting. Here we numerically investigate the effects of buoyancy forces and the decrease in the coefficient of friction with water on a rockfill column maintained by vertical rigid walls and progressively filled with water. Numerical simulations of the settlements of the rockfill column, using the Contact Dynamics method, are presented. Buoyancy forces seem to have only a negligible influence on the granular pile. Decrease in the friction angle of the rock with water induces rearrangements of the medium, all the more as the decrease is significant. These dynamic rearrangements exhibit an irregular temporal evolution of the granular medium which can be characterized by a phenomenon of local "crisis". Analysis of the settlements shows that these two combined effects are not the major cause of the settlements observed in rockfill dams and that they cannot in particular explain the settlements...|$|E

The Rumei {{core wall}} {{rockfill}} dam hydropower station is in Lancang River in the Mangkang county of the Tibet autonomous region with maximum height of 315 m and crest length of 666. 2 m.

The results showed that the free surface of the upstream dam shell rockfill body dropping fast than the water level dropping speed of the reservoir. The seepage gradient of the <b>upstream</b> <b>shell</b> is very small, which will not cause adverse effect on the upstream dam slope stability. The free surface of the downstream dam shell rockfill body changes little, which will not cause adverse effect on the downstream of the dam slope stability. As the water level falls, the free surface of the core wall dropping speed is slow, far less than the water dropping speed of the reservoir. In the process of emptying reservoir, the free surface of the core wall remains in a high position, which should cause enough attention...|$|E
40|$|A sedimentological and geochronological {{approach}} {{is taken to}} determine {{the impact of the}} Holocene sea level rise on the Shoalhaven River, southeastern New South Wales. Sea level peaked at + 1 to 1. 5 m by ∼ 7. 8 ka, before declining slowly to present elevation at 2 ka. Whilst the coastal response to these fluctuations is well established, the question remains as to how far upstream these influences are recorded in the sedimentary record. Empirical evidence of fluvial impact of sea level rise lags behind well constrained information about the magnitude and timing of these events. Southeastern Australia, being tectonically stable and lacking glaciation throughout the Quaternary, is an ideal location to obtain evidence for fluvial responses to sea level rise. Base level is a key parameter to which the fluvial system adjusts, thus relative changes in sea level force a response from river systems. In order to maintain equilibrium, channels adjust their planform in response to base level change. However planform adjustment is restricted by the confinement of many coastal rivers in southeastern Australia. Whilst estuarine facies were identified at Wogomia, 35 km from the current mouth of the Shoalhaven River, they appear to be reworked deposits from higher in the system, although they have not been identified beyond the bedrock confines immediately <b>upstream.</b> <b>Shell</b> fragments, dated at 7. 38 ± 0. 045 kcal yr BP, were retrieved from ∼ 2 m below the current low flow water level with at least 4 m of similar sediment above, and 8 m below, overlying Pleistocene basement.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the results of the {{numerical}} analysis of the stress-strain state of a 50 m high earthfill cofferdam. A geocomposite membrane (geo-membrane and geotextile layers) in its upper part (20 m) serves as a seepage control element. The grout curtain is installed in {{the lower part of the}} cofferdam and in the foundation. The cofferdam design implements the idea of using riprap to reduce the weight of the geocomposite membrane. The analysis proves that the high weight of the membrane considerably worsens the stress state of both the membrane and the whole dam. First of all, the load causes additional deflection of the membrane and consequently increases tensile stresses inside it. Second, due to the low value of the friction coefficient (approximately 0. 3 0. 4) in the point of contact between the geocomposite membrane and soil the dam <b>upstream</b> <b>shell</b> may slide down along the geocomposite membrane. Additional dam displacements may cause considerable tensile forces in the geomembrane. Their maximum values are comparable to the strength of the polymer material used for the manufacturing of the membrane. Any rupture of the membrane and geotextile layers may be expected. The analysis proves that it is necessary to get compensators in the polymer membrane allowing for the extension of the membrane absent of any tensile forces. The analysis proves that the geocomposite membrane does not affect the stressstrain state of the earth fill due to its small thickness. Non-linear effects of “earth – geomembrane” contacts are to be taken into account, because tensile forces appear inside geo-membranes due to the presence of friction forces. Рассмотрены результаты численного исследования напряженно-деформированного состояния конструкции грунтовой перемычки высотой 50 м, в которой противофильтрационным элементом является геокомпозитный экран (геомембрана и слои геотекстиля). Показано, что из-за низкого коэффициента трения на контакте геокомпозитного экрана с грунтом возможно оползание верховой призмы плотины по экрану. За счет этого в геомембране можно ожидать появления значительных растягивающих усилий, сопоставимых с прочностью полимерного материала. Устройство тяжелой пригрузки экрана грунтом неблагоприятно сказывается на надежности геомембраны.

40|$|Introduction: Cracking {{of earth}} dams is a {{one of the}} main threat causes of {{stability}} of embankment dams. In this research by modeling of the behavior of an embankment dam and employing conditions of the earthquake, the reasons of cracking were inspected using by modeling of earth dam behavior. Based on the literature, {{one of the main}} causes of dam failures is sliding and cracking of the dam structure during earthquake. Localized liquefaction of foundation soils was one of the causes of the observed post-earthquake distress within these dams. Material and Methods: In order to study the causes and the results of crack on earth dams, Mahmoodabad earthen dam with a height of 19 m, is located in Zanjan province, northwest of Iran, which suffered a longitudinal crack on the crest and slight sliding of the upstream slope due to 2001 Avaj earthquake was studied. This dam has faced earthquake two times with an interval of two years. During the first earthquake with the magnitude about 6. 6 in Richter scale small longitudinal cracks had created on the crest. The developed cracks had been repaired by injecting the cement and then has been hidden by passing the time. After the second earthquake with the magnitude about 6. 5 in Richter scale the hidden cracks had been appeared again and the slight movement of the upper slopes of dam reported. Based on the site investigation and documented information about dam, including maps and parameter data, the behavior of the dam has modeled by using Plaxis as a finite element model. In order to check the accuracy of the design of dam, the stability analysis has been conducted using by Xslope as a limit equilibrium model. The foundation conditions and the Geotechnical properties of the layer beneath the dam has been inspected by open excavation. Results and Discussion: Underground investigation about Geotechnical properties of dam foundation has showed that there is a thin sandy layer confined in alluvium material of the river base beneath the dam structure. In fact, this layer has not been considered in the analysis as well in design. Because of fully saturated condition of this layer in an operation period of dam it might subjected to liquefaction during the happening of the earthquake. Evaluation of liquefaction potential of this layer based on Seed and Idriss (1971) diagram showed probability of this phenomenon. To prove this hypothesis, the stability analysis had been conducted in two different conditions by including the thin sandy layer and without considering the mentioned layer. The analysis showed in the case of absence of sandy layer the required safety factor was satisfied, but including the sandy layer leads cause the safety factor dropped to 0. 84 that means accruing of liquefaction in the thin layer would lead to structural instability of the studied dam. The simulation of the behavior of dam by employing the accrued earthquake acceleration confirmed the liquefaction has been accrued in the thin sandy layer. The results of finite element simulation showed the depth of the cracks on the crest is about 2 meters and also the upstream slope has slipped about 81 mm to the reservoir of the dam. These results was consistent with the observed values. To overcome the next risks, also to repair the damaged parts of the dam, 3 different methods had been proposed. The curing technics was deploying of the reservoir and removing of the damage part of the dam and as well the thin sandy layer and reconstructed that part of dam, Deploying of reservoir of the dam and adjusting the slope of the upper shoulder to stable condition and at least repairing the developed cracks by injecting cement slurry and tolerate the current condition without imposition any additional costs to the project. The third method has been selected, but for any probable risky condition monitoring of the dam has been advised. Conclusion: Based on the overall results of the investigations, it was concluded that cracking and sliding of <b>upstream</b> <b>shell</b> is mainly due to the presence of a loose, fine sandy layer under the base of the dam which was liquefied during the earthquakes. In order to overcome the problem, one of the three offered solutions, including modification of cracks by injecting cement slurry, was applied and after roughly 9 years, the provided reports confirmed the adequacy of the applied solution...|$|E
40|$|The Clay {{core wall}} sand dams are mostly {{constructed}} on the tremendously thick covering layers with the base built with gravelly coarse sand and the {{upstream and downstream}} built with sanded shell into which gravelly coarse sand by manpower. The structures of these dams are generally loose and are presumably thereby considered not {{to meet the requirements}} against earthquake. In order to perform further safety analysis and liquefaction judgment with these dams in relation to their anti-seismic capacity, a typical dam with clay core and sanded shell was chosen and experiments were carried out to observe the dynamic behaviors of the dam, including the dynamic strength, the dynamic deformation and the dynamic pore pressure of the dam base and its <b>upstream</b> sanded <b>shell.</b> The results showed that the vibration stress ratio of gravelly coarse sand decreased with the increment in vibration frequency and increased with the increment in consolidation ratio, that the elastic modulus of gravelly coarse sand decreased with the increment in strain, and that the damping ratio of gravelly coarse sand increased with the increment in strain. In conclusion, the denser the dam material is, the better the anti- seismic behavior is, the sand used in the dam is non-linear in nature, The model of vibration pore water pressure growth is characterized by simplicity in expression, convenience in application, and being able to used in widespread way, etc. It reveals what inherent in the relationship of the increment of residual pore pressure with multiple factors, and hence can be used in the dynamic analysis of effective stress.
