Other similarly sized grebes are very distinct in plumage, i.e. the <b>eared</b> <b>grebe</b> and horned grebe. Both species bear much more colorful breeding plumage, with rufous sides, golden crests {{along the side of the}} head against contrasting slaty color (also a rufous neck in the horned); while in winter, both the eared and horned grebes are pied with slaty and cream color and have red eyes.|$|R
50|$|Frank Lake {{is located}} in the foothills fescue prairie ecoregion. The lake is a hemi-marsh, which means it roughly has the same area of open water as there is {{emergent}} vegetation. Vegetation includes mostly hardstem bulrush, sago pondweed, Richardson's pondweed, and northern waterfmilfoil. The lake and its surrounding upland areas attracts many species of birds. Waterfowl and shorebirds and other birds use the lake for staging during migration, and nesting. Some birds that can be seen here include: tundra swan, trumpeter swan, Canada goose, northern pintail, Franklin's gull, ring-billed gull, California gull, common tern, short-eared owl, <b>eared</b> <b>grebe,</b> marbled godwit, long-billed dowitcher, black-crowned night-heron, and black-necked stilt.

Shorebirds such as gulls, sandpipers and pelicans are at home in the salty environment, as well as 158 other species.There is a breeding population of snowy plover.The wetlands is a duck breeding concentration area, with mallards by far the most common, but good numbers of pintail and green-winged teal also visiting.|$|R
5|$|The high {{salinity}} {{in parts}} of the lake makes them uninhabitable for all but a few species, including brine shrimp, brine flies, and several forms of algae. The brine flies have an estimated population of over one hundred billion and serve as the main source of food for many of the birds which migrate to the lake. However, the fresh- and salt-water wetlands along the eastern and northern edges of the Great Salt Lake provide critical habitat for millions of migratory shorebirds and waterfowl in western North America. These marshes account for approximately 75% of the wetlands in Utah. Some of the birds that depend on these marshes include: Wilson's phalarope, red-necked phalarope, American avocet, black-necked stilt, marbled godwit, snowy plover, western sandpiper, long-billed dowitcher, tundra swan, American white pelican, white-faced ibis, California gull, <b>eared</b> <b>grebe,</b> peregrine falcon, bald eagle, plus large populations of various ducks and geese.|$|R
40|$|All {{species of}} loons, grebes, and auks are monogamous, with adults forming strong pair bonds that are {{established}} or reestablished each year, probably {{during the spring}} prenesting period. The extent of remating by birds mated the previous year in these groups is still largely undocumented, though at least in alcids it is fairly high, given the relatively long life-spans and the tendencies of the birds to return year after year to essentially the same territory and sometimes to the same nest site. Such conditions would promote reestablishment of contracts between previously paired birds, since it is not believed that in these birds pair or family units normally remain intact through the winter.

40|$|Graduation date: 1938 A {{water bird}} census was taken at three points on Upper Klamath Lake at weekly {{intervals}} extending {{over a period}} from September 9, 1936 to May 29, 1937. A total of 24, 319 birds was recorded in field records and included thirty-two species. Totals of birds by weekly field trips show the following maxima: October 3 produced by pintail, December 24 produced by olden eye, January 16 by ruddy and olden eye, March 6 by ruddy, and May 1 by greater scaup together with western and <b>eared</b> <b>grebe.</b> During the winter months while the lake is frozen over, the birds are concentrated in open water near hot springs or where a strong water current is present. They consist of bottom feeding or diving birds during this time; principally meranser, bufflehead, pied-billed grebe, ruddy, golden eye, coot and greater scaup. The fall migrants consisted largely of widgeons while the spring influx was composed mostly of greater scaup, western an <b>eared</b> <b>grebe.</b> The most abundant species were the ruddy, golden eye, widgeon, coot and greater scaup, constituting 23 %, 21 %, 16 %, 11 % and 10 % respectively {{of the total number}} of all birds observed. In frequency of appearance in field records, the greater scaup and coot were recorded on more than 80 % of the field trips while the ruddy and golden eye were present in from 70 % to 80 % of the trips. Availability of feeding areas appears to be the principal factor causing fluctuation in number during the winter season. The temperature and precipitation conditions during the period of the census were not average. The dry tall characteristic of this region prevailed extremely late. The first precipitation of any consequence and in the form of snow occurred in late December. An extremely cold period during January and February followed this dry fall season. The spring season was later than usual, the temperature falling to moderate until late March. These variations from the average weather conditions produced three effects: first, a delayed fall migration; second, limited feeding area for the wintering birds due to restricted areas of open water while the lake surface was frozen; third, a delayed spring migration which was concentrated an of short duration...|$|R

40|$|Many bird migrations {{occur at}} night and {{therefore}} are difficult to observe. Radar stations designed to track weather can detect large migrations, which may then be viewed as digitally-recorded radar data. In radar images, migratory birds can be distinguished from weather by their shape and their movement relative to the direction of wind. Every fall, millions of eared grebes (Podiceps nigricollis) arrive at Great Salt Lake to feed on brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana). Brine shrimp are abundant in Great Salt Lake and this prey source allows eared grebes to substantially increase their body mass before migrating south. When eared grebes depart from Great Salt Lake, they consistently appear on nearby weather radar as a south-bound column that passes between the mountain ranges south of the lake. We analyzed radial velocity radar data to determine fall departure dates of eared grebes from Great Salt Lake during the migration periods of 1999 to 2013. Previous studies hypothesized that brine shrimp availability or weather may influence the departure of eared grebes. We examined these and other environmental variables that may affect timing of <b>eared</b> <b>grebe</b> departure...|$|R

Today, most {{writings}} about natural features and charismatic landscapes tend to be of two types: those with subjective, generalized descriptions written for the layperson, or technical articles with great detail but {{little in the way}} of human emotion. This book, written by a professor who spent fifteen summers in the Nebraska Sandhills, presents sufficient technical detail to satisfy the professional, but at the same time conveys the images and emotions of the Sandhills plants, animals, and people. About 50, 000 square kilometers-one-fourth of Nebraska-are covered by the Sandhills, making this the largest area of sand dunes in the Western Hemisphere. These dunes, which reach heights of 140 meters above the intervening valleys and overlay sandy geological substrates (among them the famous Ogallala aquifer) that may reach a total depth of 300 meters, are covered with grasslands and associated shrublands, wetlands, and small amounts of forests. In addition to describing vegetation patterns and successional pathways, the author provides engaging accounts of the life histories of several typical sand dune inhabitants, including the burrowing owl, box turtle, yucca moth, long-billed curlew, kangaroo rat, grasshopper mouse, brook stickleback, <b>eared</b> <b>grebe,</b> and cliff swallow and barn swallow...|$|R

5|$|The {{black-necked grebe}} (Podiceps nigricollis), known in North America as the <b>eared</b> <b>grebe,</b> {{is a member}} of the grebe family of water birds. It was {{described}} in 1831 by Christian Ludwig Brehm. There are currently three accepted subspecies, including the nominate subspecies. Its breeding plumage features a distinctive ochre-coloured plumage that extends behind its eye and over its ear coverts. The rest of the upper parts, including the head, neck, and breast, are coloured black to blackish brown. The flanks are tawny rufous to maroon-chestnut, and the abdomen is white. When in its non-breeding plumage, this bird has greyish-black upper parts, including the top of the head and a vertical stripe on the back of the neck. The flanks are also greyish-black. The rest of the body is a white or whitish colour. The juvenile has more brown in its darker areas. The subspecies californicus can be distinguished from the nominate by the former's usually longer bill. The other subspecies, P. n. gurneyi, can be differentiated by its greyer head and upper parts and by its smaller size. P. n. gurneyi can also be told apart by its lack of a non-breeding plumage. This species is present in parts of Africa, Eurasia, and the Americas.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Seven {{species of}} water-dependent birds ({{northern}} phalarope, Phalaropus lobatus; American avocet, Recurvirostra americana; Wilson's phalarope, P. tricolor; <b>eared</b> <b>grebe,</b> Podiceps nigricollis; ring-billed gull Larus delawarensis; California gull, L. californicus; and northern shoveler, Anas clypeata) were studied {{during the fall}} migrations of 1982 and 1983 to determine the diets and foraging strategies of mixed-species feeding assemblages at an alkaline lake in southcentral Oregon. Information on density and distribution of birds and their prey resources was collected at permanent sampling points along {{the eastern shore of}} Lake Abert, Lake Co., OR. Determination of diet composition was based on analysis of stomach samples from collected specimens. Between-species comparisons of diet composition were made using classification analyses. Diet samples were compared to prey availability samples to discern whether birds fed preferentially on particular prey types. Timed observations were used to develop time budgets. Multivariate ordination procedures were used {{to determine the extent of}} niche overlap and resource partitioning. Structural measurements were taken from collected specimens to aid in assessment of physiological condition of migrants. Total numbers of migrants using Lake Abert varied from year to year. Numbers of all species except eared grebes and gulls were lower in 1983 than in 1982. Total sample biomass of prey also declined between 1982 and 1983. Fifteen potential prey types were identified within the lake and along the lakeshore. Of these, the alkali fly (Ephydra hians) was the principal prey of all birds except the northern shoveler, whose diet included large percentages of brine shrimp (Artemia salina) and water fleas (Moina sp.).

40|$|Despite the hemispheric {{importance}} of Great Salt Lake (GSL) as a staging area for migratory birds, {{little is known}} about the resources that GSL provides to these birds, or how changes to the GSL ecosystem might impact the avian community. Three species of migratory waterbirds that stage at GSL are Wilson’s phalaropes (Phalaropus tricolor), red-necked phalaropes (Phalaropus lobatus), and eared grebes (Podiceps nigricollis). My objective for this research was to study the impacts of prey availability on the staging ecology of these species. In Chapter 2, I examined the use of GSL habitats by both species of phalaropes. In the high-salinity bays of GSL, phalaropes were most strongly associated with shallow water. In the low-salinity bay, there were no strong associations between phalarope presence and particular habitat characteristics. In Chapter 3, I analyzed the behaviors of phalaropes relative to prey densities. Phalaropes commonly foraged in Carrington Bay, which had the highest densities of brine fly (Ephydridae) adults, and in Farmington Bay, which had high densities of benthic macroinvertebrates. Foraging behavior differed between Wilson’s and red-necked phalaropes, with Wilson’s phalaropes spinning more often than red-necked phalaropes. In Chapter 4, I examined interannual and nightly variations in <b>eared</b> <b>grebe</b> fall migration departures in relation to prey availability and environmental conditions. Eared grebes began migration relatively early when lake temperatures were relatively warm, densities of brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) adults were high, and densities of brine shrimp cysts were low. The likelihood that eared grebes would depart on a given night was positively associated with the average barometric pressure 12 hours prior to sunset. The resources provided by GSL support substantial proportions of the staging populations of phalaropes and eared grebes. Management efforts should seek to maintain the habitats and resources needed by phalaropes and eared grebes at GSL. Future large-scale diversions of freshwater may threaten GSL’s suitability as a staging area for these birds...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The Salton Sea (SS) is {{the largest}} inland body of water in California: surface area 980 km 2, volume 7. 3 million acre-feet, 58 km long, 14 – 22 km wide, maximum depth 15 m. Located in the southeastern Sonoran desert of California, it is 85 m below sea level at its lowest point. It was formed between 1905 and 1907 from heavy river flows of the Colorado River. Since its formation, it has {{attracted}} both people and wildlife, including flocks of migratory birds that have made the Salton Sea a critical stopover on the Pacific flyway. Over the past 15 years wintering populations of <b>eared</b> <b>grebe</b> (Podiceps nigricollis) at the Salton Sea, have experienced over 200, 000 mortalities. The cause of these large die-offs remains unknown. The unique environmental conditions of the Salton Sea, including salinities from brackish freshwater at river inlets to hypersaline conditions, extreme daily summer temperatures (> 38 °C), and high nutrient loading from rivers and agricultural drainage favor eutrophic conditions that encourage algal blooms throughout the year. A significant component of these algal blooms are the prokaryotic group – the Cyanophyta or blue-green algae (also called Cyanobacteria). Since many Cyanobacteria produce toxins (the cyanotoxins) it became important to evaluate their presence and {{to determine if they}} are a contributing factor in eared-grebe mortalities at the Salton Sea. Results From November 1999 to April 2001, 247 water and sediment samples were received for phytoplankton identification and cyanotoxin analyses. Immunoassay (ELISA) screening of these samples found that eighty five percent of all water samples contained low but detectable levels of the potent cyclic peptide liver toxin called microcystins. Isolation and identification of cyanobacteria isolates showed that the picoplanktonic Synechococcus and the benthic filamentous Oscillatoria were dominant. Both organisms were found to produce microcystins dominated by microcystin-LR and YR. A laboratory strain of Synechococcus was identified by PCR as being closest to known marine forms of this genus. Analyses of affected grebe livers found microcystins at levels that may account for some of the acute mortalities. Conclusion The production of microcystins by a marine Synechococcus indicates that microcystins may be a more common occurrence in marine environments – a finding not recognized before this work. Further research should be done to define the distribution of microcystin producing marine cyanobacteria and to determine exposure/response effects of microcystins and possibly other cyanotoxins in the Salton Sea. Future efforts to reduce avian mortalities and remediate the Salton Sea should evaluate vectors by which microcystins enter avian species and ways to control and mitigate toxic cyanobacteria waterblooms at the Salton Sea. </p...|$|R

40|$|Sedimentary features, mineralogy, bulk geochemical composition, {{stable isotope}} {{analyses}} and pollen data from sediment cores {{were used to}} reconstruct the Late Quaternary depositional evolution of the Salada Mediana playa lake (central Ebro Basin, northeastern Spain). The 150 -cm-long sediment core sequence is composed of gypsum- and dolomite-rich muds (Lower and Middle sections) and black, laminated, calcite-bearing sediments (Upper section). The Salada Mediana formed as a karstic depression in the Miocene gypsum substratum during the Late Pleistocene. The Lower section was deposited in a sulphate-carbonate saline lake that ended with a period of desiccation and basin floor deflation. Subsequent deposition (Middle section) {{took place in a}} playa-lake system. Two cycles of lower water table and expanded saline mud flats occurred. The Holocene sequence is missing, probably as a result of aeolian erosion. Sedimentation resumed only a few centuries ago, and saline pan environments dominated until modern times.

40|$|The Middle Ordovician (Darriwilian) Winneshiek Shale from Winneshiek County, Iowa, USA, hosts a Konservat-Lagerstätte {{that has}} yielded a diverse fauna {{including}} soft-bodied fossils. The shale {{is rich in}} organic content; in particular, algal material and fragmentary cuticular remains. Palynological acid treatment alongside modified, low-manipulation processing enables the extraction of these ‘small carbonaceous fossils’ (SCFs) from the matrix, allowing a more detailed view of their morphology. Together these methods have yielded exceptionally well-preserved crustacean-type setae and a population of distinctive microfossils which we identify as the feeding appendages of a small-bodied arthropod. We present two hypotheses for their identity: as either pancrustacean mandibles, or euchelicerate coxae. Overall, the detailed topological similarities and implied functional equivalence to the coxae of xiphosurid chelicerates, in particular, outweigh the resemblance to certain branchiopodan and hexapodan mandibles. In turn, however, the restricted size range and lack of associated limb or carapace fragments pose a taphonomic conundrum, suggesting an extreme biostratinomic bias. By comparison with previously described arthropodan SCFs from the Cambrian of Canada, the Winneshiek fossils extend the geographic, palaeoenvironmental and temporal range of this taphonomic window and provide a complementary tool for reconstructing the diversity and ecology of the Winneshiek biota.
