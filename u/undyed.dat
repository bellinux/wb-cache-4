5|$|During the Tudor {{period the}} Reformation {{produced}} a gradual shift to Protestantism, {{and much of}} London passed from church to private ownership. Woollen cloth was shipped <b>undyed</b> and undressed from London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries, where it was considered indispensable. But the reach of English maritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the seas of north-west Europe. The commercial route to Italy and the Mediterranean Sea normally lay through Antwerp and over the Alps; any ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to or from England {{were likely to be}} Italian or Ragusan. Upon the re-opening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565, there ensued a strong outburst of commercial activity. The Royal Exchange was founded. Mercantilism grew, and monopoly trading companies such as the East India Company were established, with trade expanding to the New World. London became the principal North Sea port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.|$|E

25|$|The chronicler Gervase of Canterbury {{noted that}} the Augustinians of Haughmond were Canonici Albi, that is, white canons. The {{so-called}} white habit was probably simply of <b>undyed</b> wool and may reinforce suggestions that Haughmond was an independent eremetical community before it was absorbed, with all such groups, into the Augustinian order. A local chronicle notes that Haughmond adopted the typical Augustinian black habit in 1234.|$|E
25|$|Adinkra cloths were {{traditionally}} only worn by royalty {{and spiritual}} leaders for funerals and other very special occasions. They are now worn by anyone, stylishly wrapped around women or men on any special occasion. In the past they were hand printed on <b>undyed,</b> red, dark brown or black hand-woven cotton fabric {{depending on the}} occasion and the wearer's role; nowadays they are frequently mass-produced on brighter coloured fabrics.|$|E
25|$|Ixtle (maguey) fiber {{is still}} worked to create {{utilitarian}} {{items such as}} knapsacks and carrying bags, which in Santa Cruz Tanaco and Tarecuato are generally <b>undyed.</b> In Pómaro, Ostula, el Naranjito and Cachán the same fiber is used for larger bags used to carry pitchers and cobs. Ixtle thread {{is also used to}} embroider leather items such as hats, bridles, reigns, cinches. In Paracho, this fiber is dyed before being worked.|$|E

Traditional Lacandon shelters are huts made with fronds and wood with an earthen floor, {{but this has}} mostly given way to modern structures. The Lacandon Maya have supported themselves for centuries practicing a method of “agro-forestry” in which they rotate areas in which they plant crops. This features a fallow period to allow for soil regeneration.|$|E
25|$|The {{habit of}} the monks {{consisted}} of a tunic of <b>undyed</b> wool, over which was worn the cuculla, or cowl, of the same material. A {{great deal of time}} was devoted to various kinds of manual labour, not unlike the life in monasteries of other rules. The Rule of Saint Columbanus was approved of by the Synod of Mâcon in 627, but it was superseded {{at the close of the}} century by the Rule of Saint Benedict. For several centuries in some of the greater monasteries the two rules were observed conjointly.|$|E
25|$|A popular form of {{textile art}} in Japan is shibori (intricate tie dye), found {{on some of}} the more {{expensive}} kimonos and haori kimono jackets. Patterns are created by minutely binding the fabric and masking off areas, then dying it, usually by hand. When the bindings are removed, an <b>undyed</b> pattern is revealed. Shibori work can be further enhanced with yuzen (hand applied) drawing or painting with textile dyes or with embroidery; it is then known as tsujigahana. Shibori textiles are very time-consuming to produce and require great skill, so the textiles and garments created from them are very expensive and highly prized.|$|E

Alan leads Dickon and others to waylay the Abbot of Rufford, disguising themselves as a knight and luring him into an ambush. Seeing Dickon's talent for disguises, Robin sends the boy to infiltrate D'Eyncourt Castle and acquire information about its defences. Disguised as a page with bleached hair, Dickon manages to penetrate D'Eyncourt on Christmas, but is betrayed by an <b>undyed</b> lock of hair. Pursued, he hides on the chapel's beams and eventually escapes from the castle, surviving a crossbow shot.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} monks of Cîteaux elected Alberic {{as their}} abbot, under whose leadership the abbey would find its grounding. Robert {{had been the}} idealist of the order, and Alberic was their builder. Upon assuming the role of abbot, Alberic moved {{the site of the}} fledgling community near a brook a short distance away from the original site. Alberic discontinued the use of Benedictine black garments in the abbey and clothed the monks in white habits of <b>undyed</b> wool. He returned the community to the original Benedictine ideal of manual work and prayer, dedicated to the ideal of charity and self sustenance. Alberic also forged an alliance with the Dukes of Burgundy, working out a deal with Duke Odo I of Burgundy concerning the donation of a vineyard (Meursault) as well as stones with which they built their church. The church was consecrated and dedicated to the Virgin Mary on November 16, 1106, by the Bishop of Chalon sur Saône.|$|E
25|$|The Ch’ols of Chiapas {{migrated}} to the northwest of the state starting about 2,000 years ago, when they were concentrated in Guatemala and Honduras. Those Ch’ols who remained in the south are distinguished by the name Chortís. Chiapas Ch’ols {{are closely related to}} the Chontal in Tabasco as well. Choles are found in Tila, Tumbalá, Sabanilla, Palenque, and Salto de Agua, with an estimated population of about 115,000 people. The Ch’ol language belongs to the Maya family and is related to Tzeltal, Tzotzil, Lacandon, Tojolabal, and Yucatec Mayan. There are three varieties of Chol (spoken in Tila, Tumbalá, and Sabanilla), all mutually intelligible. Over half of speakers are monolingual in the Chol language. Women wear a long navy blue or black skirt with a white blouse heavily embroidered with bright colors and a sash with a red ribbon. The men only occasionally use traditional dress for events such as the feast of the Virgin of Guadalupe. This dress usually includes pants, shirts and huipils made of <b>undyed</b> cotton, with leather huaraches, a carrying sack and a hat. The fundamental economic activity of the Ch’ols is agriculture. They primarily cultivate corn and beans, as well as sugar cane, rice, coffee, and some fruits. They have Catholic beliefs strongly influenced by native ones. Harvests are celebrated on the Feast of Saint Rose on 30 August.|$|E
500|$|The wool {{produced}} by the Shetland has historically been a valuable commodity. Shetlands produce numerous shades of wool colours (see below), and this variety was commercially important to the wool industry of the Shetland Isles, where natural wools are often used <b>undyed.</b> Tweed is also produced from the coarser Shetland wool, but the Isles are best known for their multicoloured knitwear (made using Fair Isle knitting) and for the traditional knitted lace shawls which are so fine, they will pass through a wedding ring.

In this endeavor, the king was {{following}} a general strategy of establishing Catholic institutions on land he had recently won in battle from the Moors of Iberia. The Cistercian [...] "white monks" [...] (wearing <b>undyed</b> habits) first chose a site in Murel (now called Carrascosa de Tajo) on the Tagus, {{but after a few}} years, had to relocate to more fertile zone a few miles nearer to Trillo, Guadalajara, where a flat hilltop by the river commanded a modest view.|$|E

2500|$|In the United Kingdom, two {{grades of}} heating oil are defined. BS 2869 Class C1 is the lightest grade used for lanterns, camping stoves, wick heaters, and mixed with {{gasoline}} in some vintage combustion engines {{as a substitute}} for tractor vaporising oil. BS 2869 Class C2 is a heavier distillate, which is used as domestic heating oil. Premium kerosene is usually sold in 5 or 20 liter containers from hardware, camping and garden stores and is often dyed purple. [...] Standard kerosene is usually dispensed in bulk by a tanker and is <b>undyed.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Each Tzeltal {{community}} {{constitutes a}} distinct {{social and cultural}} unit with its own well-defined lands, wearing apparel, kinship system, politico-religious organization, economic resources, crafts, and other cultural features. [...] Women are distinguished by a black skirt with a wool belt and an <b>undyed</b> cotton bloused embroidered with flowers. Their hair is tied with ribbons {{and covered with a}} cloth. Most men do not use traditional attire. Agriculture is the basic economic activity of the Tzeltal people. Traditional Mesoamerican crops such as maize, beans, squash, and chili peppers are the most important, but a variety of other crops, including wheat, manioc, sweet potatoes, cotton, chayote, some fruits, other vegetables, and coffee.|$|E

This is performed by officials of the , an ancient court office responsible for, among other things, maintaining the king's wardrobe and attending to the bodies of royals after death. The body is first dressed in white, with the appropriate accessories. It is then ritually tied with <b>undyed</b> string, and wrapped in a white shroud. The body is finally placed in a foetal position in the kot. A chada (pointed crown) is ritually placed on the head of the body, before the lid of the kot is finally closed.|$|E
2500|$|Wool was {{the most}} popular fabric for all classes by far, {{followed}} by linen and hemp. [...] Wool fabrics were available {{in a wide range of}} qualities, from rough <b>undyed</b> cloth to fine, dense broadcloth with a velvety nap. High-value broadcloth was a backbone of the English economy and was exported throughout Europe. [...] Wool fabrics were dyed in rich colours, notably reds, greens, golds, and blues, although the actual blue colour achievable with dyeing with woad (and less frequently indigo) could not match the characteristic rich lapis lazuli pigment blues depicted in contemporary illuminated manuscripts such as the Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry.|$|E
2500|$|Pliny the Elder {{describes}} {{the production of}} linen from flax and hemp. After harvesting, the plant stems were retted to loosen the outer layers and internal fibres, stripped, pounded and then smoothed. Following this, the materials were woven. Flax, like wool, came in various speciality grades and qualities. In Pliny's opinion, the whitest (and best) was imported from Spanish Saetabis; at double the price, the strongest and most long-lasting was from Retovium. The whitest and softest was produced in Latium, Falerii and Paelignium. Natural linen was a [...] "greyish brown" [...] that faded to off-white through repeated laundering and exposure to sunlight. It did not readily absorb the dyes in use at the time, and was generally bleached, or used in its raw, <b>undyed</b> state.|$|E
2500|$|In modern Hebrew idiom, the sarcastic expression, [...] "a {{completely}} blue tallit" [...] (טלית שכולה תכלת) {{is widely}} {{used to refer to}} something that is ostensibly, but not really, absolutely pure, immaculate and virtuous. (An English parallel might be calling someone [...] "Mr. Perfect.") The expression stems from rabbinic lore about the biblical figure Korah who led a revolt against the leadership of Moses and Aaron. Koraḥ was said to have asked Moses a number of vexatious, mocking questions, one of which was, [...] "Does a tallit made entirely of blue yarn require tzitzit?" [...] To Moses' affirmative answer, Koraḥ objected that an ordinary (<b>undyed)</b> tallit is rendered 'kosher' (meaning, in this context, ritually fit to be worn) by attaching to its corners the tzitzit tassels, whose key feature was the single thread of blue (פתיל תכלת) contained in each tassel. If so, what addition of holiness could the tzitzit contribute to a tallit which was made entirely of the same sky-blue yarn? ...|$|E
2500|$|The animal carpet {{fragment}} {{is approximately}} half the original size. Its field contains two large, 16-pointed star medallions of identical design which both include an eight-pointed star within an octagon. In every second {{segment of the}} medallions two birds appear, alternating with two four-legged animals. The field between the medallions is ornamented with smaller rosettes and eight-pointed stars. Each corner contains a mosque lamp ornament. In {{the center of the}} long side an octagonal smaller medallion is inserted. The Batári-Crivelli fragment resembles the [...] "Dragon and Phoenix" [...] and [...] "Marby" [...] rugs in having a yellow ground and two large medallions as the main element of design. Chromatographic analysis of the dyes revealed yellow from an undefined plant, indigo blue, madder (Rubia tinctorum) red, a blue green derived from indigo, Dyer's weed (Reseda luteola), and Dyer's sage (Salvia fruticosa), dark brown and <b>undyed,</b> ivory wool.

He commented: [...] "EastEnders goes live and the makeover miracle of Albert Square is born." [...] He said that character Alfie Moon [...] "made the unfortunate transition into his very own Mr Hyde, Shane Richie" [...] {{and said that the}} cast were shouting every line so they could be heard over the extras.

[...] Talking about Billy being stuck on the train, the Elstree & Borehamwood Times wrote: [...] "Viewers sat biting their nails on tenterhooks, waiting to see if he would make it back to Walford in time." [...] Karen Edwards from Heat called the episode [...] "quite the special night" [...] and said that it was [...] "Not an easy task" [...] for Fenwick. She called his wink [...] "cheeky" [...] and [...] "brilliant", saying it [...] "just showed how real the whole thing was". She added that it was [...] "emotional" [...] to watch, and said that Harold [...] "did the best fake birth screaming we've seen in a long while. [...] Pretty impressive work, we're sure you'll agree." [...] Matt Brito from Comedy Central UK said the fact that nothing went wrong in the live broadcast was [...] "boring". Laura Morgan from All About Soap said the live segment was [...] "seamless", saying it deserved a gold medal for [...] "the best thing on TV last night". She said she loved Fenwick's wink to the camera and praised Harold, saying the birth finished off the live segment [...] "perfectly", adding: [...] "Hats off to relative newbie Danielle Harold (aka Lola) for making the birth scenes look so realistic on live TV...

2500|$|There are {{indigenous}} communities {{in seven of}} the 18 municipalities of the state, mostly Otomi and Pame. These communities are divided into three regions: South, Arid Center and Sierra Madre Oriental, with the Otomis dominating {{in the first two}} and the Pames in the last. [...] The most important indigenous group in the state is the Otomi. These people have inhabited central Mexico for over 5,000 years and were part of cities and empires such as Cuicuilco, Teotihuacan and Tula. Their language is part of the Oto-mangueana family, which includes Pame, Mazahua, Matlatzinca and the Chichimeca-Jonaz languages. They have maintained their language, which is called hñahñu, which literally means to speak with nasal sounds. However, most Otomi speakers are bilingual. Their name for themselves varies in the different areas of central Mexico where they live, but in southern part of Querétaro, they call themselves the Ñano. Otomi communities in the state have their own authorities, in addition to Mexican ones, in both the civil and religious arenas, who are elected annually. Most profess the Catholic faith, but it is influenced by indigenous beliefs. The trading of goods is still {{an important part of the}} economy of many Otomi communities, and they are known for their abilities with herbal medicines. A number who live in rural areas can still be seen in traditional dress. For women, this includes a hand-embroidered blouse and skirt, a garment called a quexquemetl and huaraches. For men, this includes shirts and pants of <b>undyed</b> [...] or white cotton, tied with an embroidered belt, huaraches and a hat made with palm fronds. These communities are located in south in Amealco de Bonfil. Here, over 25,000 people live in 31 communities, such as San Ildefonso, Tultepec, Santiago Mexquititlán, Chitejé de la Cruz and San Miguel Tlaxcatltepec. In the arid parts of the center of the state, {{indigenous communities}} are found in the municipalities of Tolimán, Cadereyta, Colón and Ezequiel Montes, with about 21,500 Otomis in 56 different communities. In the Sierra Madre Oriental, about 3,775 people, mostly Pame with an important group of Huastecas are found in three communities in the municipalities of Jalpan de Serra and Arroyo Seco. [...] However, of all the people in these indigenous communities, only a total of 23,363 spoke an indigenous language, primarily Otomi, as of 2005. Most (94.8%) of these were also speakers of Spanish.|$|E

For the rest, he was a polished, cultivated man; yet, in the characteristic, material criticism of youth, I am afraid that Clarence chiefly identified him as a priest with large hands, whose soft palms seemed to be cushioned with kindness, and whose equally large feet, encased in extraordinary shapeless shoes of <b>undyed</b> leather, seemed to tread down noiselessly--rather than to ostentatiously crush--the obstacles that beset the path of the young student.
