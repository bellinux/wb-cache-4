60|$|Our {{afternoon}} {{drive was}} more picturesque and noteworthy. Soracte rose before us, bulging up quite abruptly {{out of the}} plain, and keeping itself entirely distinct from a whole horizon of hills. Byron well compares it to a wave just on the bend, and about to break over towards the spectator. As we approached it nearer and nearer, {{it looked like the}} barrenest great rock that ever protruded out of the substance of the earth, with scarcely a strip or a spot of verdure upon its steep and gray declivities. The road kept trending towards the mountain, following the line of the old Flaminian Way, which we could see, at frequent intervals, close beside the modern track. It is paved with large flag-stones, laid so accurately together, that it is still, in some places, as smooth and even as the floor of a church; and everywhere the tufts of grass find it difficult to root themselves into the interstices. Its course is straighter than that of the road of to-day, which often turns aside to avoid obstacles which the ancient one surmounted. Much of it, probably, is covered with the soil and overgrowth deposited in later years; and, now and then, we could see its flag-stones partly protruding from the bank through which our road has been cut, and thus showing that the thickness of this massive pavement was more than a foot of solid stone. We lost it over and over again; but still it reappeared, now on one side of <b>us,</b> <b>now</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other; perhaps from beneath the roots of old trees, or the pasture-land of a thousand years old, and leading on towards the base of Soracte. I forget where we finally lost it. Passing through a town called Rignano, we found it dressed out in festivity, with festoons of foliage along both sides of the street, which ran beneath a triumphal arch, bearing an inscription in honor of a ducal personage of the Massimi family. I know no occasion for the feast, except that it is Whitsuntide. The town was thronged with peasants, in their best attire, and we met others on their way thither, particularly women and girls, with heads bare in the sunshine; but there was no tiptoe jollity, nor, indeed, any more show of festivity than I have seen in my own country at a cattle-show or muster. Really, I think, not half so much.|$|E

30|$|Let <b>us</b> <b>now</b> comment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{existing}} {{approaches to}} the nonlinear valuation of derivatives, as first developed by El Karoui and Quenez (1997) and El Karoui et al.

(2018), Brigo and Pallavicini (2014), Crépey (2015 a, b), Dumitrescu et al. (2017), Mercurio (2013) or Pallavicini et al. (2012 a, b)). The most common approach to the valuation problem in a nonlinear framework seems to hinge, at least implicitly, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> following steps {{in which it is}} usually assumed that the hedger’s initial endowment is immaterial and thus it may be set to zero. In fact, Step (N. 1) was explicitly addressed only in some of the above-mentioned works, whereas in most papers in the existing literature the authors were only concerned with the issue of finding a replicating or a superhedging strategy, as briefly outlined in Step (N. 2). Also, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, the important issue emphasized in Step (N. 3) has been completely ignored up to now, since apparently it was implicitly taken for granted that the cost of replication, as given by a solution to a suitable BSDE, is a fair price of the contract.|$|R

She had two reefs in her top-sails, with spanker, jib, and both courses set, like a craft that carried convenient, rather than urgent canvass. Her line of sailing would take her about two hundred yards to leeward of us, and my first impulse was to luff. A second glance showed us she was an English frigate, and we doused our lugg as soon as possible. Our hearts were in our mouths {{for the next five}} minutes. My eye never turned from that frigate, as she hove by <b>us,</b> <b>now</b> rising <b>on</b> <b>the</b> summit of a sea, now falling gracefully into the trough, concealing everything but her spars from sight.

30|$|Let <b>us</b> <b>now</b> comment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{projection}} in Fig.  2 : in {{an effective}} projection mapping, dissimilar data samples, {{according to the}} values of their describing attributes, are positioned farther apart than samples that are more similar, which are positioned closer. Notice that, although the projection visually resembles the scatterplots typically employed to display the relationship between two data attributes, it has a distinct interpretation, as no attribute is being mapped to either the horizontal or vertical axes. The placement of the data samples in the two-dimensional space is relative and only indicates global proximity, or similarity. In the projection view in Fig.  2, each circle depicts a flower sample, with the color mapping flower type. It has been computed considering the four descriptive attributes simultaneously, using the Euclidean distance as an approximation of dissimilarity. Observing the color coded projection one notes that the setosa flowers are very different from the virginica and versicolour, whereas these latter two are not fully distinguishable, as some green and red samples are actually very close, i.e., similar. One infers that taking these four attributes to describe the samples may cause some flowers to be mistakenly classified as verginica or versicolour. So, other additional measures would be needed in order to correctly identify all <b>the</b> flowers. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, we also know the projection is effective, in that it reveals information about the data set that is known to be correct.|$|R

In this paper, the term “uncertainty” is often used with reference to the management of risks arising from intentionally malicious acts 3. The costs of security in this sense of the term are an element of every transport budget today. In addition to the costs of prevention, surveillance and forecasting, the costs of the potential damages arising from such acts will also have to be taken into consideration from this point onwards.

Here US 6 mostly remains on its original routing, with the main difference being between Hartford and Terryville, where US 6 followed the present Route 4, Route 10, and Route 72.

40|$|The cloth-dyers of West Africa {{are known}} to produce indigo {{textiles}} which reputation needs no making. These various productions, often times centuries old, have been continuously exposed to the turmoil {{of a variety of}} external events which have often made them very fragile or, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other hand, have brought about prosperity. Among those events, let us cite the caravan trade across the Sahara and the Sahel, the establishment of trading posts by <b>the</b> Europeans <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Coast, the Senegal River and the Niger, the slave trade, the development of small indigo factories, colonization by the English, the French and the Portuguese, the chemical and industrial revolutions, local and regional politics, world conflicts, the 1929 economic crash, independences, climate changes, development programs and technical assistance, fashion globalization, terrorism, tourism, international fairs, etc. While, in some areas, indigo dyeing has simply vanished and {{is no more than a}} cherished memory which the elderly women talk about while preserving carefully old indigo wrappers for special occasions, in other areas indigo cloth-dyeing seems to be prospering since the late 1980 s, due to a renewed interest in the Western world for natural products (locally grown organic cotton, natural dyes, handmade crafts) and, an appeal for “ethnic” products which has prompted a revival of the “traditional” indigo dyeing craft in West Africa. Textile and fashion designers, NGOs and private businesses have been instrumental in promoting the all-natural process. They have diversified the indigo textile production to meet Western tastes and high level standards: the motifs and decors of indigo wrappers are now offered in a range of linen, upholstery fabrics, curtains, western style clothes, etc. The demand for this type of production has allowed the resurgence of a “tradition” in indigo cloth-dyeing, saving it from disappearance, and has created some employment. However, the overall impact, so far, remains limited to a few areas. At the same time, early this XXI century, two major series of events have had a negative impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> production of indigo textiles in West Africa, i. e. the economic penetration of the market of African textiles by China and, the wave of terror and insurgences led by Boko Haram in Northern Nigeria. The Chinese manufacture synthetic textiles reproducing a variety of traditional wrappers, including indigo wrappers. These counterfeit wrappers are put for sale in the region where they are usually produced, directly competing with the local cloth-dyers. Despite the low quality of these synthetic wrappers, many customers prefer to spend less than go for the more expensive locally produced cotton wrappers. As a result, indigo cloth-dyers have seen their sales decelerate and while some are struggling to stay in business, others have already given up. For the last few years, Northern Nigeria has been off limit to tourists and buyers who purchased the famous Hausa indigo cloth from Kano, a town re-known for centuries in all of West Africa for its indigo production. In addition, Nigeria’s government policies regarding import of textiles have put local production at a disadvantage. As a result, sales have gone way down and many Kano cloth-dyers have had to leave their ground pits and find another occupation. But, let <b>us</b> <b>now</b> focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> productions of two specific types of women garments, the Fouta-Djallon wrapper and the melhafa from Mauritania and see how they have evolved since the XIX century.

40|$|This paper aims {{to re-examine}} {{inequality}} {{in the current}} era of neo-liberal globalisation, {{with an emphasis on}} both highly unequal middle-income countries that have already implemented full-blown economic reforms (like Latin America and South Africa), and on OECD countries (like <b>the</b> <b>US)</b> <b>now</b> intent <b>on</b> replicating <b>the</b> inequality heights of the former. i) How do those middle-income countries end up having such unequal distributional outcomes? ii) Since oligarchies all over the world would gladly reproduce the same conditions, why until recently have only a few been able to get away with this degree of inequality? And iii) Why are there suddenly so many new entrants to the high-inequality club, especially from the OECD? In other words, how did Reagan and Thatcher and the fall of the Berlin Wall trigger a new process of "reverse catching-up", by which now it is the highly-unequal middle-income countries showing the advanced ones the shape of things to come? One might even argue that in the US not only is the 1 % catching up with their Latin counterparts (who are used to appropriating between a quarter and a third of overall income), but that new developments such as Trump may be part of the same phenomenon: it is now the South that seems to show the North 'the image of their own future'. And regarding that future, it is tempting to say "welcome to the Third World"! We are all indeed converging in this neo-liberal era but, somehow unexpectedly, this convergence is towards features that so far have characterised a number of middle-income countries - e. g. huge inequalities due to mobile élites creaming off the rewards of economic growth, and 'magic realist' politics (that may lack self-respect but not originality). I also discuss why Piketty's persistence with the neo-classical theory of factor shares - a pretty much obsolete 1950 s-style approach to the distribution of income - prevents him from bringing our understanding of current distributive affairs forward as much as he might. His neo-classical analysis not only does not 'fit the facts' (he has to resort to questionable parameters), but also leads him into a methodology and social ontology that assumes that particularly complex and over-determined processes (like the distribution of income) are just the simple sum of their parts. Therefore, their account can be reduced to the algebraic description of individual constituents (e. g., inequality as basically an endogenous outcome of r>g - and that would be all). I also outline an alternative narrative regarding why inequality is becoming so extreme in formerly more enlightened affluent societies. I conclude that in order to understand current distributive dynamics what really matters is to comprehend the forces determining the share of the rich — and in terms of growth, what they choose to do with it!neoliberalis...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{will have}} two main parts. First, let us start with an example. In finance, the {{standard}} version of the Black-Scholes formula is a beautiful closed form solution used to price European options. This famous formula is ingenious, but has a flaw that relegates it to {{something that should be}} admired, and perhaps not be used in the real world. It relies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> assumption that prices of shares evolve according to geometric Brownian motion. This means that we are willing to accept that extreme shocks to prices are almost impossible. Is this a realistic assumption? Of course not. The stock market crashes of 1929, 1987 are great examples to show that extreme events do happen. More recently, the 1997 Asian crisis and 2000 crash of the NASDAQ show that in addition, such events are not so rare. These jumps occur even more frequently and are larger in magnitude for share prices of individual companies. This problem is by no means new, and a plethora of models and pricing techniques have been developed. The standard Black-Scholes formula is just one example, but this is simply illustration of the matter at hand. The process that we use to model a financial time series is of paramount importance, whether we do it for forecasting purposes or for pricing financial derivatives. If we choose to use a model that does not capture the key empirical aspects of the data, then any subsequent inference may be very unfavourably biased. It is because of this problem that we should investigate the more standard modeling that assumes continuity and normal or log-normal distribution of financial time series. We will begin from the very basics and we will see that this is a wonderful piece of theory, deserving of the reputation it has in being simple, groundbreaking and extremely useful. This work should bring us to a position where we can evaluate a second goal. Stochastic processes with jumps and "heavy-tails" have existed for some time, but have begun to filter through to the financial industry only recently. This lag is due to the perceived added conceptual difficulty in the introduction of such models, although we will see that this should not be the case. There is plenty of real evidence that nancial time series exhibit discontinuous behaviour and that these series are far from normally or log-normally distributed. Rather than looking at standard models as correct, and jump or stochastic volatility models as complicated, we should look upon standard models as educational but not sufficient for the real world. Stochastic volatility or jump models should instead be viewed as natural. The theme of the thesis is the importance of choosing a correct model for the underlying process. Although we may speak of the implications of some models to hedging, we will not actually look at specific hedging techniques. The particular aspect of pricing is also not considered in full scope although we will see the Black-Scholes pricing formula. We will consider that the main problem is to specify the model correctly where the method of pricing is a subsequent technicality. In examples we may take pricing tools like Monte-Carlo simulation as a given. We will not strive for full generality or formality, but rather take a physical approach and aim for clarity and understanding.
