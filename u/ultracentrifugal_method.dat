40|$|The journal Clinical Chemistry {{has played}} a major role in facilitating the {{progress}} that has occurred in lipid and lipoprotein testing over the past 50 years. In celebration of the 50 th anniversary of the Journal, this Special Report highlights five selected areas of highly significant accom-plishments during the past 50 years contributed by key researchers, some whose careers have spanned the entire history of modern lipid analysis and research. An overview of the history of lipid analysis from nonspecific strong acid methods to modern enzymatic assays, fully integrated lipoprotein methods, and the remarkable instrumentation developed by industry is presented by G. Russell Warnick. Dr. Bill Friedewald, whose name is associated with the widely recognized calculation of LDL-cholesterol (1), will relate the genesis of this important development. His 1972 report in Clinical Chemistry (1) has become the most cited ever in the Journal, with more than 6000 citations. Dr. Richard Havel developed an <b>ultracentrifugal</b> <b>method</b> in 1955 that continues to be the common citation for preparative isolation of the lipoproteins (2). The Lipid Research Clinic (LRC) 4 laboratories, in addition to assay-ing for cholesterol and triglycerides, separated VLDL from the bottom layer of LDL and HDL for HDL analyses by ultracentrifugation, following this method. Dr. Havel, who is still active in lipid research, provides his views on the history of the lipoproteins and separation methodol-ogy...|$|E
40|$|The {{widely used}} heparin/MnCl 2 {{precipitation}} procedure for determination of plasma high-density lipoprotein cho-lesterol has been re-examined {{in light of}} recent reports that isolated preparations of the lipoprotein are only partly precipitated under the test conditions. in the present study, the procedure as applied to plasma tolerated rather wide variations in heparin and MnCI 2 concentrations without significant effects on theassayed values in several plasma pools tested. The procedure was further tested on 129 individual samples by comparison with an <b>ultracentrifugal</b> <b>method</b> in which high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol is assumed to be represented by the cholesterol content of the plasma fraction of relative (to water) density greater than 1. 063. Our results indicate that high-density lipopro-tein is not precipitated under the test conditions when applied to unfractionated plasma.

The determination of HDL-chol 7 (d = 1. 063 - 1. 25) is important in the es-timation of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol either This work was performed in the following Core Lipid and Lipo-protein Laboratories as part of the collaborative endeavors of the Laboratory Methods Committee of the Lipid Research Clinics Pro-gram...|$|E
40|$|Urushi, the latex of the lacquer tree, {{which is}} a unique product in southern-east Asia, and an {{indispensable}} material for "lacquer ware". Urushi consists of phenolic matter, gum, nitrogen containing matter and laccase. All the components above stated {{have been known to}} be necessary for hardening of urushi. Analysis of various kinds of urushi and also measurement of rate of the hardening ware reported by Suzuka. His results lead to a conclusion that the quantity of the gum of urushi {{may be related to the}} rate of hardening. For the gum, however, few studies have been reported. In this investigation, a new polysaccharide, one of the main components of the gum from the latex of the Japanese lacquer tree, was obtained, the chemical structure of the main chain of the polysaccharide was studied and the possible steric configuration was proposed. I. Preparation of the polysaccharide. A electrophoretically and ultracentrafugically homogeneous polysaccharide was obtained from the gum of urushi, {{which is a}} production in Iwate Prefecture, by the fractional precipitation with alcohol and the treatment with Fehling's solution. II. Components of the polysaccharide. Analysis of the hydrolyzate of the polysaccharide was carried out and the following results was obtained; D-galactose: 41. 2 %, D-galacturonic acid: 40 %, D-glucuronic acid: 7 %. III. Identification of 6 - 0 -D-galacturonosyl D-galactose. A main component, Fraction C, of the partial hydrolyzate of the polysaccharide was separated by ion-exchange chromatography and the structure was studied. (A) Reducing activity of the Fraction C was about 1 / 2 of that of galactose, galacturonic acid or glucuronic acid. In the hydrolyzate of Fraction C, galactose and galacturonic acid were identified. Hence, it was assumed that the Fraction C was a disaccharide which consisted of galactose and galacturonic acid. (B) In the hydrolyzate of sodium borohydride reduction product of Fraction C, as neutral component only dulcitol was identified. (C) The ratio of periodate consumption and formic acid formation in periodate oxidation of Fraction C was 6 : 5 and formation of formaldehyde could not observe in this procedure. In the hydrolyzate of periodate oxidation product followed by sodium borohydride reduction of Fraction C, as natural components ethylene glycole and glycole aldehyde were identified. From the above mentioned results, it was proposed that the structure of Fraction C was 6 - 0 -D-galacturonosyl D-galactose. IV. The chemical structure of the polysaccharide. The ratio of periodate consumption and formic acid formation in periodate oxidation of the polysaccharide was 2 : 1. Galactose was found as the neutral hydrolyzate of periodate oxidation product followed by sodium borohydride reduction of the polysaccharide. As a neutal component of partial hydrolyzate of the polysaccharide, galactose was identified. From the above results, it may be considered that the polysaccharide is consisted of 6 - 0 -D-galacturonosyl D-galactose, which is linked to each other by 1 → 3 linkage of the galactose residue. V. Steric configuration of the polysaccharide. Molecular weight of the polysaccharide determined with Archibald's <b>ultracentrifugal</b> <b>method</b> is 6 × 10 ^ 4. Intrinsic viscosity of the polysaccharide determined with Fitz-Simons' dilution type viscometer is 0. 17. On the axial ratio and the length of the polysaccharide molecule, a good agreement was seen between the values deduced from viscometric results and those obtained from molecular structure models. As the final conclusion, it is proposed that the polysaccharide in which 6 - 0 -D-galacturonosyl D-galactose unit is linked to each other by 1 → 3 linkage of the galactose residue, has a helical structure and one turn of which consists of 6 to 7 units of galactose residue...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Low density {{lipoprotein}} (LDL) {{and intermediate}} density lipoprotein (IDL) classes {{have been shown}} to be composed of discrete metabolic entities or subclasses. Present <b>ultracentrifugal</b> <b>methods</b> are unable to precisely determine these subclasses. A new analytical micro-ultracentrifugal method was developed that facilitates the determination of IDL and LDL subclasses and their F 1. 2] flotation coefficient from <b>ultracentrifugal</b> scans. The <b>method</b> is based on the modification of a published equation (Fujita, H. 1956. J Chnn. Phys. 24 : 1084 - 1090) adapted to calculate concentration gradient boundary curves for IDL and LDL that are approximately Gaussian in form. Using an extension of this modified equation, theoretical distributions of the gradient curves were calculated. By applying the theoretical distributions, IDL and LDL subclasses were resolved from absorbance scans as Gaussian concentration gradient boundary curves. Both theoretically calculated and experimentally determined boundary curves for IDL and LDL lipoproteins were plotted and found to be in excellent agreement. I Three subclasses of LDL and four subclasses of IDL were determined. The mean flotation rates of the LDL subclasses were: LDLl...|$|R
40|$|Low density {{human plasma}} lipoproteins Sf 17 +, Sf 13, and Sf 6, high density lipoproteins 2 and 3, and a lipoprotein-free plasma protein {{fraction}} were isolated from human plasma by <b>ultracentrifugal</b> <b>methods.</b> It {{was found that}} human plasma lipoproteins are immunochemically distinct from the non-lipoprotein containing plasma protein fraction. Lipoprotein fractions of a given hydrated density, isolated from different individuals, {{were found to be}} immunochemically indistinguishable by qualitative absorption tests. Qualitative antigenic differences were shown to exist between low density lipoproteins and high density lipoproteins. Quantitative precipitin reactions showed that low density lipoproteins Sf 6 and Sf 13 were immunochemically very similar. However, they differed with respect to the amount of antigen nitrogen required for maximum precipitation. Agar diffusion analyses were performed; the results suggest heterogeneity of lipoproteins by this criterion...|$|R
40|$|An immunochemical technic {{has been}} found to be specific, {{efficient}} and repro-ducible in removing lipoproteins of density less than 1. 063 gm. /ml. from measured drops of human serum. Estimations of microcapillary columns of immunoprecipitate compare favorably with ultracentrifugal analysis of S 0 - 400 lipoproteins. An equa-tion derived from these data converts millimeters of lipoprotein precipitate into milligrams lipoprotein S 0 - 400 per 100 ml. serum. A highly significant difference was obtained between mean lipoprotein precipitate levels of a clinically healthy population and those of a group of patients with coronary artery disease or diabetes mellitus. A. VAILABLE EVIDENCE frequently points to an association of ather-osclerosis with impaired lipid metabolism (1). Estimations of serum glyceride as well as cholesterol appear valuable in distinguishing normal from atherosclerotic individuals (2, 3). A majority of these serum lipids are transported by low-density lipoproteins which have also been implicated in atherogenesis (4). Olson (5, 6) suggests not only that serum low-density lipoproteins are the agent for atheroscle-rosis, but also that this view may be defended according to Koch’s postulates. This relationship may be further clarified by development of technics which facilitate precise serum lipid and lipoprotein analyses.

40|$|By using trypsin-treated human type O cells as indicators, we {{compared}} the abilities of four polyanion-divalent cation combinations (heparin-MnCl 2; high-and low-molecular-weight dextran sulfate-CaCl 2; and sodium polyanetholesulfonate [SPS]-CaCl 2) for removal of serum non-immunoglobulin (lipoprotein) inhibitors of rubella hemagglutination. The combination of SPS-CaCl 2 {{was found to be}} the most effective, precipitating completely the pre-β and β-lipoproteins and reducing the α-lipoprotein levels by more than 50 %. Hemagglutination patterns after this treatment were clear and stable, and, when normal sera were tested, hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) titers were comparable to those obtained after standard heparin-MnCl 2 treatment. High-molecular-weight dextran sulfate-CaCl 2 removed serum lipoproteins almost as effectively as SPS-CaCl 2. However, problems of nonspecific agglutination and the heavy hemagglutination patterns resulting made this combination unacceptable for routine purposes. Neither low-molecular-weight dextran sulfate-CaCl 2 nor heparin-MnCl 2 removed the pre-β lipoproteins completely, and occasionally traces of β-lipoprotein also remained after treatment. The presence of pre-β lipoproteins in normal sera after treatment may be of no consequence in the HI test since we have found that the very-low-density lipoprotein fractions obtained by <b>ultracentrifugal</b> <b>methods</b> from normal sera (those corresponding to the pre-β fractions obtained by electrophoresis) had no HI activity. However, very-low-density lipoprotein fractions from all hyperlipemic sera tested had HI activity (titers ranging from 1 : 16 to 1 : 1, 024) which, in the majority of cases, was not eliminated after heparin-MnCl 2 treatment. In every case, treatment with SPS-CaCl 2 removed this nonspecific activity completely. Since hyperlipemic sera may occasionally be encountered in routine rubella HI antibody testing, we recommend the use of SPS-CaCl 2 rather than heparin-MnCl 2 for pretreatment of sera...|$|R
40|$|Normal human serum and a {{fraction}} rich in lipoprotein, Cohn fraction IV 1, {{have been shown}} in previous studies to detoxify native endotoxin by decreasing lethality for mice, fever in rabbits, and by the alteration of the characteristic endotoxin-anti-endotoxin precipitin pattern in gels. These studies are extended herein and document the ability of normal human serum and fraction IV 1 to neutralize the induction of hypotension in rabbits by viable gram-negative bacilli. Further fractionation of serum, using an <b>ultracentrifugal</b> flotation <b>method</b> for producing lipoprotein-free human serum and purified high-density lipoproteins, revealed the lipoprotein-free fraction {{to be capable of}} inhibiting endotoxin hypotensive activity and to alter diffusion of endotoxin in gels.

40|$|Part I: 1. A case is {{described}} and discussed {{in which a}} mutant strain of Neurospora which spontaneously reverts to wild type cannot be induced to revert by mutagenic agents. 2. The action of ultraviolet light on macroconidia of Neurospora {{is described}}. 3. The effect of heat and light post-treatment of ultra-violet irradiated macroconidia has been studied. 4. Data have been obtained which suggest that the killing effect of UV is more easily reversed by heat or light post-treatment than the mutagenic effect. Part II: 1. The soluble proteins of Escherichia coli were extracted by disrupting the bacteria in a colloid mill and centrifuging all particulate matter out of solution. 2. The soluble proteins so obtained, were resolved by electrophoresis. 3. A comparison {{was made of the}} electrophoretic scanning patterns of the soluble proteins of non-infected bacteria, bacteria infected with bacteriophage T 2 during the "eclipse" stage of infection, and bacteria infected for longer than the "eclipse" with, the following findings: a) The amount of free-moving desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) present in the extracts of uninfected bacteria decreases during the "eclipse" stage of infection. b) The amount of free-moving DNA increases strikingly {{after the end of the}} "eclipse. " 4. Bacteriophage particles were disrupted in the colloid mill. The increase in free moving DNA in the extracts of bacteria infected for longer than the "eclipse" was found to be due to disruption of intracellular bacteriophage particles. 5. DNA was extracted both from bacteriophage particles and from Escherichia coli. A comparison of the two DIVAS by electrophoretical and <b>ultracentrifugal</b> <b>methods</b> reveals a close similarity between them. 6.

40|$|It {{was pointed}} out some years ago (1 - 3) that studies on the purity of certain virus preparations, among other protein {{materials}} of biochemical interest, should utilize immunochemical methods {{as well as the}} less sensitive physicochemical procedures, such as the <b>ultracentrifugal</b> and electrophoretic <b>methods</b> of analyses. The importance of this was stressed from several points of view: (a) immunochemical methods are extraordinarily sensitive for the detection of certain antigenic impurities, (b) they provide several types of independent tests of homogeneity, and (c) particles bearing virus activity may on occasion be expected to contain antigenic groupings characteristic of the host from which they are derived. It has been shown that virus preparations of the influenza types (3 - 5), Rous sarcoma virus (1), equine encephalomyelitis virus (6), and others, indeed contain large amounts of host antigens. Among the influenza group, for instance, it was shown that the usual ultracentrifugal purification and analytical procedures were inadequate to remove or even reveal at concentrations of less than 0. 5 per cent between 20 to 5...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY-Mammary fragments, from agent. free C 57 BL mice {{in their}} first pregnancy, {{explanted}} in organ cultures {{in direct contact with}} agent-positive Rill milk and stimulated with hormones, presented large areas of invasive epithelial proliferation. A comparable growth response was obtained after the milk was heated at 70 ° C for 1 hour. Milks from agent· free C 57 BL and Ax mouse strains also induced a similar type of invasive hyperplasia in the fresh state or after exposure to heat. PuriRed viral B particles contained in fractions isolated from Rill milk by <b>ultracentrifugal</b> and electrophoretic <b>methods</b> did not induce invasive hyperplasia but stimu-lated growth and differentiation. It is concluded that the mammary tumor agent is not responsible for the induced invasive epithelial hyperplasia observed in the cultures. However, it might initiate the formation of the highly organized alveolar nodules that usually arise in the mammary glands of high-cancer strains after an incubation period of 4 to 6 months. Heat-labile, inhibiting fadors were detected in agent-free C 57 BL milk. They were also found in fresh milks of agent-positive Rill and A mice where their toxicity seemed greatly diminished. A possible relationship between the presence of such inhibitors and the relative infedive potency of the milk agent in different strains of mice is suggested. -J Nat Cancer Inst 34 : 141...|$|R
