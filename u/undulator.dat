40|$|Abstract: We {{describe}} the beamline optics, the shutters and the femtosecond laser used in pump & probe experiments down to 50 picosecond resolution. The performance of in-vacuum <b>undulators</b> {{is compared to}} in-air <b>undulators.</b> It is concluded that single-harmonic in-vacuum <b>undulators</b> are optimal for pump and probe experiments based on single-bunch exposures. These low-K <b>undulators</b> can produce a spectral flux of 4. 0 x 108 ph/ 0. 1 %bw per pulse at 15 keV, a factor of 5 higher than standard in-air <b>undulators.</b> The Laue diffraction study of the photolysis of CO in myoglobin is described. The study shows that high-level photolysis is possible with laser pulses as short as 100 fs and that the radiation damage from repeated x-ray and laser exposures is small. The success of the experiment indicates that the time-resolution of macro molecular crystallography may reach 200 fs with a future free electron laser (XFEL). Content...|$|R

5000|$|In synchrotrons and free-electron lasers, {{relativistic}} electrons were {{injected into}} an <b>undulator,</b> so that synchrotron radiation is generated. In the proper {{frame of the}} electrons, the <b>undulator</b> is contracted which leads to an increased radiation frequency. Additionally, {{to find out the}} frequency as measured in the laboratory frame, one has to apply the relativistic Doppler effect. So, only with the aid of length contraction and the relativistic Doppler effect, the extremely small wavelength of <b>undulator</b> radiation can be explained.|$|E
5000|$|This formula can be {{understood}} as a combination of two relativistic effects.

5000|$|An <b>undulator</b> is an {{insertion}} device from high-energy physics and usually {{part of a}} larger installation, a synchrotron storage ring, or it may be a component of a free electron laser. It consists of a periodic structure of dipole magnets.

50|$|The SASE process {{starts with}} an {{electron}} bunch being injected into an <b>undulator,</b> with a velocity {{close to the}} speed of light and a uniform density distribution within the bunch. In the <b>undulator</b> the electrons are wiggled and emit light characteristic of the <b>undulator</b> strength but within a certain energy bandwidth. The emitted photons travel slightly faster than the electrons and interact with them each <b>undulator</b> period. Depending on the phase to each other, electrons gain or lose energy (velocity), i.e. faster electrons catch up with slower ones. Thereby the electron bunch density is periodically modulated by the radiation which is called microbunching. The structured electron beam amplifies only certain photon energies at the cost of kinetic energy until the system goes into saturation. SASE energy spectra show a noise-like distribution of intense spikes on top of a lower-amplitude background. The micro-bunch structuring reduces the phase space available to the photons, thus they {{are also more likely to}} have a similar phase and the emitted beam is quasi-coherent.|$|E
