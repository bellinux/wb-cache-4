40|$|Indian NGOs {{have taken}} an {{important}} part in the water sector, in promoting participatory approaches and establishing local water <b>user</b> <b>groups.</b> However, recent water policy orientations are viewed by NGOs as a clear regress regarding participatory processes. <b>User</b> <b>groups</b> have no legal status and water management is attributed to Panchayati Raj Institutions which have limited means and competencies.

This <b>user</b> <b>grouping</b> scheme could be improved further, by introducing a second scheduling round that eliminates the few remaining cases with channel matrices with large singular value spread.
