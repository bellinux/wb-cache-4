40|$|Reproductive and {{urinary tract}} {{abnormalities}} are {{a cause of}} infertility, reproductive inefficiency, and economic losses in goats. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the occurrence and nature of reproductive and urinary tract abnormalities encountered in female goats slaughtered at Nyagatare abattoir in the Eastern Province of Rwanda. Reproductive and urinary organs from 369 female goat carcasses were opened by incision and then given a thorough macroscopic examination by visually inspecting and palpating for evidence of abnormalities. The results showed that there was an overall occurrence of 7. 8 % reproductive organ/tract abnormalities and 10. 6 % urinary organ/tract abnormalities. Ovarian hypoplasia was the reproductive abnormality with the highest overall occurrence (32. 3 %) and renal calculi were the <b>urinary</b> <b>organ</b> abnormality with the highest occurrence (38. 1 %). 95. 2 % of the reproductive organ/tract abnormalities observed usually result in infertility and 91. 3 % of the urinary organ/tract abnormalities observed result in economic losses through condemnation of kidneys at slaughter. The high incidence of the observed urinary organ/tract abnormalities represents a potential public health challenge. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of reproductive organ/tract abnormalities according to breed (p> 0. 05, n= 31).

40|$|BackgroundWe {{evaluated}} cancer incidence in {{a cohort}} of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposed workers. MethodsIncident cancers, identified using state registries, were compared to those in a national population using standardized incidence ratios. Trends in prostate cancer incidence with cumulative PCB exposure were evaluated using standardized rate ratios and Cox regression models. For selected sites, cumulative PCB exposure was compared between aggressive (fatal/distant stage) and localized/regional cancers. ResultsWe identified 3, 371 invasive first primary cancer diagnoses among 21, 317 eligible workers through 2007. Overall relative incidence was reduced. Elevations were only observed for respiratory cancers and among women, <b>urinary</b> <b>organ</b> cancers. Among men, prostate cancer incidence was reduced and not associated with cumulative PCB exposure although median exposures were significantly higher for aggressive compared to localized/regional prostate cancers. ConclusionPreviously observed associations between cumulative PCB exposure and prostate cancer mortality were not confirmed in this analysis; prostate cancer stage at diagnosis may explain the discrepancy.

40|$|Background: We {{investigated}} {{cancer risk}} among patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and whether variation by age at MS diagnosis helps to elucidate mechanisms underlying the previously reported reduced cancer risk. We also studied cancer risk among parents to ascertain if MS susceptibility genes may confer protection against cancer in relatives. Methods: Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for age, sex, area, and socioeconomic index, estimated cancer risk among 20, 276 patients with MS and 203, 951 individuals without MS, using Swedish general population register data. Similar {{analyses were conducted}} among 11, 284 fathers and 12, 006 mothers of patients with MS, compared with 123, 158 fathers and 129, 409 mothers of controls. Results: With an average of 35 years of follow-up, there was a decreased overall cancer risk among patients with MS (hazard ratio = 0. 91, 0. 87 - 0. 95). Increased risks were observed for brain tumors (1. 44, 1. 21 - 1. 72) and <b>urinary</b> <b>organ</b> cancer (1. 27, 1. 05 - 1. 53). Parents of patients with MS {{did not have a}} notably increased or decreased overall cancer risk. Conclusions: The reduction in cancer risk in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) may result from behavioral change, treatment, or we speculate that some immunologic characteristics of MS disease activity improve antitumor surveillance. The lack of association among parents indicatesthat a simple inherited characteristic is unlikely to explain the reduced cancer risk among patients with MS. MS is associated with increased risk for some cancers, such as of urinary organs and brain tumors (although surveillance bias may be responsible). copyright © by AAN Enterprises, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{national}} survey in Taiwan {{has shown that}} Chinese herbal therapy {{increases the risk of}} chronic kidney disease. However, it is unknown whether herbal therapy will increase the risk of urological cancers. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether Chinese herbalists are at higher risk for urological cancers. Methods: We studied all Chinese herbalists in Taiwan that were registered in the Chinese Herbalist Labor Union between 1985 and 2000. We retrospectively followed their survival status and causes of death using the National Mortality Registry Database from 1985 to 2004. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for urological cancers in herbalists were calculated and compared with those of the general population of Taiwan. Results: A total of 6548 Chinese herbalists were enrolled and 88, 289 person-years were accrued during the observation period. After adjustment for age and sex, the SMR for urological cancers was significantly higher for Chinese herbalists than for the general population (SMR = 3. 10; 95 % CI: 1. 41 – 5. 87). When further stratified by location, the SMR for kidney cancer and other <b>urinary</b> <b>organ</b> cancers (SMR = 3. 81; 95 % CI: 1. 39 – 8. 28) except bladder cancer (SMR = 2. 26; 95 % CI: 0. 47 – 6. 59) were significantly higher for the Chinese herbalists. The SMR for chronic and unspecified nephritis, renal failure, and renal sclerosis were also significantly higher for herbalists (SMR = 2. 40; 95 % CI: 1. 40 – 3. 84). Conclusions: Chinese herbalists have a significantly higher risk for urological cancers. This increased risk among herbalists highlights the urgent need for safety assessments of Chinese herbs.

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the levels of}} arsenic in drilled wells in Finland and studied the association of arsenic exposure with the risk of bladder and kidney cancers. The study persons were selected fom a register-based cohort of all Finns who had lived at an address outside the municipal d-water system during 1967 - 1980 (n = 144, 627). The final study population consisted of 61 bladder cancer cases and 49 kidney cancer cases diagnosed between 1981 and 1995, {{as well as an}} age- and sex-balanced random sample of 275 subjects (reference cohort). Water samples were obtained from the wells used by the study population at least during 1967 - 1980. The total arsenc concentrations in the wells of the reference cohort were low (median = 0. 1 pgIL; maximum = 64 pg/L), and 1 % / exceeded 10 pg/L. Arsenic exposure was estimated as arsenic concentrationin the well, daily dose, and cumutiv dose of arsenic. None of the exposuire indicators was st ll significantly associated with the risk of kddney cancer. Bladder cancer tended to be associted with arsenic concentration and daily dose during the third to ninth years prior to the cancer diagnosis; the risk ratios for arsnic concentration categories 0. 14. 5 and 0. 5 pWL relative to the category with c 0. 1 pg/L we 1. 53 [95 % coniden interval (CI), 0. 75 - 3. 09] nd 2. 4 (CI, 1. 1 - 5. 37), respectively.

40|$|The complex {{network of}} {{etiological}} factors, signals and tissue responses involved in chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) cannot be successfully targeted {{by a single}} therapeutic agent. Multimodal approaches to the therapy of CP/CPPS have been and are currently being tested, as {{in the frame of}} complex diagnostic-therapeutic phenotypic approaches such as the urinary, psychosocial, organ-specific, infection, neurological and muscle tenderness (UPOINTS) system. In this study, the effect of combination therapy on 914 patients diagnosed, phenotyped and treated in a single specialized prostatitis clinic was analyzed. Patients received α-blockers, Serenoa repens (S. repens) extracts combined or not with supplements (lycopene and selenium) and, in the presence of documented or highly suspected infection, antibacterial agents. Combination treatment induced marked and significant improvements of National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) prostatitis symptom scores, International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) sexual dysfunction scores, urinary peak flow rates and bladder voiding efficiency. These improvements, assessed after a 6 -month course of therapy, were sustained throughout a follow-up period of 18 months. A clinically appreciable reduction of ≥ 6 points of the total NIH-CPSI score was achieved in 77. 5 % of patients subjected to combination therapy for a period of 6 months. When the patients were divided in two cohorts, depending on the diagnosis of CP/CPPS [inflammatory (IIIa) vs. non-inflammatory (IIIb) subtypes], significant improvements of all signs and symptoms of the syndrome were observed in both cohorts at the end of therapy. Intergroup comparison showed that patients affected by the IIIa sub-category of CP/CPPS showed more severe signs and symptoms (NIH-CPSI total, pain and quality of life impact scores, and Qmax) at baseline when compared with IIIb patients. However, the improvement of symptoms after therapy was significantly more pronounced in IIIa patients when compared with IIIb patients. In contrast to current opinion, the evidence emerging from the present investigation suggests that the inflammatory and non-inflammatory sub-categories of CP/CPPS may represent two distinct pathological conditions or, alternatively, two different stages of the same condition. In conclusion, a simple protocol based on α-blockers, S. repens extracts and supplements and antibacterial agents, targeting the <b>urinary,</b> <b>organ</b> specific and infection domains of UPOINTS, may induce a clinically appreciable improvement of the signs and symptoms of CP/CPPS in a considerable percentage of patients. In patients not responding sufficiently to such therapy, second-line agents (antidepressants, anxiolytics, muscle relaxants, 5 -phosphodiesterase inhibitors and others) may be administered in order to achieve a satisfactory therapeutic response...|$|E
