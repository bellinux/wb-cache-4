5|$|Smuts's {{engagement}} with politics {{was very much}} a product of his time at Stellenbosch. While his parent's political moderation and rejection of Afrikaner exclusivism had left him largely <b>unencumbered</b> <b>by</b> any innate prejudices, it was his time at Victoria College which saw him develop his own independent political outlook. These views developed in tandem with another of Smuts's fixations, his philosophical pursuit of the embodiment of unity. This intellectual quest was later to develop into his philosophy of Holism, but even at this early undeveloped stage he brought these ideas to bear in shaping his political opinions. So it was that Smuts emerged as an outspoken supporter of South African unity, and, by extension, a supporter of Rhodes.|$|E

In other respects, his address was gallant, free, and <b>unencumbered</b> either <b>by</b> pride or ceremony--far remote certainly from the charge either of haughty coldness or forward impetuosity; and so far his father had justly freed him from the marked faults which he ascribed to the manners of the prince and his favourite Buckingham.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Desirable {{application}} {{performance is}} typically guaranteed {{through the use}} of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that specify fixed fractions of resource capacities that must be allocated for <b>unencumbered</b> use <b>by</b> the application. The mapping between what constitutes desirable performance and SLAs is not unique: multiple SLA expressions might be functionally equivalent. Having the flexibility to transform SLAs from one form to another {{in a manner that is}} provably safe would enable hosting solutions to achieve significant efficiencies. This paper demonstrates the promise of such an approach by proposing a type-theoretic framework for the representation and safe transformation of SLAs. Based on that framework, the paper describes a methodical approach for the inference of efficient and safe mappings of periodic, real-time tasks to the physical and virtual hosts that constitute a hierarchical scheduler. Extensive experimental results support the conclusion that the flexibility afforded by safe SLA transformations has the potential to yield significant savings. I...|$|R

While the document left the liberties of the Polish nobles untouched, it granted increased power to the boyars of Lithuania, whose grand dukes had till then been <b>unencumbered</b> <b>by</b> checks and balances of the sort attached to the Polish monarchy.

40|$|Digital {{stewardship}} is {{the active}} and long-term management of digital objects towards their preservation for and <b>unencumbered</b> access <b>by</b> future generations. Although {{the field is}} rapidly maturing, it still lacks a comprehensive competency profile for practitioners. This {{is due in part}} to the relative youth of the field, and to the fact that being an effective steward of digital materials requires highly specialized training that is best acquired through hands-on work. Given the key role that competency profiles play in the design of curricula and job postings, the lack of one hinders the training and education of professionals for these positions. This paper provides a profile of the skills, responsibilities, and knowledge areas that define competency in digital stewardship, based on a close study of the projects undertaken in the National Digital Stewardship Residency program (NDSR). The authors use a triangulated research methodology in order to define the scope of the profile, qualitatively analyze the competencies articulated among NDSR project descriptions, and quantitatively evaluate those competencies’ importance to professional success. The profile that results from this research has implications for current and future digital stewards: training designed with this profile as its basis will focus on the skills most needed to be an effective digital steward, and therefore can guide both graduate and professional development curricula alike...|$|R

We cur-rently focus on spatiotemporal control of odor, rather than capturing and synthesizing odor itself. If we simply diffused the odor into the atmosphere, {{it would be difficult to}} clean it away in a short time. Several olfactory displays that inject the scented air under the nose through tubes have been pro-posed to realize spatiotemporal control of olfaction, but they require the user to wear something on one’s face.

40|$|This Note {{explores the}} role that nongovernmental {{organizations}} can and do play in the preservation of global biodiversity hotspots. The hotspot concept-developed in the late 1980 s alongside the new field of conservation biology-identifies particular {{areas of the world}} that contain high levels of endemic species that are highly threatened or endangered. Some experts have argued that by focusing species conservation efforts on these areas, a maximum amount of species can be protected and preserved using a minimum amount of time, money, and effort, allowing the remaining, scarce funds and resources to be directed toward species conservation efforts elsewhere. Without commenting on the propriety or the effectiveness of utilizing the hotspot concept itself as a way to focus biodiversity conservation efforts, this Note examines several methods that nongovernmental organizations can use to assist in the protection of such hotspots. The first category of such methods includes direct funding efforts or the making of <b>unencumbered</b> contributions <b>by</b> nongovernmental organizations to other organizations in a position to affect preservation efforts in a particular hotspot. The second category includes all types of nongovernmental organization involvement in debt-for-nature swaps. The third category includes a broad array of opportunities for nongovernmental organization involvement in the international arena, including involvement with both public and private or semi-private international organizations. In an ever-more globalized and interconnected world, the actions of such organizations increasingly affect hotspot preservation. The effectiveness of each of these three categories of potential and current involvement will be analyzed and opportunities for future expansion of protection efforts will be presented...|$|R
40|$|In hosting environments such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) clouds, {{desirable}} application {{performance is}} typically guaranteed {{through the use}} of Service Level Agreements (SLAs), which specify minimal fractions of resource capacities that must be allocated by a service provider for <b>unencumbered</b> use <b>by</b> customers to ensure proper operation of their workloads. Most IaaS offerings are presented to customers as fixed-size and fixed-price SLAs, that do not match well the needs of specific applications. Furthermore, arbitrary colocation of applications with different SLAs may result in inefficient utilization of hosts' resources, resulting in economically undesirable customer behavior. In this thesis, we propose the design and architecture of a Colocation as a Service (CaaS) framework: a set of strategic and operational services that allow the efficient colocation of customer workloads. CaaS strategic services provide customers the means to specify their application workload using an SLA language that provides them the opportunity and incentive to take advantage of any tolerances they may have regarding the scheduling of their workloads. CaaS operational services provide the information necessary for, and carry out the reconfigurations mandated by strategic services. We recognize that it could be the case that there are multiple, yet functionally equivalent ways to express an SLA. Thus, towards that end, we present a service that allows the provably-safe transformation of SLAs from one form to another for the purpose of achieving more efficient colocation. Our CaaS framework could be incorporated into an IaaS offering by providers or it could be implemented as a value added proposition by IaaS resellers. To establish the practicality of such offerings, we present a prototype implementation of our proposed CaaS framework...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{evolution}} of the pediatric hospitals from an architectural point of view starting from the early Twentieth Century. Furthermore the architectonic organization is strictly related to the spread of infectious diseases because until the half of the last century the mortality rate of hospedalized children was very high. The primary concern of pediatric hospitals was so to limit and to impede as much as possible hospital contagion. To separate the areas dedicated to treatment and hospitalization, and to build separate and isolated pavilions, ventilated and surounded <b>by</b> <b>unencumbered</b> green areas, are some of the building solutions that have been realized in the past. The model of pavilion hospital was so determined, and dominated hospital constructions until the 1960 ’s- 1970 ’s. Although hospital contagion still represents an important problem today in pediatric hospitals due to the fragile nature of the patients, {{at the beginning of the}} century doctors, when faced with wide-spread contagion due to the ineffectiveness of the treatment of infections, consolidated the practice of separating the ill, subdividing the hospital wards into “cubicles”, i. e. small individual rooms in place of large common rooms.

This study investigated the impact of plagiarism detection services on the teacher-student relationship as it pertains to trust. The study involved one school in Northern Illinois. The sample of participants was limited to students, teachers, and an administrator who were familiar with plagiarism detection services. This mixed methodology study assessed perceptions of students, teachers, and the department chair. Quantitative data consisted of a survey. Qualitative data were collected from a student focus group as well as teacher and department chair interviews. Additional qualitative information was garnered through an open-ended response question on the survey. Quantitative and qualitative results suggest teachers and the department chair feel the plagiarism detection service does not hinder the teacher-student relationship. Quantitative results indicate that students slightly disagree with teacher and administrative views. Qualitative results additionally suggest that students feel the service negatively impacts their relationship with their instructor. Learning communities appear to operate most effectively when they are pervaded <b>by</b> <b>unencumbered</b> trust. The data indicate that student perceptions of the plagiarism detection service impact the teacher-student relationship and therefore hinder the learning community. This study serves to initiate further probing into the fragile trust relationship that exists between instructors and pupils and the many factors that may impact that relationship. To date, little research exists on the impact of plagiarism detection services.

40|$|The {{elderly in}} Russia {{have often been}} among those least {{able to cope with}} all the changes that have taken place during the transition. Unlike the {{situation}} prior to reform-when pensions were stable-they now face considerable uncertainty. If they have not been in poverty, many have been close to it. While the elderly have experienced difficulties, they have also been the beneficiaries of a very large transfer of wealth. In Russia, as in most transition economies, housing was privatized, under giveaway terms. As a result, although many elderly households have low incomes, based on their wealth, their deprivation would appear to be less serious. Unfortunately, {{in the absence of a}} developed financial system, it is difficult to use this wealth without selling it. In Russia, all households, not just the elderly, have not been able to borrow. The existence of such large <b>unencumbered</b> wealth holdings <b>by</b> lower income elderly households creates an opportunity to provide what might be termed"housing safety net insurance"at low public cost. More than reducing the incidence of poverty, such schemes could allow also many of the elderly to be able to move out of poverty and into middle income status. The authors explain why many of the elderly in the former Soviet Union (FSU), not just in Russia, are likely to have so much housing wealth. Then they discuss how financial instruments could access this wealth. The authors also discuss the empirical situation of the elderly in Moscow, illustrating the potential demand for such products. Finally, they suggest that the results for Moscow are likely to be similar in many other FSU countries because these countries also have elderly populations who also own a great deal of unencumbered housing wealth.
