Seven hundred and forty kilograms (1630lb) of essential weight was thus lost {{in the first few}} minutes. Before it was well clear of the launch site, the Eagle had turned from a supposedly steerable craft into an ordinary hydrogen balloon with a few ropes hanging from it, {{at the mercy of the}} wind; its crew had no means to direct it to any particular goal and had too little ballast for stability. Lightened, the balloon rose to 700meters (2300ft), an unimagined height, where the lower air pressure made the hydrogen escape all the faster through the eight million little holes.|$|E

25|$|The initial view, {{reported}} by Horace Smith-Dorrien, {{was that the}} British had difficulty unpacking their ammunition boxes fast enough and that the quartermasters were reluctant to distribute ammunition to units other than their own. Well-equipped and well-trained British soldiers could fire 10–12 rounds a minute. The lack of ammunition caused a lull in the defence and, in subsequent engagements with the Zulus, ammunition boxes were <b>unscrewed</b> in advance for rapid distribution. Numerous first hand accounts indicate ammunition was available and being supplied, including Smith-Dorrien's earliest {{in a letter to}} his father.|$|E

25|$|HK commercially markets the MK 23 and {{derivatives}} of it, but not {{the complete}} SOCOM system. The suppressor is made by Knight's Armament Company, and was selected over the one HK originally included {{as part of its}} entry. Insight Technology won the contract to produce the laser aiming module, later designated AN/PEQ-6. One version of the LAM produces a visible light dot, while another produces an infrared dot that can only be seen through night vision goggles. There have since been different LAM models and, at least commercially, different suppressors as well. It has been reported by some users that the cumulative effects of recoil may occasionally cause the can of the suppressor to become slightly <b>unscrewed,</b> but that it is relatively easy to improvise solutions for the problem.|$|E
25|$|Made by Dorman & Smith Ltd. (using patents {{applied for}} in 1943) the {{plugs and sockets}} were rated at 13A and {{were one of the}} {{competing}} types for use on ring final circuits. They were never popular in private houses but were widely deployed in prefabricated houses and council housing. The BBC also used them. Some local authorities continued to use them in new installations until the late 1950s. Many D sockets were still in use until the early 1980s, although the difficulty in obtaining plugs for them after around 1970 often forced their users to replace them with BS1363 sockets. The D plug suffered from a serious design fault: the line pin was a fuse which screwed into the plug body and tended to come <b>unscrewed</b> on its own in use. A fuse that worked loose could end up protruding from the socket, electrically live and posing a shock hazard, when the plug was removed.|$|E

The b-side of the vinyl was pressed with a double-groove, so that either [...] "Girl Don't Come" [...] or [...] "Sleep" [...] played depending on where the stylus landed; the songs were shorter on the vinyl than {{they were on the}} CD or cassette formats to accommodate both {{on one side of the}} disc. This pressing was limited to 5,000 copies. The original design for the vinyl was for the sleeve to be made from wood, or corrugated cardboard, with wing-nuts in each corner like a flower-press. The nuts would have to have been <b>unscrewed</b> to find the vinyl disc inside - between ten layers of different types of cardboard.|$|E

500|$|The Allman Brothers Band was {{recorded}} and mixed in two weeks, {{and according to}} biographer Alan Paul, [...] "virtually no outtakes exist from the sessions." [...] The band had performed their songs countless times in the preceding months and [...] " [...] them down cold." [...] Numerous artists, including Ray Charles, had recorded on the studio's house Hammond organ, but Gregg Allman set up his own instead, feeling unable {{to play on the}} same instrument as Charles. A red light on the recording board would go on when the band began recording, and it made Gregg Allman nervous; in order to perform takes as needed, he <b>unscrewed</b> the light. The two-week booking was initially designed for laying down basic tracks, with overdubs following later, but the group ended up cutting the entire record in six non-consecutive days. They first entered Atlantic Studios that Sunday night (August 3) to [...] "get sounds"; the band laid down the album's openers, [...] "Don’t Want You No More" [...] and [...] "It's Not My Cross to Bear", as well as [...] "Dreams," [...] which the band set aside.

The thieves then removed the mounted canvas from its frame and left the gallery undetected. McCaughey stated that a specialised type of screwdriver not {{available to the public}} would have been required to take the painting off the wall. It has been suggested that the thieves knew their art history: the method of the theft was an ironic homage to the 1911 theft of the Mona Lisa from the Louvre.

2500|$|Some {{appliances}} {{sold in the}} Soviet Union had a flat unearthed plug with {{an additional}} pass-through socket on the top, allowing a stacked arrangement of plugs. This design was very useful, because the usual Soviet apartment of the 1960s had very few sockets, but somewhat unsafe; [...] the brass cylinders of the secondary socket were uncovered at the ends (to {{allow them to be}} <b>unscrewed</b> easily), recessed by only 3mm, and provided bad contact because they relied on the secondary plug's bisected expanding pins. The pins of the secondary plug (which lacked insulation sleeves) could not be inserted into the cylindrical sockets completely, leaving a 5mm gap between the primary and secondary plugs. The adaptors were mostly used for low power appliances (for example, connecting both a table lamp and a radio to a socket).|$|E

2500|$|The non-fatal {{incident}} occurred on 8 May 1951. It involved a Hunting Air Travel Vickers 639 Viking 1 (registration: G-AHPD) operating an international scheduled passenger flight from Bordeaux Mérignac to RAF Bovingdon. Following an uneventful takeoff from Mérignac, the no. 1 engine suddenly {{began to lose}} power when the aircraft climbed through [...] and the pilot in command throttled down to initial climbing speed. The pilot then shut down the malfunctioning engine, feathered the propeller and applied full power to the no. 2 engine {{to compensate for the}} loss of engine no. 1. However, this was insufficient to maintain altitude and led to the flightdeck crew's decision to execute a gear-up landing. When the aircraft touched the ground, it slid for about [...] before coming to a halt. There were no fatalities among the 32 occupants (five crew and 27 passengers). Accident investigators established the probable cause as the disconnecting of the articulated control rod of the propeller governor {{due to the lack of}} a split pin on the governor spindle, and due to the nut of the ball joint of the control spindle having been <b>unscrewed</b> by force.|$|E
