40|$|Abstract. The {{strength}} {{properties of the}} rock under <b>unloading</b> conditions are essentially different from the rock under loading conditions. At present, the study on the mechanical properties of <b>unloading</b> rock mass is common, but the research for <b>unloading</b> {{strength properties}} of jointed rock mass, especially the influence of structural plane on <b>unloading</b> strength is seldom. The paper studied the failure characters of <b>unloading</b> rock mass, and the influences of structural plane properties on <b>unloading</b> strength based on triaxial test are considered emphatically. Finally the strength criterion of <b>unloading</b> rock mass is proposed in this paper...|$|R

5|$|Another such ill-fated {{settlement}} was Canemah, {{located near the}} Willamette Falls. Canemah prospered until 1861, when the same great flood swept most of the town over the falls. Even after reconstruction, much of the town's importance to river commerce ended in 1873 with completion of the Willamette Falls Locks. Ships no longer needed to dock and <b>unload</b> goods and passengers for portage around the falls. The remaining town officially survived until 1929, when it was annexed to Oregon City.|$|E

40|$|Particle-reinforced rubbers {{exhibit a}} marked stress {{softening}} during <b>unloading</b> after loading in uniaxial tension tests, i. e. {{the stress on}} <b>unloading</b> is significantly less than that on loading at the same stretch. This hysteretic behaviour is not accounted for when the mechanical. properties are represented {{in terms of a}} strain-energy function, i. e. if the material is modelled as hyperelastic. In this paper a theory of pseudo-elasticity is used to model loading, partial or complete <b>unloading</b> and the subsequent reloading and <b>unloading</b> of reinforced rubber. The basis of the model is the inclusion in the energy function of a variable that enables the energy function to be changed as the deformation path changes between loading, partial <b>unloading,</b> reloading and any further <b>unloading.</b> The dissipation of energy, i. e. the difference between the energy input during loading and the energy returned on <b>unloading</b> is accounted for in the model by the use of a dissipation function, the form of which changes between <b>unloading,</b> reloading and subsequent <b>unloading...</b>|$|R
40|$|The pathway of phloem <b>unloading</b> in sink barley (Hordeum vulgare) leaves was studied using a {{combination}} of electron microscopy, carboxyfluorescein transport, and systemic movement of barley stripe mosaic virus expressing the green fluorescent protein. Studies of plasmodesmatal frequencies between the phloem and mesophyll indicated a symplastic sieve element- (SE) <b>unloading</b> pathway involving thick-walled and thin-walled SEs. Phloem-translocated carboxyfluorescein was <b>unloaded</b> rapidly from major longitudinal veins and entered the mesophyll cells of sink leaves. <b>Unloading</b> was “patchy” along the length of a vein, indicating that sieve element <b>unloading</b> may be discontinuous along a single vascular bundle. This pattern was mirrored precisely by the <b>unloading</b> of barley stripe mosaic virus expressing the green fluorescent protein. Transverse veins were not utilized in the <b>unloading</b> process.

40|$|In this study, nanoindentation {{technique}} {{was used to}} determine the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) with a glass transition temperature of 29 °C. Nanoindentation was conducted with a Berkovich nanoindenter tip under the same constant loading rate but different <b>unloading</b> rates. The Burgers nonlinear viscoelastic model was implemented in ABAQUS/Standard finite element code by means of a user-defined subroutine. After fitting the complete load-displacement curves, parameters in the nonlinear Maxwell and Voigt elements were obtained to describe the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of PVAc. The results show that PVAc exhibits negative <b>unloading</b> stiffness under low <b>unloading</b> rates. However, if the <b>unloading</b> rate is higher than 0. 1 mN/s, PVAc appears more elastic behavior. The nonlinear Burgers model used can successfully model the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of PVAc at different <b>unloading</b> rates, including the <b>unloading</b> nose associated with negative <b>unloading</b> slope at slow <b>unloading</b> rate for a highly viscoelastic material...|$|R
5|$|Because {{bulk cargo}} is so {{difficult}} to discharge, bulkers {{spend more time in}} port than other ships. A study of mini-bulkers found that it takes, on average, twice as much time to <b>unload</b> a ship as it does to load it. A mini-bulker spends 55hours at a time in port, compared to 35hours for a lumber carrier of similar size. This time in port increases to 74hours for Handymax and 120hours for Panamax vessels. Compared with the 12-hour turnarounds common for container ships, 15-hour turnarounds for car carriers, and 26-hour turnarounds for large tankers, bulker crews have more opportunities to spend time ashore.|$|E

40|$|Skeletal <b>unloading</b> induces loss of {{bone mineral}} density in {{weight-bearing}} bones. The objectives {{of this study}} were to characterize the post-translational modifications of collagen of weight-bearing bones subjected to hindlimb <b>unloading</b> for 8 weeks. In <b>unloaded</b> bones, tibiae and femurs, while the overall amino acid composition was essentially identical in the <b>unloaded</b> and control tibiae and femurs, the collagen cross-link profile showed significant differences. Two major reducible cross-links (analyzed as dihydroxylysinonorleucine and hydroxylysinonorleucine) were increased in the <b>unloaded</b> bones. In addition, the ratios of the former to the latter as well as pyridinoline to deoxypyridinoline were significantly decreased in the <b>unloaded</b> bones indicating a difference in the extent of lysine hydroxylation at the cross-linking sites between these two groups. These results indicate that upon skeletal <b>unloading</b> the relative pool of newly synthesized collagen is increased and it is post-translationally altered. The alteration could be associated with impaired osteoblastic differentiation induced by skeletal <b>unloading</b> that results in a mineralization defect...|$|R

5|$|A hatch or {{hatchway}} is {{the opening}} {{at the top of}} a cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow hatches to be opened and closed are called hatch cover. In general, hatch covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently load and <b>unload</b> cargo, hatches must be large, but large hatches present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the hatches, and these areas must be reinforced. Often, hatch areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|E

He cut his losses and avoided the stigma of financial failure for himself and the conservative political movement by giving away the paper outright to two men who worked for him as printers, William Thompson and William Victor.

5|$|Early in 1944, with an Allied {{invasion}} of Nazi-occupied Europe becoming ever more likely, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel {{was assigned to}} improve the wall's defences. Believing the existing coastal fortifications to be entirely inadequate, he immediately began strengthening them. Rommel's main concern was Allied air power. He had seen it first-hand when fighting the British and Americans in North Africa, and it had left a profound impression on him. He feared that any German counterattack would be broken up by Allied aircraft long before it could make a difference. Under his direction, hundreds of reinforced concrete pillboxes were built on the beaches, or sometimes slightly inland, to house machine guns, antitank guns, and light and heavy artillery. Land mines and antitank obstacles were planted on the beaches, and underwater obstacles and naval mines were placed in waters just offshore. The intent was to destroy the Allied landing craft before they could <b>unload</b> on the beaches.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{invasion}} of Guam, 3rd Battalion spent two months conducting 'mopping up' operations on the island until November, when it received orders to prepare for operations against Iwo Jima.

During the Battle of Iwo Jima, 3rd Battalion, as part of 3rd Marines, was kept offshore as the Expeditionary Troops reserve. However, despite numerous requests from other Marine officers, the 3rd Marines were never landed. According to one 3rd Battalion veteran, some Marines from the battalion came ashore to <b>unload</b> supplies or with other units that they had recently transferred to. After sitting off Iwo Jima in their transport ships for a month, the 3rd Marines were ordered to return to Guam on 5 March 1945.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{dislocation}} climb on plastic deformation during loading and <b>unloading</b> are studied using a two-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics model. Simulations are performed for polycrystalline thin films passivated on both surfaces. Dislocation climb lowers the {{overall level of}} the stress inside thin films and reduces the work hardening rate. Climb decreases the density of dislocations in pile-ups and reduces back stresses. These factors result in a smaller Bauschinger effect on <b>unloading</b> compared to simulations without climb. As dislocations continue to climb {{at the onset of}} <b>unloading</b> and the dislocation density continues to increase, the initial <b>unloading</b> slope increases with decreasing <b>unloading</b> rate. Because climb disperses dislocations, fewer dislocations are annihilated during <b>unloading,</b> leading to a higher dislocation density {{at the end of the}} <b>unloading</b> step.
