5|$|Though {{based on}} a technicality, the Blyew case set a {{precedent}} {{in state and federal}} courts that led to the erosion of Congress's Thirteenth Amendment powers.

5|$|Halo 4 {{takes place}} in a futuristic science fiction setting in the year 2557, four years after the events of Halo 3.

Following a war with the parasitic Flood, the humans came into conflict with the Forerunners, a powerful race that <b>upheld</b> <b>a</b> policy of benevolent shepherding of other races known as the Mantle of Responsibility. Humanity had begun an aggressive campaign of destroying any Flood infestations on a planet, which was misinterpreted as a desire for conquest. After centuries of war the Forerunners defeated the humans, ancestors of the contemporary human race, and stripped them of their technology and empire. The Forerunners soon fought the Flood themselves; after exhausting every other strategic option available to them, the Forerunners activated weapons of mass destruction known as the Halo Array. The Array's firing killed all sentient life in the galaxy to deprive the Flood of their food. Life that the Forerunners cataloged was then reseeded throughout the galaxy.|$|E
