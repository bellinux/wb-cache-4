In the same vein, contrary to what United States v.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} an ethnography and critical phenomenology of undocumentedness in the Swedish context. By {{attending to the}} forces and processes that circumscribe the life-worlds of <b>undocumented</b> <b>persons,</b> {{as well as the}} phenomenology and essential experiences of their condition, a complex and multi-layered illustration of what undocumentedness is and means is successively presented. Employing a dual conceptualization of the state, as a juridico-political construct as well as a practiced and embodied set of institutions, the undocumented position emerges as a legal category defined only through omission, produced and reproduced through administrative routine and practice. The health care sector provides empirical examples of state-undocumented interaction where the physical and corporeal presence of the officially absent becomes irrefutable. This research suggests that the Swedish welfare state – universalistic, comprehensive and with digitized administrative routines – becomes a particularly austere environment in which to be undocumented. Drawing on interviews with regional and local health care administrators, NGO-clinics’ representatives and health professionals, as well as extensive participatory observation and interviews with <b>undocumented</b> <b>persons,</b> I argue that the undocumented condition is characterized by simultaneous absence and presence, and a correspondingly paradoxical spatiality. I suggest that the official absence and deportability of <b>undocumented</b> <b>persons</b> deprives them of the capacity to define space and, in an Arendtian sense, appear as themselves to others. There are, however, some opportunities for embodied political protest and dissensus. The paradoxical qualities of the absent-present condition manipulate the undocumented mode of being-in-the-world and I argue that alienation and disorientation are essential experiences of the undocumented situation. ...|$|R

5000|$|On September 23, 2013, the Dominican Republic Constitutional Court {{ruled that}} {{children}} born to non-citizens in the Dominican Republic after 1929 are not and have never been citizens of the Dominican Republic. Since 23010 the DR constitution has denied citizenship to any non-citizen born [...] "in transit", but the court extended that language to cover any <b>undocumented</b> <b>person</b> resident in the DR and their descendants. The ruling affects 458,233 Haitian workers living in the Dominican Republic and it can leave more than 200,000 people stateless. One analysis reported that the court decision created the fifth largest groups of stateless people in the world. A group of writers who protested the ruling compared its impact to apartheid and said it represented [...] "the reinstating of the old racism that many have fought against". They described its impact: Dominicans born after 1929 to parents who are not of Dominican ancestry are to have their citizenship revoked. The ruling affects an estimated 250,000 Dominican people of Haitian descent, including many who have had no personal connection with Haiti for several generations. The government of the DR said the decision would allow for the proper documentation of non-citizens and allow the government to establish clearly their means of becoming legal residents of the DR. Advocates for the stateless criticized the DR's procedures as inadequate and ill-suited to an impoverished rural population that lacked the required birth registration records.|$|E

The resulting breadth of research is impressive and includes such topics as gender and migration, migration and development, refugees and transnationalism. However, this work still suffers from the limitations imposed by existing migration theories that privilege the host context over the sending context focusing on linear processes and bounded conceptual frameworks. Through field work with Ugandan migrants and their descendants in Britain, this paper challenges existing theoretical limitations by proposing an inter-disciplinary approach that draws on transnationalism, diaspora and cultural geographical perspectives on landscape. Through this lens the concept of diasporic landscape emerges as an innovative contribution to migration theory as it highlights the embeddedness of migrants’ lives, within processes of production and reproduction of a discursive terrain that straddles Uganda and Britain. It captures the multi-faceted physical and symbolic impacts of migrants’ lived realities and privileges the continued impact of the sending context, cultural and temporal dimensions. The contours that emerge through migrants’ everyday practices of ‘belonging’ highlight asymmetric power relations. These shift in complex patterns disrupting such bounded notions as migration, immobility, the migrant, non-migrant, refugee, citizen or <b>undocumented</b> <b>person...</b>|$|E

Another result was that the hidden meeting with health care professionals is not problem in itself but being refused to care is problematic. Controlled documents from health professionals page allows hidden may feel at a disadvantage. In this case crated anxiety and fear among the hidden people seeking care.

40|$|Master of ArtsDepartment of EconomicsTracy M. TurnerThe report {{examines}} the fiscal impact of <b>undocumented</b> <b>persons</b> at the federal, state, {{and local levels}} in order to explain the likely effects of an amnesty program. The report first provides background on the population of <b>undocumented</b> <b>persons</b> in the United States and {{an overview of the}} laws which govern their status. Details of past and current amnesty legislation are given. The channels through which undocumented immigrants have a fiscal impact on the three levels of government in the United States are explained. The paper discusses the economic theory relating to immigration and its effect on economic growth. Published works on the fiscal impact of the undocumented on state and local budgets and on federal programs such as social security are reviewed. The research reviewed includes an analysis of the long-term fiscal impact of immigrants. Undocumented immigrants impose a net cost {{at the state and local}} levels in most cases. However, many undocumented immigrants make income and payroll tax payments and the population of undocumented immigrants imposes a net benefit at the federal level. These sources of information are then used to explain how an amnesty program might change the fiscal impact of the undocumented at the three levels of government. The recent executive order signed by President Obama, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), is an amnesty program that has a strong potential to help the U. S. economy retain young and highly educated workers, who have a positive fiscal impact on government finances. This report draws certain recommendations for the design of a successful amnesty and for implementing other immigration reforms from published research...|$|R

Proponents of more restrictive service use policies have argued that lax immigration policies will encourage more <b>undocumented</b> <b>persons</b> to relocate to the United States illegally. They also argue healthcare policies which make insurance, coverage, and treatment more accessible to all populations will encourage undocumented immigrants to overuse services without contributing their fair share to the tax base, ultimately placing an unjust burden on the general public Meanwhile, both taxpayers and politicians point to state welfare and Medicaid programs as specific areas of concern {{when it comes to}} such healthcare use by undocumented populations.|$|R

30|$|Until 1990, the {{migration}} pattern from Mexico to the US {{was typical of}} the historical trend – with 89 % of all Mexican immigrants settling in four states- California, Texas, Illinois and Arizona 4. Over the past two decades, however, Mexican immigrants have displayed unprecedented geographic dispersion 5. Researchers have expounded several theories to describe this phenomenon. Massey (2008) argues that the initial change began with California becoming a less attractive place for Mexicans due to a series of state and federal policy changes including Proposition 187 that barred <b>undocumented</b> <b>persons</b> from utilizing public services, and the tightening of the US–Mexico border that diverted Mexican immigrants from California to other border states. Card and Lewis (2007) found that county-level demand pull factors and city-level supply push factors were significant predictors of Mexican immigrant inflows. Kaushal and Kaestner (2010), on the other hand, found that economic factors were only weakly associated with the geographic dispersion of Mexicans.|$|R
40|$|Objective. This study {{assesses the}} {{association}} between Anglo aversion to Latinos, physical proximity to Latinos, and contact with ethnic minorities, with expressed preferences for immigration policies. Methods. Data were drawn from a telephone survey of San Diego County, California, residents (N 5 549 Anglos) using random-digit-dial procedures during 2005 – 2006 that was conducted by closely supervised professional interviewers. Descriptive reports, tau-b correlations, and multivariate logistic regressions were used for analysis. Results. Aversion to Latinos, as indicated by an adaptation of the Bogardus social distance scale, was related to more restric-tionist attitudes about legal and Mexican immigration. Associations increased when respondents were primed to consider Mexican immigration, although aversion to Latinos {{was not related to}} attitudes about amnesty for <b>undocumented</b> <b>persons.</b> Contrary to some previous findings, proximity to Latino populations increased op-position to legal immigration and amnesty.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, Latinos have been buffeted by two major forces: {{a record number}} of {{immigrant}} deportations and the housing foreclosure crisis. Yet, prior work has not assessed the link between the two. We hypothesize that deportations exacerbate rates of foreclosure among Latinos by removing income earners from owner-occupied households. We employ a quasi-experimental approach that leverages variation in county applications for 287 (g) immigration enforcement agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and data on foreclosure filings from 2005 – 2012. These models uncover a substantial association of enforcement with Hispanic foreclosure rates. The association is stronger in counties with more immigrant detentions and a larger share of <b>undocumented</b> <b>persons</b> in owner-occupied homes.

These divisions are articulated around different conceptions of what the struggle's aims should be (a fight against liberalism or an alternative experiment) and differences regarding the sense of belonging to the global space of protest (transnational networks or national territory). The history of convergence placed the have-nots at the heart of alter-globalist mobilizations, whereas the history of divergence translated into a ‘decentering’ of the place of the have-nots within this space.
