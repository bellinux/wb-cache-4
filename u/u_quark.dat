40|$|The decays of B mesons {{to a pair}} of charmless pseudoscalar (P) mesons are {{analyzed}} within a framework of flavor SU(3). Symmetry breaking is taken into account in tree (T) amplitudes through ratios of decay constants; exact SU(3) is assumed elsewhere. Acceptable fits to B →ππ and B → K π branching ratios and CP asymmetries are obtained with tree, color-suppressed (C), penguin (P), and electroweak penguin (P_EW) amplitudes. Crucial additional terms for describing processes involving η and η' include a large flavor-singlet penguin amplitude (S) as proposed earlier and a penguin amplitude P_tu associated with intermediate t and <b>u</b> <b>quarks.</b> For the B^+ →π^+ η' mode a term S_tu associated with intermediate t and <b>u</b> <b>quarks</b> also may be needed.

40|$|Some Beyond the Standard Models {{suggested}} that fermions might have composite substructure. The existence of excited quarks {{is going to}} be the strong proof for the compositeness of Standard Model fermions. Therefore, the excited quarks have been investigated by the phenomenological and the experimental high energy physicists at various collider options for more than 40 years. The Future Circular Collider (FCC) is newly planned particle accelerator to be established at CERN. Beside the √(s) = 100 TeV proton-proton collisions, FCC includes electron-positron and electron-proton collision options. Construction of linear e^- e^+ colliders (or dedicated e-linac) tangential to the FCC will give opportunity to handle multi-TeV ep and γ p collisions.
