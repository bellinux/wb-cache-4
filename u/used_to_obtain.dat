5|$|Dilation and {{curettage}} or an {{endometrial biopsy}} are <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> a tissue sample for histological examination. Endometrial biopsy is the less invasive option, {{but it may}} not give conclusive results every time. Hysteroscopy only shows the gross anatomy of the endometrium, which is often not indicative of cancer, and is therefore not used, unless in conjunction with a biopsy. Hysteroscopy can be used to confirm a diagnosis of cancer. New evidence shows that D has a higher false negative rate than endometrial biopsy.|$|E

5|$|Observational {{astronomy}} uses lensing {{effects as}} an important tool to infer properties of the lensing object. Even in cases where that object is not directly visible, {{the shape of a}} lensed image provides information about the mass distribution responsible for the light deflection. In particular, gravitational lensing provides one way to measure the distribution of dark matter, which does not give off light and can be observed only by its gravitational effects. One particularly interesting application are large-scale observations, where the lensing masses are spread out over a significant fraction of the observable universe, and can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> information about the large-scale properties and evolution of our cosmos.|$|E
