40|$|How can we {{grow the}} {{practice}} of philanthropy for social justice and peace? This is the question we put to twenty-four leading practitioners {{from different parts of}} the world during interviews conducted between May and December of 2012. In the pages that follow, you'll hear a fascinating and at times provocative array of answers, reflections, and further questions. Some talk about the relationship between social justice and economic development. Others call for a greater emphasis on indigenous philanthropy. Some speak to what is common among practitioners of social justice philanthropy, while others discuss geographic differences. Risk emerges as a key obstacle, networking as a key opportunity. We did these interviews [...] along with a survey of 68 practitioners [...] as part of our work to spark conversation and connection among philanthropy practitioners committed to advancing social justice and peace in regions around the globe. The Philanthropy for Social Justice and Peace Network exists to increase the impact of this kind of grant making. We do this by developing tools and practices, shifting the narrative in philanthropy, and supporting a community of practice. We invite you to join the Network and the conversation.

40|$|As {{often with}} fisheries-related matters, the {{contents}} of this newsletter may provoke mixed reactions. Apprehension, with Anouk Ride’s or Giff Johnson’s articles (p. 24 & 25), indicating that despite clear warning signals sent by scientists, decisions {{still need to be}} made on critical issues such as the overfishing of bigeye and yellowfin tuna; fear, with the very moving letter sent by a Pacific Island crew member working aboard a foreign fishing vessel (p. 27); or hope, with some good news from the aquaculture sector — villagers who are harvesting their first milkfish crop in Fiji (p. 20); a successful aquaculture meeting in Tahiti (p. 15); and slightly clearer skies for the prawn farming industry in New Caledonia (p. 19). As usual, this issue also includes feature articles specifically written for this newsletter. Bob Gillett reports on a short survey he made of fisheries centres in the Pacific region (p. 29). He gives a list of lessons learned from past experiences that should be used when planning new fisheries centre installations. Emilie Fernandez and Valérie Allain write about their study of reef prey in tuna diets (p. 35). Surprisingly, reef prey represents almost 17 % of tuna diets on average, and can be as much as 60 % in certain areas. Finally, Éric Clua weighs the benefits and setbacks of shark feeding in the ecotourism industry (p. 40). On Moorea, French Polynesia, it was calculated that one lemon shark contributed USD 2. 3 million in revenue to the island over its 20 -year lifespan. This is certainly a strong incentive for the development of this type of activity, but, as Clua shows, there are risks associated for local shark populations. A fine balance must be found.

40|$|You {{were promised}} three {{issues of the}} Journal this year. This issue completes the promise, even though late. We hope you will read it and let <b>us</b> know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of the {{articles}} it contains. Frankly, we are still groping and searching {{for a way to}} implement the editorial policy of the Association, which is, we feel, very clearly and simply stated: 1. AMCAP will seek to publish articles that are distinctively concerned with or related to LDS Counselors and Psychotherapists that:-are authored with members of the Church and not apt to be published elsewhere. -have been published elsewhere but are such distinctive quality and importance as to warrant republication by AMCAP. 2. AMCAP will not publish material which, in the opinion of the editorial board, might be construed as questioning, taking issue with or contradicting established doctrine of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There are those who would perform a more "liberal" policy ta be sure- one that would allow for open dialogue about "controversial " issues. But the Govern-ing Board has wisely, we feel, adopted this policy for the sake of allowing us to share our concerns, experiences, findings, insights, etc. while avoiding the problems that inevitably arrives when dissident, self-seeking voices are given free access to the pages of such a significant publication as ours. The challenge for us is to use the Journal in a positive and constructive way by publishing articles that are helpful, inspiring, thought-provoking, informative, ap-plicable, mind-stretching and interesting- but not critical, contradictory or inimical of the professions of which we are a part. Are we succeeding, to a degree at least? Do these articles and those published in previous issues meet these criteria? If you feel that they do, please let us hear from you. If not, send us some that do. Our plan for 1979 - 80 is to publish the Journal quarterly. We hope to have an issue in the mail by th...|$|R
