Although it {{represents}} a source of renewable energy, each proposal tends to come under local opposition because of its likely impact on coastal habitats. One proposal, which came to fruition in 1966, is the Rance barrage which generates 250MW. Unlike historical tide mills which could only operate on an , the Rance barrage can generate electricity on both flows of the tide {{or it can be}} <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> depending on demand.

5000|$|The Panjiakou Dam is a 107.5 m {{tall and}} 1040 m {{concrete}} gravity dam. The dam's reservoir has {{a capacity of}} [...] and surface area of 67 km2. Of the reservoir's capacity, [...] is active (or [...] "useful") for power generation and water supply. The dam sits {{of the head of}} a 33700 km2 catchment area which constitutes 75 percent of the Luan River basin. The dam's spillway is located on its left face and contains 18 floodgates. It has a maximum discharge capacity of [...] To the right of the spillway is the power house which contains one 150 MW Francis turbine generator and three 90 MW reversible Francis turbine pump generators. Located 5.5 km downstream is the lower reservoir dam. It is a gravity type and has a height of 28 m and length of 1010 m. It creates the lower reservoir with a storage capacity of [...] of which [...] can be <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> power generation. When the pumped storage capability is used, the Panjiakou Reservoir serves as the upper reservoir and water is released down to the three pump generators for power production. It is subsequently discharged into the lower reservoir. This occurs during periods of high peak power demand. When power demand is low, usually at night when electricity is cheaper, the turbines of the pump generators reverse and pump water back into the upper reservoir. This process repeats as needed. A small power plant on the lower reservoir dam contains two 5 MW Kaplan turbine bulb-generators.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{important}} <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> {{has traditionally been}} to balance baseload powerplants, but may {{also be used to}} abate the fluctuating output of intermittent energy sources. <b>Pumped</b> <b>storage</b> provides a load at times of high electricity output and low electricity demand, enabling additional system peak capacity. In certain jurisdictions, electricity prices may be close to zero or occasionally negative on occasions that there is more electrical generation available than there is load available to absorb it; although at present this is rarely due to wind or solar power alone, increased wind and solar generation will increase the likelihood of such occurrences. It is particularly likely that <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> will become especially important as a balance for very large scale photovoltaic generation. Increased long distance transmission capacity combined with significant amounts of energy storage will be a crucial part of regulating any large-scale deployment of intermittent renewable power sources. [...] The high non-firm renewable electricity penetration in some regions [...] supplies 40% of annual output, but 60% may be reached before additional storage is necessary.|$|R
