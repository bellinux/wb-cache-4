40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} physical models specifically to predict the behaviour of strata and artificial supports {{in the vicinity of}} underground mining openings. The application of the technique was initially designed for coal mining but was extended to include metalliferous mining structures. The factors which caused the observable effects underground were either unknown or improperly understood. Physical models were considered, and later proved, to be capable of displaying the breaking behaviour of the strata, leading to methods to control it or avoid problems so that mining could take place efficiently, safely and economically. At the time of commencement of this research there was little prior information to establish and extend modelling techniques. Therefore it became necessary for the author to envisage all possible applications and to design test rigs, hydraulics for load application and modelling methods thus providing the greatest flexibility in operation. The thesis includes sections dealing with modelling theory, design philosophy, modelling techniques and the acquisition of data such as rock properties and strata stresses from bore cores or in the mine, together with an extensive testing programme for the development of model materials to simulate mine rocks. Examples by way of case studies and the conclusions derived are given. There are various types of models of which true models were considered the only satisfactory category for the purposes envisaged. Rig design was influenced by the strengths of the mine rocks, selection of model materials, geometric and strength scale factors. Maximum rig loads were affected by space limitations and design criteria, dictated by the appropriate structural design codes. Following the construction of test rigs and some models it was found that there were factors which were not common to model and prototype. Limited physical dimensions of models, geometric scale, opening dimensions compared with platen sizes, friction between models and their test rigs, platens and other surfaces became vital and significant problems which had to be overcome before accurate predictions became possible. These deficiencies or apparent departure from true modelling conditions first required recognition of their existence followed by methods to ameliorate or avoid certain problems. Despite considerable devotion to the problem of friction there always remained problems relating to overstressing or <b>understressing</b> a model. Therefore, the problem of friction has been given detailed attention in the thesis but in each case, new developments have been discussed together with their various ramifications. Model materials were found to be highly abrasive and even took their toll on tungsten carbide tipped tools. Dissection of complex models after completion of testing was achieved using large crosscut saws with water flushing. Mining of models required innovative methods. Electric detonators were used to progressively mine coal or metalliferous pillars while the model was under load. Contrary to popular opinion, testing of specially constructed sections determined that numerous detonators were required to be fired simultaneously for the desired results and without damage {{to other parts of the}} model. Flexible, fibre-optic devices were used through tubing built into the model during construction to observe progressive failure. Strain gauges, adhered to surfaces of openings, recorded changes as various portions fractured or failed. Simple masonry tools and steel tubing with flared, segmented ends were ideal for extracting model coal seams. Pneumatic tools were also used. In order to evaluate the accuracy of prediction, models of known situations were constructed and tested. Later, models which had been constructed, tested and results reported were found to have predicted the behaviour of the prototype with acceptably good accuracy. For example, in the prediction of longwall caving, model tests were better than 90 % of actual prototype results in features such as caving span and support pressures. Other conclusions derived from model tests showed that pillars greater than a certain size had no deleterious effects upon roadways. Results of this nature were subsequently confirmed by mathematical modelling, specifically finite element analysis and it is an important fact that the results from physical models which predicted the behaviour of underground structures were able to correct and refine computer programmes. Physical models, acting in an intermediate role enabled precise refinements since all the necessary properties (input data) such as external stresses, material strengths, geometric details and resultant closures or deformations were available. Many of these properties were, and still are unable to be derived from the mine. Physical models not only display a realistic appearance of the structure being simulated but have been shown to accurately predict the behaviour of the prototype...|$|E

In the region of low <b>understress,</b> the acceleration in moist air was appreciably less than that in dry air and nitrogen due to oxide-induced crack closure. The acceleration in vacuum was smaller than that in other environments over all <b>understress</b> levels, possibly because of reweiding.

40|$|Today space trusses are {{designed}} using linear elastic theory, and the {{load carrying capacity}} of the truss {{is considered to be}} limited by the failure of a new critical members. Because of high redundancy, and due to practical constraints in selecting member sizes, only a portion of the member strength is used. Attempts have been made to utilize the remaining strength of the members by providing a means of transferring load from critical compression members to the <b>understressed</b> members. However because of the brittle buckling characteristics of compression elements, when they fall in the economic range of slenderness, postbuckling reserve capacity of compression members cannot be developed. Load transfer must thus be made before compression members reach their capacity. One part of this study is concerned with the modification of space truss behaviour by introducing nonlinearity in the chord members prior to attaining their maximum load. The amount of nonlinearity required to increase the load capacity of the truss by an economically justifiable amount has been studied, and the feasibility of the proposed system was confirmed by tests on the elements and on an assembled full scale truss. As an alternative, transfer of load from critical chord elements to the <b>understressed</b> chord elements can be achieved by the selective removal of internal bracing members. A means to determine the optimum selection of diagonals to be removed has been established. The above techniques were applied to four space trusses which were similar in size and proportions, but which varied in their support conditions and the distribution of member sizes. It was further considered whether the combination of the two techniques, of nonlinear chord behaviour and diagonal removal, could further improve the capacity, or whether each, when optimum, leads to the same load carrying capacity...|$|R

To quantita-tively evaluate some of these effects, we examine a model of dynamic rupture on a frictional fault embedded in an elastic full space, governed by plane strain elasticity, {{with a pair of}} off-fault inclusions that have a lower rigidity than the background medium. We solve the elas-todynamic problem using the Finite Element software Pylith. The fault operates under linear slip-weakening friction law. We initiate the rupture by artificially overstressing a localized region near the left edge of the fault. We primarily consider embedded soft inclusions with 20 per cent reduction in both the pressure wave and shear wave speeds. The embedded inclusions are placed at different distances from the fault surface and have different sizes. We show that the existence of a soft inclusion may significantly shorten the transition length to supers-hear propagation through the Burridge-Andrews mechanism. We also observe that supershear rupture is generated at pre-stress values that are lower than what is theoretically predicted for a homogeneous medium. We discuss the implications of our results for dynamic rupture propagation in complex velocity structures as well as supershear propagation on <b>understressed</b> faults...|$|R

40|$|By {{signing the}} Valletta Treaty, several {{countries}} have obliged themselves to save archaeological heritage sites and fund relevant research. <b>UNDERSTRESS</b> is {{a proposal for}} funding which does research and provides data to predict damage done to such archaeological site by construction of linear infrastructure. As a preliminary study this BSc thesis is {{carried out in the}} framework of <b>UNDERSTRESS.</b> Although research has been done on archaeological artefacts embedded in sand, charred organic seeds have not been investigated thoroughly yet. The sand, which comes from a depot near Dronten in the Netherlands, has been used because multiple archaeological artefacts have been found in that sand layer. As analogue for the charred organic seeds coco pops, the cereal, have been used. The characteristics of the sand {{as well as of the}} coco pops have been investigated. A falling height of fifty centimetres has proven to create a reproducible density. To test the damage to the coco pops samples have been triaxial tested with a vacuum pressure applied of 80 kPA. This vacuum pressure create an effective confining pressure of 80 kPA as well. With the falling height and the confining pressure, a sample configuration in which two layers of coco pops are placed, the damage to those coco pops is zero when applied to a strain of five millimetres. The damage is made visible by using 3 D visualising software called Avizo. The grain have not been damage during that test and they have not reallocated as well. For another configuration the coco pops did not react the same. The entire sample was filled with coco pops and sand as supporting material and this time the strain was 15 millimetres. Three scans made at three different times during the loading show that the coco pops are not damaged until after the sample has reached its maximum stress. All the damage to the coco pops as well as the reallocation of the coco pops happens between the peak stress and the unloading. At the slice where the radial deformation of the sample is the largest are all coco pops are damaged with most of them crushed. Two centimetres above and below this slice, the coco pops are partially damage and further away from this slice, the coco pops are not damaged. In total, 10 percent is damaged during the loading. The coco pops are damaged so severely, not much information they have stored would be available if it were charred organic seeds. The charred organic seeds do have twice the strength of a coco pop according to earlier research. Geo-EngineeringGeoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} there are three types of shape of {{acoustic}} body waves propagating inside competent and homogeneous formations penetrated by a borehole : simple, double, and resonant. This fact is connected to the modifications undergone by the area located around a well after drilling in relation to in situ state of stress. There are overstressed and <b>understressed</b> vertical cylindrical zones with "bubble-shaped" cross-sections, in which acoustic body waves are supposed to reflect. The horizontal size and the shape of the stress modified areas depend on the values of (K 1 +K 2) / 2 - with K 1 =SH/Sv (the overburden pressure) and K 2 =Sh/Sv -, that is to say on the in situ horizontal stress and the anisotropy of this stress. The calculation of the velocities of the P and S double waves allows us to evaluate the radial thicknesses of these stress modified areas. As their values are different according to whether they result from P or S waves, we propose an explanation based on their wavelengths. The comparisons with other works on the in situ stress of the studied boreholes allow us to propose a method for evaluating the horizontal stress and its anisotropy, thanks to the estimation of the value (K 1 +K 2) / 2...|$|R
40|$|Recent phenomenologically {{influenced}} sociology addresses, in part, {{the role}} of language in human activity and {{calls into question the}} capacity of language to fully objectify social processes. In this retrospective light the relation of language and experience presented in George Herbert Mead's Mind, Self and Society becomes increasingly problematic. In addition Mead's reference to meaning as an objective phenomenon and his conception of the "generalized other " bear re-examination. This paper has a rather limited and circumscribed goal-to render explicit Mead's treatment of language and meaning in Mind, Self and Society and to briefly discuss some of the difficulties inherent in this aspect of his work. Of particular concern is the possibility that Mead may have <b>understressed</b> the precategorical dimension 1 of human behavior and, consequently, despite some reference to unconsciously generated actions of human beings, placed a perhaps excessive emphasis upon rational and conscious activity. This discussion, however, does not take place in a vacuum apart from recent sociological concerns. Currently, for instance, ethnomethodology has explicitly focused on the taken-for-granted "background expectancies " or "interpretive procedures " which underlie and make possible a sense of social order.

40|$|Immersed tunnels are {{particularly}} sensitive to tensile and compressive deformations {{such as those}} imposed by a normal seismogenic fault rupturing underneath, and those generated by the dynamic response due to seismic waves. The paper investigates the response of a future 70 m deep immersed tunnel to the consecutive action of a major normal fault rupturing in an earthquake occurring in the basement rock underneath the tunnel, and a subsequent strong excitation from a different large-magnitude seismic event that may occur years later. Non-linear finite elements model the quasi-static fault rupture propagation through the thick soil deposit overlying the bedrock and the ensuing interaction of the rupture with the immersed tunnel. It is shown that despite imposed bedrock offset of 2 m, net tension or excessive compression between tunnel segments could be avoided with a suitable design of the joint gaskets. Then, the already deformed (""injured"") structure is subjected to strong asynchronous seismic shaking. The thick-walled tunnel is modelled as a 3 -D massive flexural beam connected to the soil through properly-calibrated nonlinear interaction springs and dashpots, the supports of which are subjected to the free-field acceleration time histories. The latter, obtained with 1 -D wave propagation analysis, are then modified to account for wave passage effects. The joints between tunnel segments are modeled with special non-linear hyper-elastic elements, properly accounting for their 7 -bar longitudinal hydrostatic pre-stressing. Sliding is captured with special gap elements. The effect of segment length and joint properties is explored parametrically. A fascinating conclusion emerges in all analysed cases for the joints between segments that were differentially deformed after the quasi-static fault rupture: upon subsequent very strong seismic shaking, overstressed joints de-compress and <b>understressed</b> joints re-compress-a ""healing"" process {{that leads to a}} more uniform deformation profile along the tunnel. This is particularly beneficial for the precariously de-compressed joint gaskets.

40|$|Hip {{resurfacing}} arthroplasty (HRA) {{is proposed}} {{as an alternative}} to total hip arthroplasty for patients suffering from osteoarthritis or degenerative arthrosis. HRA consist in removing the articular surface of the femoral head and replacing it with a spherical metallic implant that has a thin straight stem used as an alignment aid during implantation. HRA cannot be offered to all patients due to surgical contraindications related to bone quality in the femoral head. To overcome some of those problems, it has been suggested in the literature to cement the alignment stem of the femoral component. However, this could generate stress shielding (<b>understressed</b> bone tends to resorb, thus destabilizing the implant and causing aseptic loosening) in the femoral head, which could compromise the implant long term stability. The use of a biomimetic composite material with bone-matching properties could be a means of using the stem to optimize load transfer to the femoral bone. This optimisation would aim at minimizing stress shielding in the femoral head for an implant with a fixed stem, benefiting from the same stability as cemented stem implants without the increased stress shielding. The current thesis objective was to evaluate this solution by developing a finite element model of a hip resurfacing femoral component with a stem made of biomimetic composite material, and to evaluate its potential in terms of stress shielding reduction and biomechanical performance. Numerical results from a first study showed reduction of stress shielding for the implant with a fixed biomimetic stem when compared with a cemented metallic stem, but the biomimetic stem was still stress shielded when compared with an unfixed metallic stem or healthy femur. A second study examined modeling methods for bone-cement and bone-implant load-bearing interfaces for different fixation scenarios. It showed that traditional methods (bonded /frictional contact elements) created under certain circumstances unrealistic results such as complete absence of micromotions at bone-stem interface. A new interface element was developed to address some of the limitations observed on traditional interface modeling methods. This new interface element aimed at simulating the progressive degradation of bone-cement interfaces and osseointegration of bone-implant interfaces. Numerical results obtained with the biomimetic implant using the new element showed a partial osseointegration pattern on the stem surface, with the presence of “spot-welds” (localised points of perfect osseointegration). The new implant with its biomimetic stem allows reduction of stress shielding when compared with current metallic implants. Recommendations following this thesis include optimisation of the geometrical shape of the biomimetic stem, in order to further improve load transfer to the femoral proximal bone...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{ideal of}} the modern public education is to provide every human being with the equal opportunity and to cultivate his abilities as far as possible, without regard to his status, class, race, and sex. But it is a formal conception in itself. We must understand that the education is largely conditioned by the social and historical situations, and has a certain social function, facing on the problems and crisis of the society. “An educational system {{does not exist in}} a vacuum. It exists always within a social system which makes its own nature and purpose the frame work within which the nature and purpose of its educational idea must function. ” The public school system of America is in part a product of the democratic spirit of the American people, but in part a product of the industrial capitalism rapidly be coming dominant. It rendered assistance to industrial and financial capitalism and helped to promote the spirit of business enterprise. It was motivated by zeal for maintaining the political and social status quo. Laski says, “A capitalist democracy has never been able to overcome, in its educational programme, the initial paradox that the drive of capitalist aims is in inherent contradiction with the drive of democratic aims. ” The public education in the South of America is very poor and backward. No Southern state had enacted a compulsory-attendance law before 1900; less than 60 percent of the school population of the South was enrolled in school; and less than 40 percent was in average daily attendance. Considerably, more than one fourth of the white population, and about 70 percent of the colored population, was illiterate. This fact has a vital meaning. In the South the presence of the institution of slavery tended to retard the growth of an educational consiousness, and sectional struggles prevented the organization of schools. The institution of slavery was the fundamental basis of the plantation system. By a plantation is ment “a large agricultural unit in which the laboring force,generally of a large size and in boundage, worked under supervision in the production of a staple commodity for sale. ” A few planters had the privileges in every social and political affair. They exploited ruthlessly the slaves and poor whites, and put a heavy pressure upon them in order to keep them in their desperate conditions. In these situations, democracy and freedom of thought was <b>understressed,</b> therefore public school system had never developed. By the Civil War, the slaves were emancipated from slavery and given civil right as citizens and voters. But the main purpose of the Republican Party was not the extirpation of slavery, but permanent victory of the Republicanism, therefore of the industrial capitalism in the South. Emancipation was only a instrument, as far as the Negroes were concerned. When the Reconstruction was over, the Negroes were again bound to labor under the plantation system as the semi-slavery system and exploited as much as before. During the Reconstruction, basing upon the principle of the public, free, and universal education for all, many Southern States provided for the new school laws and improved the conditions of education. Many of the laws were helpless, however, owing to the poverty, the uncertain political conditions, the mixed-shool conception of public education, and ignorance of the people. The ruling class of the Old South disliked and feared to educate the Negroes as citizens, because it needed the cheap and docile labors...|$|R
