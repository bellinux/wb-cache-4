"I believe," [...] Burnamy broke out, with a {{bitterness}} apparently {{relevant to}} the ruin alone, [...] "that if you hadn't required any quarterings of nobility from him, Stoller {{would have made a}} good sort of robber baron. He's a robber baron by nature, now, and he wouldn't have any scruple in levying tribute on <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> one-spanner, if his castle was in good repair and his crossbowmen were not on a strike. But they would be on a strike, probably, and then he would lock them out, and employ none but non-union crossbowmen." ...|$|E

What was going on with this bit? Had Renwick written it with his feet, in the bath or something? Then gone through it removing all traces of point or humour, then dropped it actually into the bath, then torn it up, then asked for it to be quickly rewritten by, say, an ant? Euan Ferguson ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{have spoken}} to you of the causes which {{in the past have}} led up to this Budget. I {{have spoken to}} you of its present justification. What of the future? If I had to sum up the {{immediate}} future of democratic politics in a single word I should say [...] "Insurance." [...] That is the future--Insurance against dangers from abroad. Insurance against dangers scarcely less grave and much more near and constant which threaten <b>us</b> <b>here</b> at home <b>in</b> <b>our</b> own island. I had the honour and opportunity a few days ago of explaining to the House of Commons our proposals for unemployment insurance. That is a considerable matter. It stands by itself. It is a much simpler question than invalidity insurance; but it is a great matter by itself. Indeed, I thought while I was explaining it to the House of Commons that I had not made such an important speech since I had the honour of explaining the details of the Transvaal Constitution.|$|R

60|$|I must say, however, {{that the}} reason why this decree, or order, {{whichever}} it may be called, has been made, was to the end that men and women, who had large families of children, might be induced to join <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> Jamestown, {{as if we had}} not already mouths enough to feed.|$|R
