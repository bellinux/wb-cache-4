Vegetative treatment systems (VTSs) provide a cost-effective option that may enhance environmental security by protecting water quality. Vegetative treatment systems are typically designed {{on the basis of}} hydraulic performance, which may result in excess application of some nutrients, specifically nitrogen and phosphorus. Groundwater quality monitoring is required to determine the effect, if any, that VTSs have on groundwater. Shallow groundwater (2 to 10 m) quality beneath six VTSs in Iowa was monitored over a four-year period. Monitoring wells were located <b>upgradient,</b> within, and downgradient of the VTSs. Groundwater samples were collected on a monthly basis and analyzed for ammoniacal nitrogen, chloride, nitrate-nitrogen, and fecal coliforms.

40|$|Core {{samples taken}} from a zero-valent iron {{permeable}} reactive barrier (ZVI PRB) at Cornhusker Army Ammunition Plant, Nebraska, were analyzed for physical and chemical characteristics. Precipitates containing iron and sulfide were pres-ent at much higher concentrations in native aquifer materials just <b>upgradient</b> of the PRB than in the PRB itself. Sulfur mass balance on core solids coupled with trends in ground water sulfate concentrations indicates that the average ground water flow after 20 months of PRB operation was approximately twenty fold less than the regional ground water velocity. Trans-port and reaction modeling of the aquifer PRB interface suggests that, at the calculated velocity, both iron and hydrogen could diffuse <b>upgradient</b> against ground water flow and thereby contribute to precipitation in the native aquifer materials. The initial hydraulic conductivity (K) of the native materials is {{less than that of}} the PRB and, given the observed pre-cipitation in the <b>upgradient</b> native materials, it is likely that K reduction occurred <b>upgradient</b> to rather than within the PRB.

40|$|In {{regions of}} sloping isopycnals, isopycnal mixing acting in {{conjunction}} with biological cycling can produce patterns in the nutrient ®eld which have negative values of tracer in light water and unrealistically large values of tracer in dense water. Under certain circumstances, these patterns can start to grow unstably. This paper discusses why such behavior occurs. Using a simple four-box model, it demonstrates that the instability appears when the isopycnal slopes exceed the grid aspect ratio (Dz=Dx). In contrast to other well known instabilities of the CFL type, this instability {{does not depend on}} the time step or time-stepping scheme. Instead it arises from a fundamental incompatibility between two requirements for isopycnal mixing schemes, namely that they should produce no net ¯ux of passive tracer across an isopycnal and everywhere reduce tracer extrema. In order to guarantee no net ¯ux of tracer across an isopycnal, some <b>upgradient</b> ¯uxes across certain parts of an isopycnal are required to balance downgradient ¯uxes across other parts of the isopycnal. However, these <b>upgradient</b> ¯uxes can cause local maxima in the nutrient ®eld to become self-reinforcing. Although this is less of a problem in larger domains, there is still a strong tendency for isopycnal mixing to overconcentrate tracer in the dense water. The introduction of eddy-induced advection is shown to be capable of counteracting the <b>upgradient</b> ¯uxes of nutrient which cause problems, stabilizing the solution. The issue is not simply a numerical curiosity. When used in a GCM, di€erent parameterizations of eddy mixing result in noticeably di€erent distributions of nutrient and large di€erences in biological production. While much of this is attributable to di€erences in convection and circulation, the numerical errors described here may also {{play an important role in}} runs with isopycna...|$|E

The isotope signature of all the components potentially involved in the degradation processes has been expressed using the concentration-weighted average 13 C of CBs + benzene (13 Csum). <b>Upgradient</b> of the HB, the average 13 Csum of 25. 6 ‰and 29. 4 ‰were measured for plumes within the eastern and western sectors, respectively. Similar values were observed for the potential sources, with 13 Csum values of 26. 5 ‰for contaminated soils and 29. 8 ‰for the processing water pipeline in the eastern and western sectors, respectively, allowing for apportioning of these potential sources to the respective contaminant plumes. For the downgradient of the HB, similar CB concentrations but enriched 13 Csum values between 24. 5 ‰and 25. 9 ‰were measured. Moreover, contaminated soils showed a similar 13 Csum signature of 24. 5 ‰, thus suggesting that the plumes likely originate from past activities located in the downgradient of the HB. Within the industrial property, significant 13 C enrichments were measured for 1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzene (TCB), 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene (DCB), 1, 3 -DCB, and 1, 4 -DCBs, thus suggesting an important role for anaerobic biodegradation.

40|$|The {{role of the}} {{relative}} geometry of mechanical forcing (wind stress) and buoyancy forcing (prescribed surface temperature) in {{the maintenance of the}} main thermocline is explored. In particular, the role of the wind stress curl in enhancing or suppressing the generation of baroclinic eddies is studied in simplified domains. The dependence of key quantities, such as the depth of the thermocline and the maximum heat transport, on the external parameters such as diapycnal mixing and dissipation rate is examined. Qualitatively different regimes are found depending on {{the relative}} phase of the wind stress and surface buoyancy distribution. The most efficient arrangement for eddy generation has Ekman pumping (suction) in conjunction with high (low) surface buoyancy. This corresponds to the situation found in the midlatitudes, where the surface Ekman flow carries heat toward the warmer region (i. e., <b>upgradient</b> of the surface temperature). In this case, strong eddy fluxes are generated in order to counteract the <b>upgradient</b> heat transport by the Ekman cell. The result is a thermocline whose depth is independent of the diapycnal diffusivity. However, the competition between these opposing heat fluxes leads to a weak net heat transport, proportional to the diffusivity responsible for the diabatic forcing.

Analyses of water samples from monitoring wells hydraulically up gradient and down gradient of the landfill showed downgradient groundwater is being impacted by the landfill. Comparison of the analyses from <b>upgradient</b> and downgradient monitoring wells during an October 2004 sampling event showed the following maximum contaminant concentration increases in downgradient monitoring wells: aluminum 460 %, barium 400 %, iron 400 %, lead 320 %, manganese 2, 300 %, chloride 2, 400 %, sulfate 1, 700 %, total dissolved solids 570 %, and total phenols were not detectable in the <b>upgradient</b> monitoring well and were in excess of the New Mexico Environment Department drinking water standards in a downgradient monitoring well.

Resource agency {{concerns}} over the dredging practices in the Savannah Harbor prompted the USACE Savannah District (CESAS) to commission a comprehensive study to evaluate environmental effects. CESAS is currently citing findings and recommendations in the final report in their permitting effort for existing and future maintenance dredging activities that involve agitation dredging and open water disposal. The comprehensive Scope of Work (SOW) developed was a collaborative effort between CESAS, reviewing agencies, and Applied Technology and Management (ATM) technical staff. The data collection study design required three distinct simultaneous efforts: water chemistry sampling, in situ water quality profiling, and monitoring the dredged material discharge plume. This last effort utilized acoustic doppler technology. SEDIVIEW, an acoustic doppler post-processing software package, was employed to quantify total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations from the acoustic backscatter signal. Total recoverable chemistry (TRC) samples were collected both <b>upgradient</b> and downgradient of the dredged material discharge to quantify the concentrations of selected constituents released to the water column {{as a result of}} the dredging activity. In situ profiles were also performed <b>upgradient</b> and downgradient to measure changes to water quality (especially, dissolved oxygen) resulting from thedredging activity. All data were analyzed and presented in the final report. Effects to aquatic resources resulting from changes to suspended sediment concentrations, water chemistry, and water quality were also evaluated. The fate of the suspended material was also modeled using SSFATE, a program developed for the USACE by Applied Science Associates, Inc...|$|E

No constituents exceeded final PDWS in {{samples from the}} <b>upgradient</b> monitoring wells. As in previous quarters, tritium and trichloroethylene were the most widespread elevated constituents. Chloroethene, gross alpha, lead, mercury, and tetrachloroethylene also exceeded final PDWS {{in one or more}} wells. Elevated constituents were found in numerous Aquifer Zone IIB{sub 2 } (Water Table) and Aquifer Zone IIB{sub 1 } (Barnwell/McBean) wells and in three Aquifer Unit IIA (Congaree) wells. The groundwater flow directions and rates in the three hydrostratigraphic units were similar to those of previous quarters...|$|E
