40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{clarify the}} {{characteristics}} of twistable pedunculated subserosal uterine leiomyomas. MethodsA retrospective study was conducted of female subserosal uterine leiomyoma patients who were treated by laparoscopic myomectomy at Showa University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan, between January 2011 and September 2015. The patients were classified according to their intraoperative findings. The maximum diameter and volume of the subserosal uterine leiomyoma, and the length and thickness of the peduncle were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging, and torsion and nontorsion cases were compared. ResultsA total of eight torsion cases and 20 nontorsion cases were analyzed. The average peduncle length was significantly higher in the torsion cases (18. 7 ± 3. 5  mm) than in the nontorsion cases (9. 0 ± 3. 9  mm). The maximum diameter and volume of subserosal uterine leiomyoma and {{the thickness of the}} peduncle did not differ between the groups. The length to thickness ratio (length to thickness index) was more clearly associated with the torsion than the length of the peduncle or the ratio of the maximum diameter of the leiomyoma to the length. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that a length to thickness ratio of > 1. 0 was associated with a higher detection rate, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0. 95 (95 % confidence interval 0. 86 – 1. 00, p< 0. 001). ConclusionsIn the preoperative period, the length of the peduncle was associated with the subsequent occurrence of torsion in patients with subserosal uterine leiomyoma.

40|$|Background: Of all Smooth muscle tumours {{originating}} from <b>uterus</b> are <b>leiomyomas</b> {{are the most}} common ones. Benign nature and smooth muscle origination of leiomyomas can be easily documented via histological examination. In present study it was tried to examine immunohistochemical profile of leiomyomas with different subtypes. Material and Methods: In this cross-sectional study 64 cases of smooth muscle tumors {{originating from}} uterus were included in study. As a control group 12 cases of conventional leiomyomas were selected. Then estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, p 53 and ki- 67 were assessed. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 16. 0. Results: P 53 and ki- 67 antibody status was diffusely positive in 12 out of 24 cases (50 %) of leiomyosarcomas. Leiomyomas with bizzare nuclei were stained with Ki 67 proliferative marker less than those in obviously malignant cases (P < 0. 001). Estrogen and progesterone receptors had a reverse correlation with tumours malignancy potential. Conclusion: Since p 53 is known as an important inhibitory trigger for proliferative cycle of cells, in current study it was concluded that p 53 inhibitory role decreases as malignancy potential increases, also tumors dependence on steroids via steroid receptors decreases as malignancy potential increases...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Minimally {{invasive}} {{methods are}} used as alternatives to treat leiomyomas and include uterine artery embolization, which {{has emerged as a}} safe, effective method. This study aims to evaluate the magnetic resonance imaging predictors for a reduction in leiomyoma volume in patients undergoing uterine artery embolization. METHODS: This prospective longitudinal study was performed at a university hospital. We followed 50 symptomatic premenopausal women with uterine leiomyomas who underwent uterine artery embolization. We examined 179 leiomyomas among these patients. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed one month before and six months after uterine artery embolization. Two radiologists who specialized in abdominal imaging independently interpreted the images. Main Outcome Measures: The magnetic resonance imaging parameters were the <b>uterus</b> and <b>leiomyomas</b> volumes, their localizations, contrast perfusion pattern and node-to-muscle ratio. RESULTS: Six months after treatment, the average uterine volume reduction was 38. 91 %, and the leiomyomas were reduced by 55. 23 %. When the leiomyomas were submucosal and/or had a higher node-to-muscle ratio in the T 2 images, the volume reduction was even greater (greater than 50 %). Other parameters showed no association. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that symptomatic uterine leiomyomas in patients undergoing uterine artery embolization exhibit volume reductions greater than 50 % by magnetic resonance imaging when the leiomyomas are submucosal and/or had a high node-to-muscle ratio in the T 2 images...|$|R

Frequency of uterine leiomyoma is up to 60 % in the overall structure of gynecological diseases. Objective: to assess the state of regional hemodynamics in women with uterine leiomyoma. Materials and methods. Regional hemodynamics was studied in blood vessels of the uterus in 120 women of reproductive age with leiomyoma and uterine fibroids. We studied the blood flow in the uterine, arcuate, ovarian arteries and the myometrium; intratumoral and peritumoral blood flow depending on the location and vascularization node histological structure and phase of the menstrual cycle. Doppler of uterine and intratumoral blood flow helped to clarify the morphological structure of the tumor, the risk of its "rapid growth" and to determine medical tactic. Features of uterine and intratumoral blood flow may be used as an additional indicator in the diagnosis of morphofunctional state of organ and tumor. It is advisable to conduct further in-depth study of the pathogenetic mechanisms of uterine leiomyoma using the methods of ultrasound diagnostics.

In 19 women with uterine leiomyoma 15 minutes prior to surgery terlipressin was administered in para¬cervical route in the dosage 0. 6 mg in 10 ml of normal saline. In the comparison group, which was also consisted of 19 women in the presence of significant blood loss during myoma resection intravenous oxytocin was used. The use of terlipressin helped to reduce the volume of blood loss during surgery almost by 2 times, reduced the duration of surgery and the risk of postoperative complications. On the basis of the ultrasonic doppler blood flow studies in uterine vessels, morphological and immunohistochemical studies of hemocapillars density in removed myoma nodules it was found that terlipressin contributes significantly to reduction of the number of functioning blood vessels and also to reduction of blood flow in all parts of the vascular system both in <b>uterus</b> and in <b>leiomyoma,</b> whereas oxytocin was not observed to decrease myometrium perfusion.

The aim {{of the study was to}} present the case of a 53 -year-old woman with triple location in the lungs, parametria and appendix. She had undergone a myomectomy 26 years earlier. In 2015, she was admitted to the surgical department because of abdominal pain, whereupon a cholecystectomy was performed. CT scans showed pelvic mass with pulmonary metastasis. Upon discharge the patient was referred to the Gynecology Clinic, where a laparotomy was performed. The intraoperative findings were: 1) <b>uterus</b> with multiple <b>leiomyomas,</b> 2) four tumors in the parametria, 3) tumor connected to the appendix. A subtotal hysterectomy, with a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, removal of the tumors from the parametria and appendectomy was performed. Pathology confirmed the diagnosis based on morphology and immunohistochemical staining (strongly positive for estrogen receptors and SMA, while Ki 67 was very low, below 1 %). Upon postoperative recovery, the patient was referred to the Thoracic Surgery Department. During the thoracotomy, multiple nodes, surrounded by lung parenchyma, were revealed. Wedge resection was performed, for localized pulmonary lesions, and sent for pathological examination. The final pathological diagnosis was benign metastasizing leiomyomatosis. In conclusion, the triple location of BML could possibly be a result of a parallel different metastasizing mechanism, although it is impossible to exclude one mechanism, which may be the cause of the metastases in three locations...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Leiomyoma {{in one of}} {{the most}} common benign endometrial cancers. Location of the myoma in the cervix and the area of the broad {{ligament}} of the <b>uterus</b> is rare. <b>Leiomyoma</b> cellulare (LC) occurs in about 5. 0 % of leiomyoma cases. Aim of the research: To determine the occurrence of LC among 294 cases of myomas as well as myomas and uterine endometriosis, found in postoperative examinations. Material and methods: Patients were qualified for the surgery based on a gynaecological examination, an ultrasonographic examination and a histological assessment of scrapings from the uterine cavity. The final diagnosis was given at the Centre of Pathomorphology of the Radom Specialist Hospital in Radom, based on a microscopic examination of postoperative material. Clinical analysis was performed in 16 cases, where LC was diagnosed during postoperative examination. Results : Among the women operated on due to myomas (n = 179; 60. 9 %) as well as myomas and reproductive organ endometriosis (n = 115; 39. 1 %), LC tissue was diagnosed during histopathological examination in 9 (5. 0 %) and 7 (6. 1 %) cases, respectively. The average age of the LC patients was 45. 6, whereas in patients with myomas as well as myomas and reproductive organ endometriosis it was 49. 1. The average age of LC patients was significantly lower in relation to patients operated on due to reproductive organ myomas. In 87. 5 % of the cases, LC was found in myomas situated in the body of the uterus; and in the remaining 12. 5 % (2 cases), in the cervix and the area of the parametrium.
