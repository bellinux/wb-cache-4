"Unfortunate indeed," [...] {{cried the}} Duchess, [...] "precisely BECAUSE they're unmarried, and unmarried, if you don't mind my saying so, {{a good deal}} because they're unmarriageable.

60|$|She flung a cloak round her, went to {{the door}} and opened it. Every blade, every twig was still. The air was yet thick with moisture, though {{somewhat}} less dense than during the afternoon, and a steady smack of drops upon the fallen leaves under the boughs was almost musical in its soothing regularity. It seemed better {{to be out of the}} house than within it, and Bathsheba closed the door, and walked slowly down the lane till she came opposite to Gabriel's cottage, where he now lived alone, having left Coggan's house through being pinched for room. There was a light in one window only, and that was downstairs. The shutters were not closed, nor was any blind or curtain drawn over the window, neither robbery nor observation being a contingency which could do much injury to the occupant of the domicile. Yes, it was Gabriel himself who was sitting up: he was reading. From her standing-place in the road she could see him plainly, sitting quite still, his light curly head upon his hand, and only occasionally looking <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>snuff</b> the candle which stood beside him. At length he looked at the clock, seemed surprised at the lateness of the hour, closed his book, and arose. He was going to bed, she knew, and if she tapped it must be done at once.|$|E
