Most <b>unit</b> <b>cards</b> have a single move per turn - and some units have special abilities that can usually only be cast once per turn. This creates a game play mechanic for the player where they must carefully manage not only the cards in their hand, but also the movement of their units on the game board while defending against the movements of their opponent.|$|R
50|$|When an Ogre Champion (1 <b>unit)</b> <b>card</b> {{is played}} the six ogre cards (three saying ogre moves and three saying ogre attacks) are shuffled and drawn {{one at a}} time. The ogre must then move {{in the order of}} the cards (i.e. if the cards are in the order moves, moves, attacks, moves, attacks, attacks) then the ogre {{champion}} must move and attack in that order, but can always choose not to take the action. For every wound the ogre takes, he draws one less card. The ogre champion has 6 hit points, while all other units have only 3.|$|E

5000|$|The {{card game}} uses three main types of cards: <b>Unit</b> <b>cards,</b> Special cards and Terrain <b>cards.</b> Each <b>Unit</b> and Special <b>card</b> is {{specific}} {{to one of}} the sides unlike the Terrain cards which are neutral and can be used by either side. These Terrain cards are used to lay out the Battlefield on which the game is played and do not move once in place. <b>Unit</b> <b>cards</b> are the actual fighting forces separated into three groups: infantry, armor and aircraft. These are the cards you deploy into the Battlefield to fight against the enemy’s <b>units.</b> Special <b>cards</b> include obstacles and abnormal events that may aid in specific strategies being implemented. If a <b>Unit</b> or Special <b>card</b> that you put into play gets destroyed, the opposing team adds the “Supply Cost” indicated on the card to their total points at the battle’s conclusion. [...] The battle is completed when a side captures the opposing side’s HQ or Headquarters, thus taking control over the entire field of play. This is the point at which each side will add up the total number of points earned from destroying the opposing team’s cards. An additional 5 points is awarded to the player who successfully captured the opposing HQ. The player with the highest number of points wins the war, thus, it is possible to win the battle by capturing the HQ, without winning the war as a whole.|$|R

50|$|When {{constructing}} a deck to play with, {{there is no}} limit to how many cards you may use, but decks cannot contain more than eight of any one <b>Unit</b> <b>card</b> or more than two of any one Special card. Each player must have six Terrain cards in their deck, from which, three are drawn at random and {{placed in front of}} each respective player representing the edge of battle. The total number of Supply Cost points laid down by each player is then subtracted from their beginning Supply Points (U.S. starts with 21, Germany starts with 27). A rolled die that’s even numbered allows the U.S. to put down its remaining three Terrain cards at no charge from their Supply Cost. An odd number rolled gives the same privilege to the player representing Germany. In both cases, the player whose number is not rolled, they must discard their remaining three Terrain cards. At this point each player uses their remaining Supply Cost Points to select their starting forces from their Unit and Special cards. These cards are then placed around the players’ respective Terrains to form a square. From each remaining deck, the players draw seven cards to form the starting hand and the game is ready to begin.|$|E
5000|$|At {{this point}} it would good to state {{that there are two}} types of T-1 circuits; Channelized T-1 and Full T-1 - (Channelized T-1) is where by you have 24 {{channels}} of 64k each that can carry voice traffic and commonly found as the CO (Central Office) trunk in a PBX. In this case a DID or Direct Inward Dial would be used. A DID is where by you would have a T-1 and have say 100 phone numbers used to dial in to a business. The chances that all 24 channels of the T-1 being used at the same time would be small, however the PBX and business would need to study the capacity needed for multi T-1s. These same T-1 channels can also be used for out bound calls as well. (Full T-1) is where you use the entire 1.544 Mb of the T-1 for data. This data can be anything from company servers or the internet. Any data can be placed on the Full T-1. It’s worth noting, you can place data on a channelized T-1, but you’re limited to the 64k bandwidth of the channel. Several channels can be used to add capacity. The T-1 uses a pair of twisted copper wires from the CO (Central Office) the local on premise NIU (network Interface <b>Unit)</b> <b>card.</b> Pictured to the above right is a two card wall mount cabinet. Under the wall cabinet is a smart jack (RJ45). The NIU then uses 4 twisted copper wires to the end device (i.e. CISCO Router, Firewall, PBX, etc.) by a Cat 3 or high network type jumper cable.|$|E

40|$|A typical neuroimaging {{study will}} produce a 3 D brain {{statistic}} image that summarises the evidence for activation during the experiment. However, for practical reasons those images are rarely published; instead, authors only report the (x,y,z) locations of local maxima in the statistic image. Neuroimaging meta-analyses use these foci from multiple studies to find areas of consistent activation across the human brain. However, current methods in the field do not account for study-specific characteristics. Therefore, we propose a fully Bayesian model based on log-Gaussian Cox processes that allows {{for the inclusion of}} study-specific variables. We present an efficient MCMC scheme based on the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate draws from the posterior. Computational time is significantly reduced through a parallel implementation using a graphical processing <b>unit</b> <b>card.</b> We evaluate the method on both simulated and real data.

40|$|Convolutional auto-encoders {{have shown}} their {{remarkable}} performance in stacking to deep convolutional neural networks for classifying image data during past several years. However, {{they are unable}} to construct the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks due to their intrinsic architectures. In this regard, we propose a flexible convolutional auto-encoder by eliminating the constraints on the numbers of convolutional layers and pooling layers from the traditional convolutional auto-encoder. We also design an architecture discovery method by using particle swarm optimization, which is capable of automatically searching for the optimal architectures of the proposed flexible convolutional auto-encoder with much less computational resource and without any manual intervention. We use the designed architecture optimization algorithm to test the proposed flexible convolutional auto-encoder through utilizing one graphic processing <b>unit</b> <b>card</b> on four extensively used image classification datasets.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{developing}} computer catalogs is proposed {{which does not}} require <b>unit</b> <b>card</b> conversion but rather the accumulation of data from operating programs. It is proposed that the bibliographic and finding functions of the catalog be separated, with the latter being the first automated.

It is not difficult to support. this hy-pothesis. One need only examine the operating costs of almost any library sys-tem over the past few years. The costs of creating and maintaining card cata-logs represent a significant portion of most academic library budgets; as cata-logs increase in size along with collec-tions and multiply with decentraliza-tion, these costs increase out of propor-tion to the growth of the library's total budget.

40|$|The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a {{powerful}} particle accelerator built in Geneva (Switzerland), developed to achieve proton beam collisions at 14 TeV. It comprises four experiments: ALICE, CMS, LHCb and ATLAS, this last one being a general purpose particle detector. The ATLAS Hadronic Tile Calorimeter (TileCal) {{is one of its}} sub-systems, which is designed to measure the energy carried by the particles that cross the detector. The Read-Out Driver (ROD) is a key element of the TileCal data acquisition chain. It processes, in real time, the digitized information coming from the front-end electronics and sends it to the Read-Out System. Data processing in the ROD boards is performed in Processing Unit Mezzanine Cards that use commercial DSPs to run the Optimal Filtering (OF) algorithms. Present-day FPGAs contain DSP slices, giving the designers the possibility to implement these algorithms and, at the same time, to exploit the flexibility that these devices provide to easily upgrade the system to new functionalities by modifying only the firmware. The hardware platform to test the implementation of the OF algorithm will be a prototype of a FPGA-based Mezzanine Processing <b>Unit</b> <b>card.</b> It has been designed to be fully compatible with the present-system, but is also suitable for studying the possibilities of providing extended functionalities.
