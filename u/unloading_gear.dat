40|$|In many manual transmissions, {{conditions}} for the onset of vibro-impacts from an <b>unloaded</b> <b>gear</b> pair {{are more likely than}} from an engaged set. Although some of the general characteristics of neutral gear rattle are known, no specific analytical models are available in the literature that can explain interactions between <b>unloaded</b> and loaded <b>gear</b> pairs in the drive rattle mode. For the sake of illustration, a particular problem for a light duty truck is studied in this paper and dynamic interactions are investigated. Some experimental measurements are first presented to define the <b>unloaded</b> <b>gear</b> rattle problem. Linear and non-linear mathematical models of the driveline are developed to understand, quantify and control the rattle problem.

40|$|Torsional {{systems with}} gear pairs {{such as the}} gearbox of wind {{turbines}} or vehicle driveline systems inherently show impact phenomena due to clearance-type nonlinearities when the system experiences sinusoidal excitation. This research investigates the vibro-impact energy of <b>unloaded</b> <b>gears</b> in geared systems using the harmonic balance method (HBM) in both the frequency and time domains. To achieve accurate simulations, nonlinear models with piecewise and clearance-type nonlinearities and drag torques are defined and implemented in the HBM.

The results are correlated with prior research by defining the gear rattle criteria with key parameters.

50|$|Self-unloading {{equipment}} is {{usually in the}} form of a boom on deck. The boom is usually positioned on the back half of the vessel, pointing forward. The boom is swung out to either side of the vessel, a conveyor system is started, and the offloading process begins. The boom is a much more efficient method of unloading and allows the boat to serve a wider variety of ports which have no shore-side <b>unloading</b> <b>gear.</b> This also allows a greater variety of cargoes to be hauled and, therefore, the opportunity to run more trips each season. Many historic straight deckers have been converted to self-unloaders or retired from service. For instance, the steam-powered straight decker James Norris was converted to a self-unloader in 1980 but, by 2008, still had not been converted from steam to diesel. The largest straight-decker, the 806-foot John Sherwin has not sailed under its own power since 1981, and its conversion to a diesel self-unloader in 2008 was suspended because of the world economic downturn.Some self unloaders can have a rather straight decker look. For example, the 1000-foot Stewart J. Cort has a shuttle boom inside the aft deckhouse. The shuttle boom can be extended to reach hoppers on the docks, specially designed for the purpose.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a test rig {{for the experimental}} validation of theoretical models to analyze the automotive drive-line dynamic behaviour accounting {{for the presence of}} oil between the impacting teeth of the gear pairs. The rig is constituted by a single gear pair, driven by an electric motor controlled in speed by an inverter.

In particular the experimental study regards the acquisition of vibrations, originated during the impacts of an <b>unloaded</b> <b>gear</b> pair, responsible of the “gear rattle noise” phenomenon. At the present the automotive manufacturers investigate experimentally the gear rattle phenomenon generally comparing different cases by the measures of the noise level using microphones.

40|$|Due to the {{irregularity}} of the I. C. engine torque, {{the impacts}} between the tooth of the <b>unloaded</b> <b>gear</b> pairs of {{a gear box}} produce vibrations originating an acoustic phenomenon, known as “gear rattle noise”. The paper presents a theoretical study on the dynamic behaviour of automotive transmissions focusing {{on the presence of}} oil between the impacting tooth of the meshing gears. This rattle phenomenon is particularly audible at low regimes and regards all the gear pairs different from the gear inserted to transmit the power. Another operating condition that manifests the gear rattle phenomenon is typically the “idle condition”, when all the gear pairs are meshing but without loading. The presence of oil between the impacting tooth of the gear pairs can play a positive role to decrease the vibrations and than the rattle noise level. In the paper some driveline complete models comprising many components as flywheel, clutch, primary and secondary shafts, are described accounting for the presence of oil lubricant between the teeth of the <b>unloaded</b> <b>gear</b> pairs. The described models consider an oil film lubrication between the tooth of the gear pairs, starting from the Reynolds equation and adopting some hypotheses regarding in particular the oil squeeze effect and also hypotheses about the teeth shape. Moreover some dissipative terms as friction and hysteresis in the clutch springs together with the oil drag torque in the gear box elements have been considered and modelled in the article...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis work proposes an {{original}} non-intrusive approach {{to detect and}} quantify rattle noise in automotive gearboxes operating under non-stationary conditions by means of vibration or instantaneous angular speed measurements. Rattle noise is produced by vibro impacts between teeth of <b>unloaded</b> <b>gears</b> excited by the engine acyclism. It appears during acceleration or deceleration phases and its detection requires the analysis of non-stationary signals. In order {{to take advantage of}} the repetitive nature of the impacts, an angle/time cyclostationary approach is introduced. Rattle noise is thus characterized through the angle/time duality: the cyclic frequency expressed in events per revolution is directly linked to the periodicity of the impacts while their frequency content is expressed in Hertz. The proposed detection method uses an order/frequency spectral coherence and may be applied either on vibration signals or instantaneous angular speed signals. For validation purposes, a specific instrumentation of a gearbox is set up. The relative speed of the <b>unloaded</b> meshing <b>gears</b> is observed by means of optical encoders to directly detect the instants of impact which then serve as a basis for validation of the non-intrusive detection method proposed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} gear rattle induced by multi-harmonic excitation. The analysis is conducted by an experimental point of view. The excitation of gear rattle in the automotive gear box derives from the law of speed of the I. C. engine and is generally of periodic type.

40|$|The “gear rattle” {{phenomenon}} {{is a research}} topic of great interest for the NVH (Noise, Vibration and Harshness) automotive sector, concerning driveline noise and vibrations coming from the manual gear boxes. It {{is due to the}} internal combustion engine variable torque producing impacts and rebounds, and consequently noise, between the teeth of the <b>unloaded</b> <b>gear</b> pairs of the gear box because of the unavoidable presence of backlashes. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used to decompose the angular relative motion signal and the wavelet decomposition details are adopted to analyze the dynamic behaviour of gears under rattle conditions. The DWT has been chosen because it is a particularly suitable instrument to recognize discontinuities, such as jumps or instantaneous changes in the slope of the signals, due to their localization in the time domain. Wavelet analysis allows to characterize an event by the localization, the kind, and the amplitude of the event. This technique enables, moreover, to define new indices for metrics of gear rattle especially useful in order to conduct comparisons among different operative conditions. Some examples of application of the proposed technique are reported in the paper. The theoretical investigations regard comparative analysis with respect to the amplitude and to the frequency of speed fluctuations and to the gears lubrication regime...|$|R

40|$|In {{the article}} an {{investigation}} about {{the feasibility of}} a wavelet analysis for gear rattle metric in transmission gears, due to tooth impacts under unloaded conditions, is conducted. The technique adopts the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), following the Multi-resolution analysis, to decompose an experimental signal of the relative angular motion of gears into an approximation and in some detail vectors. The described procedure, previously developed by the authors, permits the qualitative evaluation of the impacts occurring between the teeth by examining in particular the detail vectors coming out from the wavelet decomposition. The technique enables discriminating between the impacts occurring on the two different sides of tooth. This situation {{is typical of the}} double-sided gear rattle produced in the automotive gear boxes. This paper considers the influence of oil lubricant, inserted between the teeth, in reducing the impacts. Analysis is performed by comparing three different lubrication conditions, and some of the classical wavelet functions adopted in literature are tested as "mother" wavelet. Moreover, comparisons with a metric based on the harmonic analysis by means of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), often adopted in this field, are conducted to put in evidence the advantages of the Wavelet technique with reference to the influence of some fundamental operative parameters. The experimental signals of the relative angular rotation of gear are acquired by two high resolution incremental encoders on a specific test rig for lightly loaded gears. The results of the proposed method appear optimistic also in the detection of defects that could produce little variations in the dynamic behavior of <b>unloaded</b> <b>gears...</b>|$|R

40|$|The general {{trend in}} gear industry, today, is an {{increased}} focus on gear transmission efficiency. Gear transmission efficiency losses arise from loaded and <b>unloaded</b> <b>gear</b> contacts, seals, lubricant and bearings. One way of minimising the losses is {{to lower the}} lubricant viscosity. This will reduce the speed dependent losses. However, the load dependent losses might increase. To avoid this, the ratio between lubricant film thickness and surface roughness must be maintained, which can be fulfilled by producing smoother gear surfaces. As {{a starting point for}} this realisation process, the present manufacturing processes, the design tools and the characteristics of the gear flank interface must be further investigated and developed. This must be achieved with an emphasis on economic production. This thesis focuses on our understanding of how different gear manufacturing methods —particularly the contribution of the running-in process—affect the surface characteristics, with the view of increasing gearbox efficiency. The thesis consists of a summary and three appended papers. Paper A and paper B discuss the relationship between design parameters and real gear wheel surfaces manufactured with different manufacturing methods. The research hypothesis was that the contact area ratio is a descriptive parameter for the contact condition. Paper A deals with the influence of manufacturing method on the initial contact conditions and also serves as a validation of the simulation program used. The emphasis in Paper B is the changes that occur during running-in, and to correlate these changes to design requirements. Paper C approaches the influences of manganese phosphate-coating and lubricants with respect to friction and the risk of scuffing at the initial contact. The main conclusions of this thesis are that the contact area ratio presents a descriptive measure of how surface topography influences the contact, seen at both a global (form deviation) and local (roughness) level. The surface topography caused by the manufacturing method has a significant influence on the contact area ratio. This is an important result, since neither national standards nor commercially available gear evaluation programs handle surface topography on the local scale. Shaving was found to have the highest contact area ratio, and should therefore be the best choice if deviations from case hardening could be minimised. It is also confirmed that gear-like surfaces coated with manganese phosphate have a low coefficient of friction, and raise the limiting load for scuffing failure enormously compared to the ground equivalent.
