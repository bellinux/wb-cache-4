30|$|FDI inflows to the Baltic {{countries}} were attracted by different factors {{during the decade}} of economic transition (Grigonytė 2010). On the one hand, FDI was mainly driven by the availability of relatively low-cost resources as the privatization process created business opportunities for foreign investors in the manufacturing sector. A qualified and relatively cheap labor force made the Baltic states attractive in the labor-intensive industries such as food, wood, and textile products. On the other hand, an <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>services</b> sector opened up scope for horizontal FDI. Particularly, the privatization of public utilities (e.g., telecommunications) and liberalization of the banking sector attracted significant FDI inflows. At the same time, the Baltic states’ convenient geographical location, located between the EU, Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, as well as EU membership attracted efficiency-seeking FDI. Successful market reforms and a relatively stable macroeconomic environment were {{the main reasons for}} attracting FDI to the Baltics.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} socio-demographic change and spatial {{transformation}} in Athens during the post war period and, in particular, {{since the early}} 1990 s. It focuses on the interaction of two parallel processes — the precipitated ageing of the native Greek population and the rapid increase of the city’s immigrant population — in terms of residential patterns that enable contact between the two groups, and of the poorly developed local welfare state, within which immigrants have been acting {{as a substitute for}} the <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>services</b> for the elderly. The paper draws attention to recent changes in immigrants’ profiles and especially to the decreasing inflow — and more recently the outflow (GSPSC, 2011) — from neighbouring Balkan countries and the parallel increase of asylum seeking migrants and refugees from war zones in the broader Middle-East, Afghanistan and the Indian peninsula. These changes have led to a potentially less beneficial co-existence between ageing and immigration for both sides in a period where public funds for social policies as well as private funds for substitute solutions become scarce...|$|E

30|$|These three {{challenges}} {{will be at}} {{the center}} of debate not only in Germany, but on both sides of the Atlantic. Regarding low-skilled labor, the country’s basic problem is not that there is not enough work to be done. It is well known that Germany has an <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>service</b> sector, parts of which are hidden in a shadow economy that is estimated to account for up to one-sixth of GDP (Schneider, [2003]). The key challenge is how to create incentives to engage in regular work. A powerful solution would be to impose the workfare principle on those receiving public benefits – i.e., no financial support without work or engagement in further education (Schneider and Zimmermann, [2010]). This measure would make it costly not to take up a regular job. That may sound harsh, but even Scandinavian welfare states have taken similar steps.|$|R

40|$|Analysiert werden die Sozialstruktur und mögliche soziale Veränderungen in vier Hafenstädten um 1800 : Altona, Kiel, Rostock und Wismar. Als Quellen dienen Einwohnerlisten und Steuerregister, aus denen über 70. 000 Fälle in die Datenbasis aufgenommen wurden und die nach einer statistischen Auswertung Auskunft über die Arbeitssituation und die wirtschaftliche Stärke der Haushalte geben. Ausgehend von den Systemen der Besteuerung in Holstein und Mecklenburg sowie von der Entwicklung sozialer Polarisation werden im Ergebnis unterschiedliche Profile der vier Städte ausgemacht: Altona war ein Zentrum für Handel, Verkehr und Bankwesen; Kiel eine Handels- und Universitätsstadt; Rostock ein Zentrum von Verkehr und Handel, ergänzend auch als Universitätsstadt; Wismar eine Stadt des Handels und Verkehrs, obgleich weniger wichtig als die anderen Städte. Während Altona und Rostock wirklich wichtige Seehäfen mit vergleichbaren Funktionen in Handel und Dienstleistungen waren, bewahrte Kiel mehr eine traditionelle soziale Struktur. Wismar blieb zurück mit unterentwickelten Dienstleistungen und einem vergleichsweise hohen Anteil an ungelernter Arbeit. (prh) 'The {{research}} project Seaports in Northern Germany in 1800 aimed {{to analyze the}} social structure and possible social change in four cities: Altona, Kiel, Rostock, and Wismar. The sources are census lists and tax registers from which about 70, 000 cases were written into databases. Two items of social structure will be statistically analyzed in this article: employment and economic strength (measured in taxation) of the households. As a result, different profiles of the four cities can be traced. The vocational structure was urban as the first economic sector was unimportant, though there were some activities in fishing in Rostock and Wismar. The second and the third sector reached equal levels in Altona, Kiel, and Rostock, whereas in Wismar the third sector was clearly weaker. Within the second sector we mostly find conformity in the basic equipment with crafts on the following ranks of branches: 1. clothing, 2. building, 3. victualling, 4. timber- and woodcraft, 5. metal processing crafts. The third sector, however, shows special profiles with different ranks. Altona: 1. commerce, 2. transportation, 3. banking and insurances, 4. health and hygiene, 5. teaching and culture on equal level with accommodation; Kiel: 1. commerce, 2. teaching and culture, 3. transportation, 4. accommodation, 5. health and hygiene; Rostock: 1. transportation, 2. commerce, 3. teaching and culture, 4. accommodation, 5. health and hygiene; Wismar: 1. commerce, 2. transportation, 3. health and hygiene, 4. teaching and culture, 5. accommodation. Hence we may infer that Altona was a centre of commerce, transportation, and banking; Kiel a commercial and university city; Rostock a centre of transportation and commerce, additionally a university city; Wismar a town of commerce and transportation, though clearly less important than her sisters. Unskilled labour had significantly less importance in Altona and Rostock than in Kiel and Wismar, which indicates similarity in higher developed professionalised employment in both Altona and Rostock. Solvency, measured in taxation, reveals different patterns of social inequality. Calculated within the systems of taxation in Holstein and Mecklenburg, the lower classes were more numerous in Altona than in Kiel, the middle classes stronger in Kiel, whereas the upper classes reached equal proportions, but payed higher amounts in Altona. on a lower level, which is mainly due to a slightly digressive taxation in Mecklenburg, the same difference existed between Rostock and Wismar. Thus in the cities of Altona and Rostock social polarization was more significant than in Kiel and Wismar, which {{seem to have been}} more harmonious in their social structure. If we suppose that sophisticated services and proceeding social polarization were signs of preindustrial modernization, the four cities may be characterized as follows. Altona and Rostock were real seaports with similar functions in commerce and services. Kiel preserved a more traditional social structure, stabilized by its function as a university town. Wismar remained backward with <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>services</b> and a comparatively high proportion of unskilled labour. The databases allow further research, for example in demography or, combined with maps, in social geography. ' (author's abstract...|$|E

Our analysis of 12 Asian economies indicates that the service sector already contributed substantially to the region’s growth in the past. Furthermore, somewhat surprisingly in light of the difficulty of achieving productivity gains in services, we also find that services labor productivity grew at a healthy pace in much of the region. Overall our analysis provides substantial cause for optimism about the role of the service sector as an engine of growth in Asia.

This thesis applies a mixed-method quantitative-qualitative sequential approach to identify and consider the relationship between socio-demographic factors and ECCE provision in the semi-remote setting of Egypt’s region of North Sinai. In addition, it seeks to uncover the perceptions of ECCE stakeholders (parents, care practitioners and policy makers) towards the existing ECCE policy and provision. The findings indicated that the socio-demographic characteristics of parents and their children, in addition to the economically disadvantaged condition of the semi-remote area affected the availability, accessibility and quality of ECCE. More specifically, children’s age and health alongside parental characteristics such as education, marital status, income, employment and family structure, significantly impacted childcare arrangements. Furthermore,localised contextual factors, such as neighbourhood poverty and infrastructure were also found to be affecting childcare provision. The data suggest that the top-down approach to ECCE policy design and implementation is to be rendered inappropriate and ineffectual in dealing with the socio-demographic realities associated with ECCE provision in North Sinai. ...|$|R

What is known about service suburbanization is primarily derived from survey research on location choices done in localized cases. There has been no comprehensive work done using secondary data on revealed behavior. This dissertation attempts that comprehensive study. The research analyzes the dynamics of locational structure of services in U. S. metropolitan areas from 1969 to 1989. The descriptive analysis {{of changes in the}} location coefficients provides evidence to demonstrate a spatial shifting of consumer oriented services roughly opposite to that of business oriented services. The top ranked business centers tend to exhibit a tendency toward greater centralization. There is a countervailing tendency toward decentralization of business oriented services in small and relatively <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>service</b> areas. According to the regional analysis, there is no clear tendency of business oriented services for the d services, however, appears to be strong for the 1969 - 89 period, especially for the Manufacturingbelt and South. Models for decentralization of consumer oriented and business oriented services indicate that the spatial dynamics of business services are different from those of consumer services. Relocation costs appear to be greater for business services than for consumer services. By contrast, service demand and racial composition seem to have a greater influence on decentralization of consumer services than on business services. The relocation costs are also likely to encourage more centralization of consumer and business services over a longer time span. The locational effects of corporate demand and decentralization of manufacturing activity, on the contrary, appear to weaken over a longer time span...|$|R

40|$|Using an {{integrated}} simulation model, the authors estimate {{the scope and}} speed of population-aging in China, the cost of supporting the old, {{and the impact of}} different reform options and pension arrangements. Among their conclusions: The scope and speed of population-aging in China make the present pension system financially unsustainable, even assuming that GDP grows steadily in the long term. Moving the retirement age back would provide a temporary fix for the current pay-as-you-go pension system but would be politically viable only where there is great demand for labor. Pension funds could be made more sustainable by increasing GDP growth, raising contribution rates, or gradually reducing benefit rates. But the financial costs and social obstacles of those reform options must be carefully assessed. Fully funded, privately managed pension schemes might be feasible, but require a sound regulatory framework and institutional infrastructure,including financial markets that provide adequate savings instruments and insurance options. Pension reform is a long-term, multidimensional problem involving economic, social, political, and cultural factors. Governments should not focus only on taxes and transfers to redistribute income to and among the elderly. Real income growth is needed to cope with poverty among the elderly, especially in developing countries. To establish an adequate, efficient, and equitable social security system, China must maintain long-term socioeco nomic stability and sustainable growth. China could improve the labor market by removing management rigidities, facilitating human resource development, making labor markets more competitive, improving the household registration system, improving incentives, and rewarding hard and innovative work. To reduce unemployment, China can create more job opportunities in nontraditional sectors, especially its <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>service</b> industries. To shift jobs to the nonagricultural sector, it can develop medium-size cities. And to cushion the impact of demographic shocks, China should preserve traditional values and maintain family-community support. Drawing on experience in Europe and Latin America, China should move toward a transparent and decentralized system with 1) a fully funded, portable, defined-benefit pension plan, designed to meet basic needs, and 2) occupational pension plans or personal savings accounts to satisfy demand for maintaining or improving living standards.

Beijing genotype strains showed high rates of mutation within a wide range of drug concentrations, possibly explaining this genotype’s association with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. The emergence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance to antituberculosis (anti-TB) drugs is a major public health challenge that is threatening World Health Organization targets set for the elimination of TB (1). Approximately 500, 000 cases of multidrugresistant TB (MDR TB) are diagnosed annually, but the true magnitude of the MDR TB problem is not known because adequate laboratory tools are lacking.

30|$|The {{reforms to}} the service sector and the tax system suggest that the Chinese {{government}} has become stronger and stronger in pursuing economic growth, thus intervening in and even replacing the market mechanism, while simultaneously becoming weaker and weaker {{in the provision of}} public servicesk. Government officials have an incentive to pursue GDP growth because they can gain promotions and ‘benefit’ (that is, creating and seeking all kinds of rents). If they do what they should do (i.e., provide public services), the opportunities for ‘benefit’ are very limited. This has damaged social and business honesty, making market transactions more costly, and has hindered the division of labor and the externalization of producer services. The third and fourth developments since the early 1990 s (outlined above) mean that, in effect, government expenditure is squeezing out household expenditure, and government investment policies (via SOEs and SOBs) are discouraging and even forcing out private investment. The emphasis in manufacturing on processing and assembly in China will likely continue, but it will be at the expense of demand for producer services, including upstream services such as R&D and downstream services such as marketing and after-sale services that are still largely controlled by foreign firms. This unusual processing trade pattern is characterized by two ends abroad and, thus, the coexistence of rapidly developing manufacturing and <b>underdeveloped</b> producer <b>services</b> at home. The overproduction of tradable commodities and the foreign exchange controls are a natural outcome of the distorted government function and behaviors.|$|R

It also documents asphyxia as a prominent cause of childhood handicap, examines aspects of its epidemiology and evaluates {{the effectiveness of a}} regimen of phenobarbitone and dexamethasone in limiting subsequent neurological deficit in asphyxiated neonates. Analysis of neonatal deaths at Cecilia Makiwane Hospital over an 18 -month period showed that asphyxia accounted for one third of all neonatal deaths. In particular, asphyxia caused two thirds of deaths in infants over 2 Kg birth weight. From a hospital register of handicapped children, 211 had cerebral palsy. Asphyxia was the cause of cerebral palsy in 33 % of these children. Spastic quadriplegia, the type of cerebral palsy most often resulting from the cerebral damage associated with asphyxial hypoxic-ischaemic insults, was by far the largest diagnostic category (57 %). Asphyxia therefore appears to be the single largest cause of significant handicap in Ciskei. In view of the <b>underdeveloped</b> support <b>services</b> to parents in most developing areas, the problem of asphyxia is of considerable importance. In the study of the epidemiology of asphyxia, details of pregnancy and labour were obtained for 163 asphyxiated term infants and 2758 non- asphyxiated term infants whose mothers had delivered in the hospital. The factors positively associated with asphyxia were: low gravidity and parity, failure to book for antenatal care, the occurrence of antenatal disorders, the occurrence of fetal distress, a prolonged first stage of labour and delivery by caesarean section or vacuum extraction. Maternal age and the actual number of antenatal visits were not associated with asphyxia. The causes of asphyxia assigned by the specialist obstetrician in charge were cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD) (39 %), utero-placental pathologies (22 %), other (8 %), and "unknown" where he could find no abnormality in pregnancy and labour (27 %). From these findings it appears that the steps that need to be taken for prevention include: active recruitment of patients to book for antenatal care, more active detection and management of cephalopelvic disproportion and basic research to elucidate the causes of the "unknown" group whom it is speculated have undetected utero-placental pathology...|$|R

40|$|Among {{policy-makers}} in Europe the {{modal shift}} - a shift från polluting modes of freight transport to less polluting modes - {{has been a}} popular suggestion for reducing CO 2 -emissions of transportation. In particular, intermodal road-rail solutions, where a combination of road and rail transport is utilized to move trailers and containers, have been stressed as an important measure to reach de desired reduction in emissions. However, {{looking back at the}} development over the last twenty years, no shift to rail-bound transport can be seen. for example, the share of rail-bound transport has decreased. There are several potential explanations to the absence of modal shift. Often, the supply-side is held responsible, with rail operators offering too low quality due to lack of standards, lack of proactivity, and general infrastructure and transport system deficiencies. Others claim the non-existent shift dependson inertia on the demand-side. Innovations on the transport market are driven by the demand-side customers {{and as long as the}} demand-side is not willing to make any adjustments to better fit the supply-side's offers, no shift will occur. Arguably, both <b>underdeveloped</b> <b>service</b> production and demand side inertia create barriers to realize the political ambitions of the EU. But supply- and demand-side problems cannot be discussed in isolation: low service quality leads to low demand and with low demand there are little incentives to invest in quality. On the intermodal transport market (and much of the trucking market as well), supply and demand is matched in contractual relations. These contracts affect the incentives of the players, and from the economics and supply chain management literature it is well known that badly designed contracts and incentives may lead to sub-optimization and double-marginalization effects, including lower production levels and less total profit than what would have been optimal. Therefore, instead of focusing on aggregate behaviour, this research approaches the modal shift by investigating t he contract that governs the sale and purchase of these services. The purpose, is to build a model to explore the currently used contracts on the intermodal market, explain how these contracts may have affected the modal shift, and explore how changes in the contracts and market conditions could increase the share of intermodal transport. The purpose is approached through a research process in which the findings from two company cases, Bring Frigo and Volvo Logistics, are used to model the system. We consider a situation in which a Service Provider approaches an Intermodal Operator to build the service capacity that the service provider can use to satisfy demand created by the upstream Shippers. The system is then modeled as a one-period, continuous, newsvendor modal with fixed costs associated with each train put into operation. Any demand which cannot be satisfied by the intermodal operator is handled by a truck carrier. Contrary to the trucking market, the Operator is the leader in our Stackelberg game, in which the Service Provider decides upon the final modal mix. It is found in the cases that the operators tend to have a strict production focus, preferring to transfer the responsibility of filling the train to the service provider. Since the service providers are used to having very low fixed costs (no own assets), they claim that this way of selling the capacity inhibits the possibilities to increase the rail-share of their modal mix. In the model, we therefore investigate two possible ways to contract the capacity: 1) through a unit price per trailer, in which an arbitrary number of trailers is sold to the service provider at a unit price per trailer, and 2) with a service charge per train, in which the operator charges a fixed rate for operating each train, leaving the responsibility to fill the train to the service provider. The research characterizes these contracts and show that the operator prefers a per-train charge in most instances: the production focus in inherent with the current market structure. It is also shown that the per-train type of payment coordinates the system in several instances and thus outperforms the unit price preferred by the operator. In that, the production focus has no negative impact in the modal mix in these instances. However, none of the contract types can guarantee coordination, leading to lower total profits than optimal. We therefore show how a three-part tariff, in which the operator charges a unit cost per trailer, a service charge per train, and a wealth-transferring component, can achieve full coordination. Such a contract may however be difficult to implement due to its complexity. Analysis with the model shows that policy measures such as a general carbon tax under some circumstances may increase the amount of intermodal capacity although this may not always be the case due to decentralized decision-making. Measures aiming at reducing the financial risks of the markets, such as allowing longer trains, reducing slot-fees, or introducing a well-functioning spor-market may more easily achieve a higher intermodal share. In that, the research provides insight on the mechanisms on the micro-level that may affect the realization of the political visions, with implications for operators and service providers as well as policy-makers. In particular, the semi-fixed cost structure of the intermodal investment has been poorly addressed in the past, and by analyzing the impact this has on the capacity investment, the study builds on previos research on green logistics, as well as mode choice, capacity management, and supply chain contracting. Finally suggestions for future research along the four potential paths are discussed: empirical research to understand the actual rather complex market; relax model assumptions regarding number of time periods, compliance regime, private information, hidden actions and risk aversion; include more players as shippers and infra structure owners; and compare results with other service markets very capacity is "lumpy"...|$|R
40|$|The {{difficulties}} {{faced by}} {{services in the}} cultural sector have been immediate and challenging. Public services that are cultural in nature have faced funding cuts, closures and redundancies. Museum services are low in political importance and unable to provide clear evidence of their policy impact. Despite these challenges, there has been limited evidence about the policy process at ground-level. This thesis builds on theoretical and empirical ideas in social and cultural policy to present museum workers’ perspectives within a cultural theory framework. Following Lipsky’s (1980) work on street-level bureaucrats, this thesis presents an analysis of street-level workers’ roles in delivering social and cultural policy. Museum workers’ perspectives are presented {{through a series of}} case studies (drawing on qualitative interviews and observations) from three local-authority museum services in England, Scotland and Wales. The findings showed evidence that top-down cultural and social policies have had an influence on workers actions, but service-level workers’ understandings were central to the policy process. Museum workers actively shaped museum policy through ground-level interactions with visitors and groups. Workers experienced policy in the cultural sector as fragmented, vague and difficult to engage with at the ground-level. Workers mainly viewed policy as meaningless rhetoric. Despite this, those working at ground-level often utilised policy rhetoric effectively to gain funding and manipulate activities towards their own needs and interpretations. Policy evaluation was also fragmented and <b>underdeveloped</b> within the <b>services</b> studied. Workers found themselves under pressure to fulfil policy objectives but were unable to show how they did this. Furthermore, there was a perceived distance from managers and local authority structures. This allowed a space for workers to implement and shape policy towards their own professional and personal ideals. Vague policies and a lack of formal mechanisms for evaluation led to high levels of worker discretion at ground-level. Economic policy expectations were resisted by workers, who tended to have more egalitarian views. Museum workers effectively managed policy expectations through a mixture of discretion and policy manipulation. Delivery at the ground-level was seen as effective – despite, not because of, cultural sector policies...|$|R
