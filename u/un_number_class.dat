50|$|<b>UN</b> <b>numbers</b> (United Nations numbers) are four-digit {{numbers that}} {{identify}} hazardous materials, and articles (such as explosives, Flammable Liquids to oxidizing solid or toxic liquids, etc.) {{in the framework}} of international transport. Some hazardous substances have their own <b>UN</b> <b>numbers</b> (e.g. acrylamide has UN 2074), while sometimes groups of chemicals or products with similar properties receive a common <b>UN</b> <b>number</b> (e.g. flammable liquids, not otherwise specified, have UN1993). A chemical in its solid state may receive a different <b>UN</b> <b>number</b> than the liquid phase if their hazardous properties differ significantly; substances with different levels of purity (or concentration in solution) may also receive different <b>UN</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R

50|$|Using successors, limits, and cardinality, Cantor {{generated}} an unbounded {{sequence of}} ordinal <b>numbers</b> and <b>number</b> <b>classes.</b> The (α + 1)-th <b>number</b> <b>class</b> is {{the set of}} ordinals whose predecessors form a set of the same cardinality as the α-th <b>number</b> <b>class.</b> The cardinality of the (α + 1)-th <b>number</b> <b>class</b> is the cardinality immediately following that of the α-th <b>number</b> <b>class.</b> For a limit ordinal α, the α-th <b>number</b> <b>class</b> is the union of the β-th <b>number</b> <b>classes</b> for β < α. Its cardinality is the limit of the cardinalities of these <b>number</b> <b>classes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{phrase is}} also used within the List of <b>UN</b> <b>numbers,</b> where it refers to a generic entry, e.g. [...] "UN 1993: Flammable liquid, N.O.S.".|$|R
5000|$|If n is finite, the n-th <b>number</b> <b>class</b> has {{cardinality}} [...] If α ≥ ω, the α-th <b>number</b> <b>class</b> has cardinality [...] Therefore, the cardinalities of the <b>number</b> <b>classes</b> correspond one-to-one {{with the}} aleph numbers. Also, the α-th <b>number</b> <b>class</b> consists of ordinals {{different from those}} in the preceding <b>number</b> <b>classes</b> if and only if α is a non-limit ordinal. Therefore, the non-limit <b>number</b> <b>classes</b> partition the ordinals into pairwise disjoint sets.|$|R

50|$|The second theorem {{requires}} {{proving the}} existence of an α such that P(α) = ∅. To prove this, Cantor considered the set of all α having countably many predecessors. To define this set, he defined the transfinite ordinal numbers and transformed the infinite indices into ordinals by replacing ∞ with ω, the first transfinite ordinal number. Cantor called the set of finite ordinals the first <b>number</b> <b>class.</b> The second <b>number</b> <b>class</b> is the set of ordinals whose predecessors form a countably infinite set. The set of all α having countably many predecessors—that is, the set of countable ordinals—is the union of these two <b>number</b> <b>classes.</b> Cantor proved that the cardinality of the second <b>number</b> <b>class</b> is the first uncountable cardinality.|$|R
