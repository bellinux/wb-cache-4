5|$|General de Kalb's forces took {{almost a}} month to descend the Chesapeake Bay and did not arrive in Petersburg, Virginia <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> June, {{almost a month}} after Lincoln had {{surrendered}} his army. The Continental Congress appointed Horatio Gates to command the Southern Department.

In the brain, cytoplasmic polyadenylation is active during learning and could {{play a role in}} long-term potentiation, which is the strengthening of the signal transmission from a nerve cell to another in response to nerve impulses and is important for learning and memory formation.|$|E
5|$|Life in the Middle Ages {{centred on}} the {{families}} who owned the manor {{in what was then}} an isolated rural community. Agriculture, hand loom weaving, quarrying and mining occupied the few inhabitants <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the 19th century. A chapel built before 1541 was replaced by the present church in 1666 and by 1703 Nonconformism led to the building of a Presbyterian church, now a Unitarian Chapel. A grammar school was founded by charter of Queen Elizabeth I in 1556.|$|E
5|$|When {{the modern}} border between Wales and England was {{established}} by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542, many Welsh-speaking communities found themselves on the English side of the border.

5|$|As {{the first}} group of Chinese people to settle in large numbers, the Hokkien of {{southern}} Fujian became the dominant immigrant group <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the 19th century. Their maritime-mercantile culture comes from their trade occupations whilst in Indonesia. Descendants of Hokkiens are the dominant group in eastern Indonesia, Central and East Java, and the western coast of Sumatra. Teochews, southern neighbors of the Hokkien, are found throughout the eastern coast of Sumatra, in the Riau Archipelago, and in western Borneo. They were preferred as plantation laborers in Sumatra, but have become traders in regions where the Hokkien are not well represented.|$|E
5|$|Because White did {{not officially}} depart Minnesota <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> his second semester, he was academically ineligible {{to receive a}} {{scholarship}} from any Division I school in 2010. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) usually requires a two semester residency for transfers. He transferred to Iowa State prior to using any of his athletic eligibility at Minnesota and applied to the NCAA for a waiver to be eligible to play during the 2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, but the NCAA denied his waiver. Iowa State appealed the decision, but their appeal was denied.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of November 1846, the settlers had reached the Sierra Nevada where they became trapped by an early, heavy snowfall near Truckee (now Donner) Lake, high in the mountains. Their food supplies ran extremely low and, in mid-December, some of the group set out on foot to obtain help. Rescuers from California attempted to reach the settlers, but the first relief party did not arrive <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> February 1847, almost {{four months after the}} wagon train had become trapped. Of the 87 members of the party, 48 survived to reach California, many of them having eaten the dead for survival.|$|E

5|$|Cowes Castle, {{also known}} as West Cowes Castle, is a Device Fort in Cowes on the Isle of Wight. Originally built by Henry VIII in 1539 to protect England against the threat of {{invasion}} from France and the Holy Roman Empire, it comprised a circular bastion, flanking wings and a keep, and in 1547 it housed 17 pieces of artillery. With its companion fortification at East Cowes, the castle overlooked {{the entrance to the}} River Medina, an important anchorage. The invasion threat passed but the fortification continued in use <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the 19th century, very briefly seeing action in 1642 during the English Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Edwin's realm {{was divided}} at his death. He was succeeded by Osric, son of Edwin's {{paternal}} uncle Ælfric, in Deira, and by Eanfrith, son of Æthelfrith and Edwin's sister Acha, in Bernicia. Both reverted to paganism, {{and both were}} killed by Cadwallon; eventually Eanfrith's brother Oswald defeated and killed Cadwallon and united Northumbria once more. Thereafter, {{with the exception of}} Oswine son of Osric, power in Northumbria was {{in the hands of the}} Idings, the descendants of Ida of Bernicia, <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the 8th century.|$|E
5|$|However, {{war with}} England {{continued}} {{for several decades}} {{after the death of}} Bruce. A civil war between the Bruce dynasty and their long-term Comyn-Balliol rivals lasted <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the 14th century. Although the Bruce dynasty was successful, David II's lack of an heir allowed his half-nephew Robert II to come to the throne and establish the Stewart Dynasty. The Stewarts ruled Scotland {{for the remainder of the}} Middle Ages. The country they ruled experienced greater prosperity from the end of the 14th century through the Scottish Renaissance to the Reformation. This was despite continual warfare with England, the increasing division between Highlands and Lowlands, and a large number of royal minorities.|$|E

5|$|In the 17thcentury, Aarhus {{entered a}} period of {{recession}} as it suffered blockades and bombardments during the Swedish wars and trade was dampened by the preferential treatment of the capital by the state. It was not <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the 18thcentury growth returned in large part due to trade with the large agricultural catchment areas around the city; particularly grain {{proved to be a}} remunerative export. The first factories were established at this time as the industrial revolution reached the country and in 1810 the harbour was expanded to accommodate growing trade.|$|E
5|$|Leather was not {{infrequently}} used {{even for}} the costly and elaborate chairs of the faldstool form—occasionally sheathed in thin plates of silver—which Venice sent all over Europe. To this day, indeed, leather {{is one of the}} most frequently employed materials for chair covering. The outstanding characteristic of most chairs <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the 17th century was massiveness and solidity. Being usually made of oak, they were of considerable weight, and it was not until the introduction of the handsome Louis XIII chairs with cane backs and seats that either weight or solidity was reduced.|$|E
5|$|Mildred Walpole {{found it}} hard to settle in New Zealand, and {{something}} of her restlessness and insecurity affected the character of her eldest child.

60|$|A strong party {{among the}} Quakers of New Jersey opposed slavery for many years, {{and the system}} was denounced at some of their yearly meetings; and this went on <b>until</b> about <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next century, when a law was made that no person owning slaves should {{continue}} in the Society of Friends.|$|R
5|$|On 10 July 1137 Pain {{was killed}} by a javelin blow to the head during an ambush by the Welsh as he was leading a relief {{expedition}} to the garrison at Carmarthen. He was buried in Gloucester Abbey, following a funeral service conducted by Robert de Bethune. A number of barons from the Welsh Marches attended, including Miles of Gloucester. Pain's widow continued to hold Ludlow Castle <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> 1139, when she was forced to surrender it to King Stephen. Stephen then gave Sybil in marriage to Jocelin de Dinan, who consequently acquired Ludlow Castle through his new wife, setting up the background to Gilbert Lacy's attempts to seize Ludlow from Dinan on which the medieval Welsh romance work Fouke le Fitz Waryn is based.|$|E
5|$|On both ships, {{two more}} quadruple sets of 1.1in guns were added {{in place of}} two {{searchlights}} amidships. After she was torpedoed in 1942, North Carolina had these removed and ten quadruple sets of 40mm guns added. Fourteen were present by June 1943, while a fifteenth mount was added {{on top of the}} third main turret that November. Washington retained its six 1.1in quads <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> 1943, when ten quad 40mm guns replaced them. By August, she had fifteen. The two ships carried these through to the close of the war.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{the crew}} {{successfully}} completed all fifty-four {{of the planned}} mission test objectives. While the INSAT deployment was a success, the satellite had problems unfolding its solar array once in geostationary orbit, and was not fully operational <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> September. Once functional, however, it provided satisfactory service for seven years, returning 36,000 images of Earth and broadcasting television to thousands of remote Indian villages. The Payload Flight Test Article evaluation found that the Canadarm remote manipulator system was capable of moving bulky masses with some accuracy, to a precision of 5cm and one degree of alignment.|$|E
