In this context, “Eco-“ refers to both economic (e. g., earthquake hazard mitigation) and ecological motivation. The first step in this instillation was to insert a telemetry/power system into the submarine coaxial cable; this system could then service the MODOBO, which consist of seven major bottom sensor packages. During August-September 1999, using a deep-towed unit and both manned and <b>unmanned</b> <b>submersibles</b> coupled with precise ship navigation, the MDOBO system and its attendant cables were deployed over a range of distances from 80 m to 1 km from the telemetry system, with several meter allowance for navigational uncertainty in positioning.

One identified solution is moving the primary thrusters in both the pitch and yaw directions. The robot is propelled {{by a pair of}} 2 DOF thrusters, and is directly controlled in heave, surge, sway, yaw, and roll. Pitch is controlled through passive buoyancy and, potentially, active manipulation of added mass and gyroscopic effects. This system is compared against a traditional fixed-thruster system in terms of cost, size, weight, and high/low speed performance. Preliminary results indicate that the actuated system can provide an improved thrust-to-mass metric at the expense of increased system complexity. This margin of improvement increases with increasing thruster size. The system has applications in high accuracy positioning areas such as ship hull inspection, recovery, and exploration. by Daniel G. Walker. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Autonomous {{underwater}} vehicles (AUVs) are <b>unmanned</b> <b>submersibles</b> {{that can}} be pre-programmed to navigate in three dimensions under water. The technological advances required for reliable deployment, mission control, performance, and recovery of AUVs have developed considerably over the past 10 years. Currently, there are several vehicles operating successfully in the offshore industries {{as well as in}} the applied and academic oceanographic sciences. This article reviews the application of AUVs to fisheries- and plankton-acoustics research. Specifications of the main AUVs currently in operation are given. Compared to traditional platforms for acoustic instruments, AUVs can sample previously impenetrable environments such as the sea surface, the deep sea, and under-sea ice. Furthermore, AUVs are typically small, quiet, and have the potential to operate at low cost and be unconstrained by the vagaries of weather. Examples of how these traits may be utilized in fisheries-acoustics science are given with reference to previous work in the North Sea and Southern Ocean and to potential future applications. Concurrent advances in multi-beam sonar technology and species identification, using multi-frequency and broadband sonars, will further enhance the utility of AUVs for fisheries acoustics.

Among many, automatic vision-guided station keeping, localization and navigation, photo-mosaicking and 3 -D mapping comprise application areas of special interest. The core issue in realizing these capabilities is to know with high accuracy the motion and (or) position of the vehicle. Over the last decade, a small, but growing, group of research centers have committed an extensive effort in underwater vision activities. Methods based on various approaches in motion vision– e. g., correlation-based, feature-based, optical flow-based, or direct– are being developed and implemented in support of different applications on specialized platforms that may simultaneously utilize other sensors for positioning. This makes it somewhat difficult, for user groups unfamiliar with the methodologies or technologies, to evaluate the capabilities of these vision systems. The main motivation for this work was to carry out and report the results of experiments with various techniques for positioning and mosaicking, on the same data set.

Several cold vents characterized by seismic blank zones {{have been identified}} on the northern Cascadia margin near Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 889 / 890. The most prominent vent site (Bullseye vent) {{has been the subject}} of intense geophysical and geochemical studies, including two- and three-dimensional (2 D/ 3 D) seismic imaging, heat flow measurements, piston coring with measurements of sediment physical properties and pore-fluid geochemistry, seafloor video observation, and sampling with the <b>unmanned</b> <b>submersible</b> ROPOS. The main seismically derived constraining observations are: (1) blanking increases with seismic frequency, (2) at low frequencies, layers can be traced through the zones, (3) blank zones widen with depth, (4) blank zones are underlain by a bottom simulating reflector (BSR), and (5) no velocity anomalies were detected across the vents. Constraints from piston core and thermal probe analyses are: (1) massive hydrate was recovered just below the seafloor at Bullseye vent, and (2) chemical alteration of sediments was observed by reduced magnetic susceptibility, increased thermal conductivity, and an elevated sulfate/methane interface. Additional constraints are: (1) no thermal anomaly was observed, (2) widespread carbonates and active chemosynthetic communities were found, and (3) elevated levels of methane were detected in the water column above Bullseye vent. We present a model for the seismic blanking at Bullseye vent that honors the constraints from all observations. The cold vents represent channels or networks of filamentous fractures containing hydrate and/or free gas. Free gas can be present within the hydrate stability field only in fractures, which may be coated with hydrate that prevents the inflow of water. The overall concentration of hydrate or gas within the vent must be small, because there was no observable velocity anomaly. ...|$|R
