Coupled with depleting fossil fuel reserves and owners’ perceptions on their environmental impact, fossil fuel alternatives are being actively sought.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{efficacy}} and acceptability of existing psychological interventions for health anxiety (hypochondriasis) are limited. In the current study, the authors aimed {{to assess the}} impact of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) on health anxiety by comparing the impact of MBCT in addition to usual <b>services</b> (<b>unrestricted</b> <b>services)</b> with <b>unrestricted</b> <b>services</b> (US) alone. METHOD: The 74 participants were randomized to either MBCT in addition to US (n = 36) or US alone (n = 38). Participants were assessed prior to intervention (MBCT or US), immediately following the intervention, and 1 year postintervention. In addition to independent assessments of diagnostic status, standardized self-report measures and assessor ratings of severity and distress associated with the diagnosis of hypochondriasis were used. RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (N = 74), MBCT participants had significantly lower health anxiety than US participants, both immediately following the intervention (Cohen's d = 0. 48) and at 1 -year follow-up (d = 0. 48). The per-protocol (PP) analysis (n = 68) between groups effect size was d = 0. 49 at postintervention and d = 0. 62 at 1 -year follow-up. Mediational analysis showed that change in mindfulness mediated the group changes in health anxiety symptoms. Significantly fewer participants allocated to MBCT than to US met criteria for the diagnosis of hypochondriasis, both immediately following the intervention period (ITT 50. 0 % vs. 78. 9 %; PP 47. 1 % vs. 78. 4 %) and at 1 -year follow-up (ITT 36. 1 % vs. 76. 3 %; PP 28. 1 % vs. 75. 0 %).

40|$|Today, the BitTorrent Peer-to-Peer file-sharing {{network is}} one of the largest Internet applications—it generates massive traffic volumes, it is {{deployed}} in thousands of independent communities, and it serves millions of unique users worldwide. Despite a large number of empirical and theoretical studies, observing the state of the global BitTorrent network remains a grand challenge for the BitTorrent community. To address this challenge, in this work we introduce BT-World, an architecture for observing the global BitTorrent network without help from the ISPs. We design BTWorld around three main features specific to BitTorrent measurements. First, our architecture is able to find public trackers, that is, the BitTorrent components that offer <b>unrestricted</b> <b>service</b> to peers around the world. Second, by observing the state of these trackers, BTWorld obtains information about the performance, scalability, and reliability of BitTorrent. Third, BTWorld is designed to pre-process the large volumes of recorded data for later analysis. We demonstrate the viability of our architecture by deploying it in practice, to observe and analyze one week of operation of a large part of the global BitTorrent network–over 10 million swarms and tens of millions of concurrent users. We also show that BT-World can shed light on BitTorrent phenomena, such as the presence of spam trackers and giant swarms...|$|E
40|$|At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century the {{understanding}} of society was that the rights of the state to survive outweighed the rights of the individual. This communitarian understanding was reflected in military tactics such as the sacrifice of soldiers through the extensive use of trench warfare in the battle of the Somme in 1916. Over the past century there has been a shift in the understanding of society to the point where there is much more of a focus on the rights of individuals. Trench warfare tactics would be inconceivable for military commanders in 2016, where remote warfare tactics, such as the use of drones, are utilised in an attempt to reduce the number of casualties amongst soldiers. The justification for the duty to obey all orders has previously been that the rights of the state to survive outweigh the rights of individual soldiers. Given the shift in the understanding of society with regards to the importance of the individual vis-à-vis the rights of the state, the question this thesis examines, is “Does the Australian Defence Force (ADF) have a compelling justification for the duty to obey orders”? An examination of the “unlimited liability contract” is conducted in order to discern whether it is an outdated historical understanding of <b>unrestricted</b> <b>service</b> and the duty to obey orders in the ADF. After dismissing the position of Michael Walzer of soldiers as being mere servants of the state, a novel understanding of soldiers as supra civis, that is super citizens, who willingly take on the extra responsibilities of citizenship, is proposed. Further justifications given by the ADF in regards to the duty to obey orders are also examined. Five potential options for how the ADF may understand the duty to obey orders are also analysed. In order to gain a deeper understanding of these options the F- 111 deseal/reseal case study is examined in light of each of the five potential options.

40|$|The case of BRI is {{evidence}} that, in a deregulated policy environment, a government-owned agricultural development bank can (a) {{be transformed into}} a highly profitable, self-reliant financial intermediary, and (b) turn into a major microfinance provider, offering carefully crafted microsavings and microcredit products to low-income people at market rates of interest. Making good use of government seed money and a World Bank loan during an initial phase, it has now fully substituted savings deposits for external loans as its source of funds. With an outreach to 25. 1 million saving accounts and 2. 6 million borrowers (July 2000) through a network of 3, 700 village units operating as profit centers, BRI covers its costs from the interest rate margin and finances its expansion from its profits. With non-targeted loans from $ 5 to $ 5000 at rural market rates of interest and <b>unrestricted</b> deposit <b>services,</b> the BRI Microbanking Division has weathered the Asian financial crisis well, making BRI the only profitable government bank in Indonesia. Several lessons can be drawn from BRI's experience: – Financial sector policies work and are conducive to financial innovations – With attractive savings and credit products, appropriate staff incentives, and an effective system of internal regulation and supervision, rural microfinance can be profitable – The poor can save; rural financial institutions can mobilize their savings cost-effectively – If financial services are offered without a credit bias, demand for savings deposit services exceeds the demand for credit by a wide margin – Incentives for timely repayment work – Outreach of a financial institution to vast numbers of low-income people and financial selfsufficiency (including viability and self-reliance) are compatible – Average transaction costs can be lowered, and both the profitability of a financial institution and the volume of loanable funds can be increased by catering for both the poor and the non-poor with their demands for widely differing deposit and loan sizes Within a six-year period, 1984 - 90, BRI became a model case in Asia of the transformation of an ailing government-owned agricultural development bank into a viable and self-sufficient financial intermediary with ever-increasing financial resources and numbers of customers, competing successfully with an array of other local financial institutions. Further strength was added to BRI?s microfinance operations during the Asian financial crisis: When the Indonesian banking system collapsed, BRI?s Microbanking Division remained profitable, with profits amounting to $ 150 million in 1999. At the peak of the crisis, 6 - 8 / 1998, it attracted 1. 29 million new savers during that three-month period alone, while demand for credit, because of perceived uncertainties, stagnated. This has generated excess liquidity of US$ 1. 45 billion (July 2000) – a recurrent challenge during the 100 -year history of BRI and its predecessors. Since the onset of the Asian financial crisis, the division?s 12 -month loss ratio has been continually dropping to 1. 35 % (July 2000), substantially below its already low long-term loss ratio of 2. 1 % (1984 - 1999). Inspired by the success of BRI and some other institutions in the region, governments and donors may focus their resources on the transformation of agricultural development banks into viable, selfsustained microfinance intermediaries, instead of closing them down.

40|$|One of key NASA {{goals is}} to develop and {{integrate}} noise reduction technology to enable <b>unrestricted</b> air transportation <b>service</b> to all communities. One of the technical priorities of this activity has been to account for and reduce noise via propulsion/airframe interactions, identifying advanced concepts to be integrated with the airframe to mitigate these noise-producing mechanisms. An adaptive geometry chevron using embedded smart structures technology offers the possibility of maximizing engine performance while retaining and possibly enhancing the favorable noise characteristics of current designs. New high-temperature shape memory alloy (HTSMA) materials technology enables the devices to operate in both low-temperature (fan) and high-temperature (core) exhaust flows. Chevron-equipped engines have demonstrated reduced noise in testing and operational use. It is desirable to have the noise benefits of chevrons in takeoff/landing conditions, but have them deployed into a minimum drag position for cruise flight. The central feature of the innovation was building on rapidly maturing HTSMA technology to implement a next-generation aircraft noise mitigation system centered on adaptive chevron flow control surfaces. In general, SMA-actuated devices {{have the potential to}} enhance the demonstrated noise reduction effectiveness of chevron systems while eliminating the associated performance penalty. The use of structurally integrated smart devices will minimize the mechanical and subsystem complexity of this implementation. The central innovations of the effort entail the modification of prior chevron designs to include a small cut that relaxes structural stiffness without compromising the desired flow characteristics over the surface; the reorientation of SMA actuation devices to apply forces to deflect the chevron tip, exploiting this relaxed stiffness; and the use of high-temperature SMA (HTSMA) materials to enable operation in the demanding core chevron environment. The overall conclusion of these design studies was that the cut chevron concept is a critical enabling step in bringing the variable geometry core chevron within reach. The presence of the cut may be aerodynamically undesirable in some respects, but it is present only when the chevron is not immersed in the core jet exhaust. When deployed, the gap closes as the chevron tip enters the high-speed, high-temperature core stream. Aeroacoustic testing and flow visualization support the contention that this cut is inconsequential to chevron performance...|$|R
40|$|Our society {{increasingly}} {{depends on}} computing devices. Customers rely on laptops and mobile devices to access security sensitive {{applications such as}} online banking. Companies have to protect their trade secrets. And governments have to guard their country's critical infrastructure against espionage and sabotage. Security of computing devices in such use cases is paramount and various security measures have been developed that raise the bar significantly for attackers. However, vulnerabilities in such systems still exist and are frequently exploited successfully. A common pitfall is that software security takes a layered approach where privileged layers keep getting extended with new components over the system's lifetime. This results in a snowball effect {{on the size of}} these privileged levels and this in turn increases the likelihood of software vulnerabilities. As all applications running on the device rely on the integrity of these layers, increasing the size of their code base has a negative impact on security of the overall device. Many security measures have been proposed to automatically harden the most privileged software layer, but they all fail to provide strong security guarantees. In this thesis, we considered a different approach. We developed three security primitives that can be applied at most privilege levels. Unlike related approaches, this set of primitives is fixed. Software components can be added easily at any privilege level, but no additional primitives will be required. Moreover, these security primitives can provide provable security guarantees. The most important security primitive is a program-counter-based access control mechanism. By enforcing different access rights on physical memory depending in which code module the processor is executing, sensitive parts of an application can be strongly isolated. For instance, a cryptographic key can be isolated to a protected module implementing a certificate-signing service. Since the key cannot be accessed by any other code than the module's, it cannot be stolen even if malware was already present on the platform. The access control mechanism also guarantees that the module is only accessible through the interface that it exposes explicitly. Second, we enable protected modules to limit which protected modules can access their <b>services.</b> <b>Unrestricted</b> access to modules may still allow a large range of attacks. While an attacker may {{no longer be able to}} access a well-isolated cryptographic key, for example, the exposed interface may still allow her to sign forged certificates. We prevent such attacks using a capability-based access control mechanism; a module can only be accessed if the caller ever received the capability to do so. Third, we propose a fast and practical state-continuity system. Using cryptographic properties, protected modules can use many services of the unprotected, legacy system while providing strong security guarantees. Unfortunately, these security guarantees only are ensured while the system is up and running. In practice systems crash, loose power or need to reboot. Integrity and confidentiality protecting the module's state before it is stored on disk is insufficient in such cases. Care must be taken that an attacker cannot present a stale state of a protected module as being fresh. Practical implementations are hindered by the substantial economical costs to add non-volatile storage to the processor. Many computing devices are already shipped with access-controlled non-volatile storage off-chip, but this memory is slow, very limited in size and wears out quickly. We propose an algorithm based on a simple hardware component to avoid all these shortcomings. During this dissertation we also focused on how these newly-added security primitives can be applied to provide strong security guarantees. A fully-abstract compilation scheme was developed that ensures that software-level abstractions provided to programmers cannot be broken; for every low-level attack, there also exists an attack at source-code level. This significantly simplifies reasoning about the security guarantees that protected modules provide and increases security of the overall system. status: publishe...|$|R
