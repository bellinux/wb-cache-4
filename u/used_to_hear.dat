5|$|Ranulf often {{worked in}} concert with Haimo the dapifer, or seneschal, and Urse d'Abetot in {{carrying}} out royal judgements. On one occasion, they, along with Robert Bloet the Bishop of Lincoln, reassessed the lands of Thorney Abbey for taxes. On another occasion, they were ordered along with Ralph de Luffa Bishop of Chichester {{to see that the}} abbey of Fecamp received custody of a church at Steyning. Others who often worked with Ranulf were Robert FitzHaimo, Roger Bigod, and Eudo the dapifer. These men are sometimes considered by historians to be the first Barons of the Exchequer. There are also signs during Ranulf's administration of resident justices in the counties who held courts for the king. Itinerant justices were probably also <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> pleas that were reserved to the crown.|$|E
25|$|When Augustus died in 14 AD, the Principate legally ended. While Augustus had granted Tiberius {{the legal}} {{standing}} {{that he needed}} in order to become Princeps (i.e., Roman Emperor), Augustus could not legally make Tiberius Princeps. However, Tiberius' legal powers, as well as his status as the chosen heir of Augustus, gave him an opportunity that his ambition could not refuse. Tiberius knew that if he secured the support of the army, the rest of the government would soon follow. Therefore, Tiberius assumed command of the Praetorian Guard, and used his Proconsular imperium to force the armies to swear allegiance to him. As soon as this occurred, the senate and the magistrates acquiesced. Tiberius' efforts were so successful, that when the senate declared him Princeps, he made his acceptance appear to be a concession {{to the demands of the}} senators. Under Tiberius, the power to elect magistrates was transferred from the assemblies to the senate. Now, the assemblies were only <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the results of magisterial elections. In addition, they did retain some theoretical legislative powers. When Tiberius died, Caligula was proclaimed emperor by the senate. Caligula transferred the electoral powers back to the assemblies, but then quickly returned those powers to the senate. In 41 Caligula was assassinated, and for two days following his assassination, the senate debated the merits of restoring the republic. Due to the demands of the army, however, Claudius was ultimately declared emperor. Claudius' antiquarian interests resulted in his attempts to revive the old Censorship, and to return some degree of independence back to the senate. Ultimately, Claudius was killed, and Nero was declared emperor.|$|E

5000|$|Buck is {{generally}} regarded as [...] "one of the most heavily criticized" [...] announcers in sports, with various fans complaining that he is biased on his calls towards or against particular teams. Buck attributes this {{to the fact that}} most fan bases, especially Major League Baseball fans, are <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> local announcers and not those working national broadcasts: [...] "Fans are <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> their hometown guys.

500|$|Only {{vertebrate}} {{animals have}} ears, though many invertebrates detect sound using {{other kinds of}} sense organs. In insects, tympanal organs are <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> distant sounds. They are located either on the head or elsewhere, depending on the insect family. The tympanal organs of some insects are extremely sensitive, offering acute hearing beyond that of most other animals. The female cricket fly Ormia ochracea has tympanal organs {{on each side of}} her abdomen. They are connected by a thin bridge of exoskeleton and they function like a tiny pair of eardrums, but, because they are linked, they provide acute directional information. The fly uses her [...] "ears" [...] to detect the call of her host, a male cricket. Depending on where the song of the cricket is coming from, the fly's hearing organs will reverberate at slightly different frequencies. This difference may be as little as 50billionths of a second, but it is enough to allow the fly to home in directly on a singing male cricket and parasitise it.|$|E
500|$|Thau explained, [...] "I {{worked on}} Ladyhawke and that's how I really met Dick [...] and Tom Mankiewicz. I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> those {{wonderful}} {{stories in the}} cutting room that Tom and Dick and Stuart would tell about Superman and that's how I kind of got the ideas for the plots of 'Taking Flight' and 'Making Superman'". Donner commented, [...] "There are a few shots where Chris 's costume looked green. We went in and cleaned that up, bringing the color {{back to where it}} should be." [...] Thau wanted to make the film shorter: [...] "I wanted to take out the damn poem where Lois is reciting a poem [...] when they're flying around. I also wanted to take out a lot of that car chase where it was just generic action… It was like a two-minute car chase. But Dick didn't want to take [...] out [...] the poem." [...] It was followed by a box set release in the same month, containing [...] "bare bones" [...] editions of Superman II, Superman III, and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. In November 2006, a four-disc special edition was released, followed by an HD DVD release and Blu-ray. Also available (with other films) is the nine-disc [...] "Christopher Reeve Superman Collection" [...] and the 14-disc [...] "Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition." ...|$|E
500|$|There was {{a strong}} {{reaction}} from the show's viewers. Adler said, [...] "I've heard {{from a lot of}} fans how important this character is for them because it's important to watch the internal struggle, the confusion and the torture one person can put themselves through being closeted." [...] He wants Karofsky to [...] "accept himself and come out because [...] it would be a beacon of hope for everyone else who's struggling", and noted, [...] "people do get hope from Glee." [...] He also said, [...] "I think [...] trusts me to do what I'm doing with the character, which is one heck of a compliment from him." [...] Murphy has indicated a preference for positive future developments, and said in early January 2011, [...] "This show is by nature optimistic and I think a character like Karofsky could turn to booze or pills or alcohol and kill themselves or do something dark. But I also love Max and I love that character and I sorta want that character to have a happy ending." [...] At one point in the bullying storyline, Karofsky threatens to kill Kurt, a scene that Adler characterized as [...] "very powerful. Chilling, terrifying, horrifying, yet, at the same time, heartbreaking. … Because there are kids who have messaged me since that episode saying they <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> that line spoken to them {{day in and day out}} at school", and they dreaded school because of it.|$|E

500|$|Rupert died in 1948, {{leaving a}} strong company to his {{daughter}} Bridget D'Oyly Carte. [...] She soon hired Frederic Lloyd as general manager. [...] Bridget and Lloyd also took steps to keep the productions fresh, engaging designers to redesign the costumes and scenery. [...] Peter Goffin, who had redesigned Yeomen (1939) and Ruddigore (1948) for the company, created new settings and costumes for Bridget for half a dozen more productions: The Mikado (1952; settings only, most of the celebrated Charles Ricketts costumes being retained), Patience (1957), The Gondoliers (1958), Trial by Jury (1959), H.M.S. Pinafore (1961; ladies' costumes) and Iolanthe (1961). [...] A new production of Princess Ida in 1954 was designed by James Wade. [...] Eleanor Evans, however, {{was an example of}} one of the company's stage directors (from 1949 to 1953) who was said to be reluctant to update and freshen stagings. In 1957, Goffin designed a unit set for the company to facilitate touring, reducing the number of vans required to carry the scenery from twenty to nine. [...] A 1957 review of Yeomen in The Times praised the production and marvelled at [...] "the continued vitality of the Savoy operas", noting: [...] "The opera remains enchanting; the singing seems, on the whole, better and more musical than that which one <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear,</b> say, 30 years since; and though the acting lacks some of the richly crusted performances of those days, it is perhaps none the worse for that". [...] In 1949, the company began a new series of recordings with Decca, featuring Green, who had returned to the company after the war, and continued the series with his successor, Peter Pratt. [...] The company cooperated with the production of the 1953 film The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan, which used some former members of the company in the cast. [...] In 1955, the company gave a seven-month tour to the U.S. to celebrate the 75th anniversary of its first American productions. [...] In 1959, the company began the tradition of holding a zany [...] "last night" [...] on the last evening of each London season.|$|E
