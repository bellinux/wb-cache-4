5|$|Battleships {{played a}} part in major engagements in Atlantic, Pacific and Mediterranean theaters; in the Atlantic, the Germans <b>used</b> <b>their</b> battleships as {{independent}} commerce raiders. However, clashes between battleships were of little strategic importance. The Battle of the Atlantic was fought between destroyers and submarines, and most of the decisive fleet clashes of the Pacific war were determined by aircraft carriers.|$|E

25|$|At {{once they}} invade the battleground {{and begin to}} wipe out the {{remainder}} of the Witch's forces. While some of the White Witch's army are trampled by the charging reinforcements, those that came with Aslan <b>use</b> <b>their</b> own ways of fighting: dwarves <b>use</b> <b>their</b> battle axes, dogs <b>use</b> <b>their</b> teeth, Rumblebuffin the giant uses his club (and steps on some of the enemy), centaurs <b>use</b> <b>their</b> swords, and unicorns <b>use</b> <b>their</b> horns. Then, Aslan kills the White Witch. When she is discovered dead, one-half of the surviving part of the White Witch's army surrenders and the other surviving half flees (they were later mentioned to have been exterminated sometime after the Pevensie Children's coronation).|$|R
5|$|Beginning in 1914, Harlow Shapley began {{a series}} of studies of {{globular}} clusters, published in about 40 scientific papers. He examined the RR Lyrae variables in the clusters (which he assumed were Cepheid variables) and <b>used</b> <b>their</b> period–luminosity relationship for distance estimates. Later, it was found that RR Lyrae variables are fainter than Cepheid variables, which caused Shapley to overestimate the distances of the clusters.|$|E
5|$|Filming started {{shortly before}} 7.00pm, and ended at around 8.30pm; Griffin left the {{building}} 10 minutes later.

5|$|Gignac {{and colleagues}} also noted, however, that bone {{puncture}} marks from Deinonychus are relatively rare, and unlike larger theropods with many known puncture marks like Tyrannosaurus, Deinonychus {{probably did not}} frequently bite through or eat bone. Instead, they probably <b>used</b> <b>their</b> high bite force in defense or prey capture, rather than feeding.|$|E
5|$|Great auks {{walked slowly}} and {{sometimes}} <b>used</b> <b>their</b> wings {{to help them}} traverse rough terrain. When they did run, it was awkwardly and with short steps in a straight line. They had few natural predators, mainly large marine mammals, such as the orca and white-tailed eagles. Polar bears preyed on nesting colonies of the great auk. Reportedly, this species had no innate fear of human beings, and their flightlessness and awkwardness on land compounded their vulnerability. Humans preyed upon them as food, for feathers, and as specimens for museums and private collections. Great auks reacted to noises, but were rarely frightened {{by the sight of}} something. They <b>used</b> <b>their</b> bills aggressively both in the dense nesting sites and when threatened or captured by humans. These birds are believed to have had a life span of approximately 20 to 25 years. During the winter, the great auk migrated south, either in pairs or in small groups, but never with the entire nesting colony.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, two {{prominent}} geologists, Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick (who first proposed {{the name of}} the Cambrian period), independently <b>used</b> <b>their</b> studies of the geology of Wales to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology. The next two periods of the Paleozoic era, the Ordovician and Silurian, were named after ancient Celtic tribes from this area based on Murchison's and Sedgwick's work.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{commonly}} hypothesized that Pachycephalosaurus and its relatives were the bipedal equivalents of bighorn sheep or musk oxen, where male individuals would ram each other headlong, {{and that they}} would horizontally straighten their head, neck, and body in order to transmit stress during ramming.
