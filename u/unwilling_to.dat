5|$|One {{probable}} {{reason for}} the British clergy's refusal {{to cooperate with the}} Gregorian missionaries was the ongoing conflict between the natives and the Anglo-Saxons, who still were encroaching upon British lands {{at the time of the}} mission. The British were <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> preach to the invaders of their country, and the invaders saw the natives as second-class citizens, and would have been <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> listen to any conversion efforts. There was also a political dimension, as the missionaries could be seen as agents of the invaders; because Augustine was protected by Æthelberht, submitting to Augustine would have been seen as submitting to Æthelberht's authority, which the British bishops would have been <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|E
