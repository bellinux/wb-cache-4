In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or {{situations}} that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It gave <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.|$|E
500|$|The 3:39 song is in {{the folk}} music genre, and it is {{perceived}} as a sing-along sea chantey or drinking song. The lyrics to the song include lines such as [...] "Our heroes wear pinstripes/Pinstripes in blue/Give <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> feel like heroes, too." [...] The song makes references to Ernie Banks, Wrigley Field, and a specific reference to Banks' catch phrase of [...] "Let's play two!" [...] The refrain includes the phrase [...] "Someday we'll go all the way, Yeah, someday we'll go all the way," [...] which anticipates the day the Cubs win the World Series, gives the song its name.|$|E
500|$|Frise and Clark {{had grown}} {{concerned}} with the Stars treatment of its staff and made an agreement in 1946 to leave at the first opportunity. [...] Clark contacted John McConnell, publisher of the Montreal Standard, a newspaper with a smaller circulation than the Star that had earlier offered him a position. [...] McConnell offered the pair salaries similar to what they received at the Star, {{as well as the}} opportunity for Frise to have his strip syndicated in the United States, which would supplement his income. [...] When they handed in their resignations that Christmas Eve, Hindmarsh asked them, [...] "Aren't you going to give <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> bid?" [...] Frise told him, [...] "Mr Hindmarsh, you have nothing to bid with." [...] The last Birdseye Center episode ran on 1 February 1947.|$|E

500|$|Dave Kehr gave {{a largely}} {{negative}} review; [...] "The film betrays no human impulse {{higher than that}} of a ten-year-old boy trying to gross out his baby sister by dangling a dead worm in her face." [...] Ralph Novak of People complained [...] "The ads that say 'this film may be too intense for younger children' are fraudulent. No parent should allow a young child to see this traumatizing movie; it would be a cinematic form of child abuse. Even Harrison Ford is required to slap Quan and abuse Capshaw. There are no heroes connected with the film, only two villains; their names are Steven Spielberg and George Lucas." [...] The Observer described it as [...] "a thin, arch, graceless affair." [...] The Guardian summarized it as [...] "a two-hour series of none too carefully linked chase sequences ... {{sitting on the edge of}} your seat gives you a sore bum but also a numb brain." [...] Leonard Maltin gave the movie only 2 out of 4 stars, saying that the film is [...] "headache inducing" [...] and [...] "never gives <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> breathe", and chiding the gross-out' gags." ...|$|E
500|$|The Mets won the National League East by [...] {{games in}} 1986, but the Phillies {{were the only}} team to post a winning record against them, {{including}} winning 7 of 9 at Veterans Stadium. On September 12, up by 22 games, the Mets came to Philadelphia for a three game weekend series needing one win to clinch the division. The Mets brought champagne to Philadelphia. Before the series, Mets manager Davey Johnson told the Associated Press, [...] "It will be nice to clinch in Philadelphia. It gives <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> beat the only team in our way...I have a nice warm feeling about this." [...] He told The Philadelphia Inquirer: [...] "For the fans...it would be nicer to clinch at home. But for the safety...and the livelihood of the players...it's better {{to do it on}} the road." [...] In the series opener, Mike Schmidt hit a three-run homer, Phillies rookie Bruce Ruffin out pitched the Mets' Dwight Gooden, and the Phillies won, 6–3. The Phillies won the second game of the series, 6–5; visiting Mets fans became unruly and damaged seats in the upper deck. One Mets fan was arrested after hitting two Philadelphia police officers. The Phillies completed the sweep by beating the Mets, 6–0, behind a shutout from Kevin Gross, drove in two runs with a fourth-inning triple. The Mets would clinch the division at Shea Stadium on September 17. After the season, the Phils' Schmidt won the National League MVP Award, ahead of the Mets' Gary Carter and Keith Hernandez who finished third and fourth.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Writing for The Buffalo News, Alan Pergament rated the episode three stars out of five, describing it as [...] "moody" [...] but [...] "muddled and confusing". Pergament noted that [...] "the suspense of the premiere actually {{is enhanced by}} all the summer speculation about the future role of Gallagher", and felt that Morgan and Wong were [...] "trying to bring [...] "Millennium" [...] into [...] "X-File" [...] territory". The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a A−, finding that it allows the series to [...] " [...] a corner, from a serial killer show with stained-glass window overtones, to a show that revels in those overtones, a show that plays in age-old symbols with a decided taste of the weird". VanDerWerff also felt that a monologue delivered by O'Quinn {{was an example of}} Morgan and Wong's best writing, and that the actor's delivery was the key to keeping the scene serious in tone. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4.5 out of 5, noting that it [...] "starts Season 2 off in high style". Gibron found that the episode [...] "has a nice sense of internal adventure to it, giving <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> learn more about our main players while setting the groundwork for some certified surreality to come". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "The Beginning and the End" [...] two-and-a-half stars out of five. Shearman felt that the episode had [...] "an overwritten quality", citing the Polaroid Man's dialogue as the main example of this; he also believed that the development of Catherine Black as a character seemed poorly executed, with the character lacking enough depth to [...] "retain the audience's sympathies".|$|E

After a positive article in PC Week, the company was selling 1,000 machines per month. Michael Dell appeared in PC's Limited advertisements in national magazines, asking readers to [...] "give <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> show you what [...] can do". Dell's family went on to lend him $500,000 to fund {{the growth of the}} company, but the loans were repaid in 1986. In late 1986, the company began operations from an 82,000 square foot factory in North Austin.|$|E
2500|$|The IBM arc {{system is}} an {{excellent}} example of an intra-oceanic convergent margin (IOCM). [...] IOCMs are built on oceanic crust and contrast fundamentally with island arc built on continental crust, such as Japan or the Andes. [...] Because IOCM crust is thinner, denser, and more refractory than that beneath Andean-type margins, study of IOCM melts and fluids allows more confident assessment of mantle-to-crust fluxes and processes than is possible for Andean-type convergent margins. [...] Because IOCMs are far removed from continents they are not affected by the large volume of alluvial and glacial sediments. [...] The consequent thin sedimentary cover makes it much easier to study arc infrastructure and determine the mass and composition of subducted sediments. Active hydrothermal systems found on the submarine parts of IOCMs give <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> study how many of earth's important ore deposits formed.|$|E
2500|$|Xenopol's {{dispute with}} Eminescu was {{revisited}} in a 2002 book by critic Alexandru Dobrescu: Detractorii lui Eminescu ("Eminescu's Detractors", second edition 2006). Poet and Convorbiri Literare book critic Emilian Marcu notes: [...] " [...] {{are in fact}} intellectuals of great amplitude, who express opinions that are somewhat in contraction with those imposed officially. [...] book gives <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> rediscover [...] texts by authors who are at least honorable, over which, alas, the dust of oblivion has set. Their return into an intellectual circuit can only be beneficial {{for all those who}} truly wish {{to know more about the}} great Eminescu". Similarly, critic Bogdan Crețu notes that Dobrescu managed to overturn the [...] "poltroonish" [...] classification of Xenopol and others as [...] "detractors": [...] "the new anthology [...] an honest exercise in the reevaluation of an epoch that is much more nuanced and rich than the books of literary history or the dictionaries will have us know". Contrarily, other experts routinely list Xenopol as mainly an anti-Eminescian—his has an entry among the [...] "detractors of Eminescu" [...] in Săluc Horvat's dictionary of Eminescu exegetes (published in 2010).|$|E

2500|$|The film also {{received}} some mixed reactions from critics. Filmfare rated the film 4 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Guzaarish is unabashedly Sanjay Leela Bhansali. In a film where life {{itself is the}} villain everything is larger than life, no surprise there. The house is grand, the characters even more so, the laughter is magnificent, the pain operatic and the treatment {{of all of the}} above is colossal in a deafening, attention seeking way that leaves no room for subtext or imagination." [...] Writing for NDTV, Anupama Chopra rated the film 3 out of 5 and believed that the film would be effective if the writing was more organic and the emotions felt more authentic but Bhansali never gives <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> invest in these people. Reuters trashed the movie for its over the top performances and stated that the lead actor Hrithik Roshan is the only saving grace of the movie where [...] "everything else, like Aishwarya Rai's make-up, seems fake and loud, and puts you off. The emotions, the set design, the dialogues, Hrithik Roshan's beard are all out of this world, residing in some alien planet that only Bhansali inhabits." [...] The Hindu reviewer Sudhish Kamath gave a negative review to the movie and heaped praises on the lead actor Hrithik Roshan saying that [...] "Hrithik Roshan gives one of the best performances of his career as a man trapped in a wheelchair/bad film, desperately craving for freedom.." [...] As a bottomline he said that Guzaarish is [...] "Highly pretentious, boring film with leftover craving-for-your-sympathy melodrama from Black and unused sets from Saawariya". The Times of India, which gave a 4.5 rating, mentioned that [...] "Guzaarish is an unusual film in many respects".|$|E

Bowers and I went to Kaufman’s store to get the money and Van Triplett and Foster {{remained}} behind. We came back with the dust and I unrolled it and showed them the sack, and the old man {{said he did not know}} if that was gold, and Bowers said, ‘Open it and show it to him, as he don’t know gold dust when he sees it,’ but I did not open it, and [...] just about to roll it up again, when Foster grabbed it and handing it to the old man, said, “Git!” and I started to grab the old man when they held me and said if I made a noise it would not be well for me. I pulled away from them and started after the old man, but could not see him and then went across the street and asked a party where there was an officer: that I had been robbed of $3,000 by some men over there.|$|E
