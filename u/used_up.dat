5|$|A {{defining}} {{aspect of}} the series is the Personas, manifestations of a person's psyche. Many Personas <b>used</b> <b>up</b> to Persona 3 are inspired by Graeco-Roman mythology. In Persona 4 {{they are based on}} Japanese deities; Persona 5 uses characters inspired by popular fictional and historical outlaws. The summoning ritual for Personas in battle varies throughout the series: in early games, the party gains the ability to summon through a short ritual after playing a parlor game; in Persona 3, they fire a gun-like device called an Evoker at their head; in Persona 4, they summon their Personas using Tarot cards; in Persona 5, they are summoned through the characters' masks.|$|E
5|$|After mating sperm {{is stored}} in the spermathecae, organs of the female {{reproductive}} tract, and can be <b>used</b> <b>up</b> to two years later to fertilise several clutches of eggs. Each clutch averages 250 eggs and is housed in a round white silken egg sac. The redback spider has a widespread distribution in Australia, and inadvertent introductions have led to established colonies in including New Zealand, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Japan and in greenhouses in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians {{possess a}} pancreas, liver and gall bladder. The liver is usually large with two lobes. Its size is {{determined}} by its function as a glycogen and fat storage unit, and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or <b>used</b> <b>up.</b> Adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen (in internal structures called fat bodies), under the skin and, in some salamanders, in the tail.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of his}} {{contract}} with the Batavian Society, van Kinsbergen had to take photographs of Borobudur, which had just been cleaned and restored. However, {{when he went to}} photograph the Panataran Hindu temple complex in East Java in 1867, he ran out of chemicals. In his enthusiasm for photographing the many reliefs of the temple complex, he <b>used</b> <b>up</b> so many glass slides that he could not go to Borobudur as he had intended to. The Society was nervous about van Kinsbergen's delay, so they did not grant his request to supply new slides.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, the Mint {{tried to}} {{alleviate}} the breakage problem using {{a new version of}} the cent with a shallower relief. This attempt led to the major variety of the series, as coins of the revised version have smaller letters in the inscriptions than those struck earlier. The two varieties are about equally common, and were probably struck side by side for some period as the Mint <b>used</b> <b>up</b> older dies. Efforts to conserve dies were the probable cause of another variety, the 1858/7, as 1857-dated dies were overstruck to allow them to be used in the new year.|$|E
5|$|In combat, auto-aim {{can be used}} as {{assistance}} against enemies. Should {{the player}} take damage, their health meter can be fully regenerated through the use of health pick-ups. Body armour can be used to absorb gunshots and explosive damage, but is <b>used</b> <b>up</b> in the process. When health is entirely depleted, gameplay stops, and the player respawns at the nearest hospital while losing all weapons and armour and some of their money.|$|E

In pressurized water reactors, boric acid is added to the reactor coolant when the plant is shut down for refueling. It is then slowly filtered out over many months as fissile material is <b>used</b> <b>up</b> and the fuel becomes less reactive.|$|E
5|$|Like the French, the German air {{services}} used {{a variety}} of disruptive camouflage patterns until April 1917, when lozenge camouflage was introduced; it <b>used</b> <b>up</b> to five colors. German aircraft were however sometimes painted in deliberately conspicuous colors, like the bright red of Manfred von Richthofen's Albatros D.III, advertising the pilot's prowess to intimidate the enemy.|$|E
5|$|On the {{way back}} from Gascony, Henry met with Louis {{for the first time in}} an {{arrangement}} brokered by their wives, and the two kings became close friends.

5|$|On waking up, Daenerys Targaryen learns from Ser Jorah Mormont {{that her}} unborn son died, his life <b>used</b> <b>up</b> in Mirri's spell that saved {{the life of}} Khal Drogo. Drogo has fallen into a {{catatonic}} state, which leads most of his followers to abandon him. Daenerys accuses Mirri of tricking her by not revealing the real price of her magic, and Mirri reveals that she sought to avenge the destruction of her village and her people. Unable to bear her husband's condition, Daenerys smothers Drogo with a pillow, killing him.|$|E
5|$|Paint is {{the least}} {{effective}} measure, but forms a basis for other techniques. Military vehicles often become so dirty that pattern-painted camouflage is not visible, and although matt colours reduce shine, a wet vehicle can still be shiny, especially when viewed from above. Patterns are designed {{to make it more}} difficult to interpret shadows and shapes. The British Army adopted a disruptive scheme for vehicles operating in the stony desert of the North African Campaign and Greece, retrospectively known as the Caunter scheme. It <b>used</b> <b>up</b> to six colours applied with straight lines.|$|E

Grade HBN contains a boron oxide binder; it is usable up to 550–850°C in oxidizing atmosphere and up to 1600°C in vacuum, but due to the boron oxide content is sensitive to water. Grade HBR uses a calcium borate binder and is usable at 1600°C. Grades HBC and HBT contain no binder and can be <b>used</b> <b>up</b> to 3000°C.|$|E

5|$|The D magic system, {{in which}} wizards {{memorize}} spells that are <b>used</b> <b>up</b> once cast {{and must be}} re-memorized the next day, was heavily influenced by the Dying Earth stories and novels of Jack Vance. The original alignment system (which grouped all characters and creatures into 'Law', 'Neutrality' and 'Chaos') {{was derived from the}} novel Three Hearts and Three Lions by Poul Anderson. A troll described in this work influenced the D definition of that monster.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{cover system}} allows players to move between cover, to fire blindly, aim freely, and target a {{specific}} enemy. Individual body parts {{can also be}} targeted.

5|$|The {{total size}} of the Roman {{garrison}} in Scotland during the Flavian period of occupation {{is thought to have}} been some 25,000 troops, requiring 16–19,000 tons of grain per annum. In addition, the material to construct the forts was substantial, estimated at 1 million cubic feet (28,315m3) of timber during the 1st century. Ten tons of buried nails were discovered at the Inchtuthil site, which may have had a garrison of up to 6,000 men and which itself consumed 30linear kilometres of wood for the walls alone, which would have <b>used</b> <b>up</b> 100hectares (247acres) of forest.|$|E
5|$|WASP-13 has a {{mass that}} is 1.03 times {{the mass of}} the Sun and a radius that is 1.34 times the Sun's radius. Measurements of its lithium content suggest that the star has <b>used</b> <b>up</b> all of its helium and is now fusing lithium in the shell around its core. With this, its {{estimated}} age is 8.5 billion years, over twice the age of the Sun, but this age may vary to any point between 4.4 and 14 billion years in age because of the high uncertainty surrounding this aspect of the star's age.|$|E
