5|$|Reaction of uranium(VI) oxide with {{hydrogen}} {{results in}} <b>uranium</b> <b>dioxide,</b> {{which is similar}} in its properties with ThO2. This oxide is also basic and corresponds to the uranium hydroxide (U(OH)4).|$|E
5|$|Thorium fuels {{also result}} in a safer and better-performing reactor core because thorium dioxide has a higher melting point, higher thermal conductivity, lower {{coefficient}} of thermal expansion and is more stable chemically than the now-common fuel <b>uranium</b> <b>dioxide,</b> which can further oxidise to triuranium octoxide (U3O8).|$|E
5|$|When {{carbonate}} is added, uranium {{is converted}} {{to a series of}} carbonate complexes if the pH is increased. One effect of these reactions is increased solubility of uranium in the pH range 6 to 8, a fact that has a direct bearing on the long term stability of spent <b>uranium</b> <b>dioxide</b> nuclear fuels.|$|E
5000|$|The first oxyselenide to be {{crystallized}} was manganese oxyselenide in 1900. In 1910, oxyselenides containing phosphate {{were created}} by treating P2Se5 with metal hydroxides. [...] Uranium oxyselenide was formed next by treating H2Se with <b>uranium</b> <b>dioxides</b> at 1000 °C. This technique was also utilized in synthesizing oxyselenides of rare-earth elements in the mid-1900s. [...] Synthesis of oxyselenide compounds currently involves treating oxides with aluminum powder and selenium at high temperatures.|$|R
5000|$|Neptunium dioxide {{contributes}} to the α-decay of 241Am, reducing its usual half-life an untested but appreciable amount. The compound has an interestingly low specific heat capacity (900 K, compared with <b>uranium</b> <b>dioxide's</b> specific head capacity of 1400 K), an abnormality theorized to stem from its 5f electron count. Another unique trait of neptunium dioxide is its [...] "mysterious low-temperature ordered phase". Mentioned above, it references an abnormal level of order for an actinitde dioxide complex at low temperature. Further discussion of such topics could indicate useful physical trends in the actinides.|$|R
50|$|The main plant {{consisted}} of two 1,010 MW (thermal) Magnox reactors, which were natural <b>uranium,</b> carbon <b>dioxide</b> gas cooled, graphite moderated units. These supplied heat to eight boiler units, four associated with each reactor. The steam produced by the boilers was fed to two turbo-generators each rated at 325 MW, but which operated at a reduced capacity of 250 MW from 1969.|$|R
5|$|Uranium metal {{reacts with}} almost all {{non-metal}} elements (with {{the exception of}} the noble gases) and their compounds, with reactivity increasing with temperature. Hydrochloric and nitric acids dissolve uranium, but non-oxidizing acids other than hydrochloric acid attack the element very slowly. When finely divided, it can react with cold water; in air, uranium metal becomes coated with a dark layer of uranium oxide. Uranium in ores is extracted chemically and converted into <b>uranium</b> <b>dioxide</b> or other chemical forms usable in industry.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium oxide {{is useful}} for many {{applications}} that require the combined properties of an electrical insulator and an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, and a very high melting point. Beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in high-power transistors in radio frequency transmitters for telecommunications. Beryllium oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the thermal conductivity of <b>uranium</b> <b>dioxide</b> nuclear fuel pellets. Beryllium compounds were used in fluorescent lighting tubes, but this use was discontinued because of the disease berylliosis which developed in the workers who were making the tubes.|$|E
5|$|Mallinckrodt Incorporated in St. Louis, Missouri, {{took the}} raw ore and {{dissolved}} it in nitric acid to produce uranyl nitrate. Ether was then {{added in a}} liquid–liquid extraction process to separate the impurities from the uranyl nitrate. This was then heated to form uranium trioxide, which was reduced to highly pure <b>uranium</b> <b>dioxide.</b> By July 1942, Mallinckrodt was producing a ton of highly pure oxide a day, but turning this into uranium metal initially proved more difficult for contractors Westinghouse and Metal Hydrides. Production was too slow and quality was unacceptably low. A special branch of the Metallurgical Laboratory was established at Iowa State College in Ames, Iowa, under Frank Spedding to investigate alternatives. This {{became known as the}} Ames Project, and its Ames process became available in 1943.|$|E
50|$|The station {{contains}} the Paralana Hot Springs, which issue from rich veins of <b>uranium</b> ore. Carbon <b>dioxide,</b> nitrogen, radon and helium bubble forth continuously. Because the Springs contain {{small amounts of}} uranium and radon, staying near the Springs for a prolonged period constitutes a health hazard. Living {{on the floor of}} the Springs is an extremophile algal mat that survives the warm temperatures of 62 °C and high radioactivity. The Springs are listed on the South Australian Heritage Register as a designated place of geological significance.|$|R
40|$|Depleted <b>uranium</b> (DU) <b>dioxide</b> (DUO 2) {{particulate}} fills {{are being}} investigated {{for use in}} repository waste packages (WPs) containing spent nuclear fuel (SNF). The sand-like particles would fill all void spaces in the WP, including the cooling channels in the SNF. The particulate fill may improve repository performance by (a) maintaining chemically reducing conditions in the WP to preserve the long-term integrity of the SNF, (b) reducing water flow through the SNF and thus slow migration of radionuclides from the WP, (c) slowing radionuclide releases by adsorption of species from groundwater and filtration of colloids, and (d) minimizing the long-term potential for nuclear criticality in the repository. This DU application may potentially use half {{or more of the}} entire U. S. inventory of DU. A baseline scenario of expected fill behavior over geological time has been developed. The expected behavior has been compared to a WP without fill material. This model provides a starting point {{for the development of a}} detailed performance assessment model of WP performance and a basis for defining required experiments to understand system behavior. The model is described herein...|$|R
40|$|Recently, novel container-less laser heating {{experimental}} data {{have been published}} on the melting behaviour of pure PuO 2 and PuO 2 -rich compositions in the <b>uranium</b> dioxide-plutonium <b>dioxide</b> system. Such data showed that previous data obtained by more traditional furnace heating techniques were affected by extensive interaction between the sample and its containment. It is therefore paramount to check whether data so far used by nuclear engineers for the uranium-rich side of the pseudo-binary dioxide system can be confirmed or not. In the present work, new data are presented both in the UO 2 -rich part of the phase diagram, most interesting for the uranium-plutonium oxide based nuclear fuel safety, and in the PuO 2 side. The new results confirm earlier furnace heating data in the uranium-dioxide rich part of the phase diagram, and more recent laser-heating data in the plutonium-dioxide side of the system.

40|$|International audienceThe Discrete Element Method (DEM) {{is used to}} {{investigate}} the compaction of ceramic powders {{by focusing on the}} role of primary particle and aggregate sizes. Hard aggregates of primary particles are represented as a collection of spherical particles bonded together by solid necks, which may break during compaction. Numerical simulations are performed {{to investigate}} the effect aggregate microstructure both on compaction and on the green strength of the ceramic compact. Tensile green strength originates only from van der Waals adhesion, without any action of a binder. It is shown that in such conditions, the green strength is inversely proportional {{to the size of the}} primary particles. The size of aggregates also plays a role, with smaller aggregates leading to larger green strength. The results of the simulations are compared to experimental data obtained on <b>dioxide</b> <b>uranium</b> aggregated powders, confirming the particle size effect. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Taking into account that, especially at high temperature, oxygen chemistry {{has an effect on}} the reported phase boundary uncertainties, the current results should be projected in the ternary U–Pu–O system. This aspect has been extensively studied here by X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The current results suggest that uncertainty bands related to oxygen behaviour in the equilibria between condensed phases and gas should not significantly affect the qualitative trend of the current solid–liquid phase boundaries...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{implement}} a selection process based on DRAGON and DONJON simulations to identify interesting thorium fuel cycles driven by low-enriched <b>uranium</b> or DUPIC <b>dioxide</b> fuels for CANDU- 6 reactors. We also develop a fuel management optimization method {{based on the}} physics of discrete on-power refueling and the time-average approach to maximize the economical advantages of the candidates that have been pre-selected using a corrected infinite lattice model. Credible instantaneous states are also defined using a channel age model and simulated to quantify the hot spots amplitude and the departure from criticality with fixed reactivity devices. For the most promising fuels identified using coarse models, optimized 2 D cell and 3 D reactivity device supercell DRAGON models are then used to generate accurate reactor databases at low computational cost. The application of the selection process to different cycles demonstrates the efficiency of our procedure in identifying the most interesting fuel compositions and refueling options for a CANDU reactor. The results show that using our optimization method one can obtain fuels that achieve a high average exit burnup while respecting the reference cycle safety limits...|$|R

40|$|The first {{fast breeder}} reactors, {{constructed}} in the 1945 - 1960 time period, used metallic fuels composed of uranium, plutonium, or their alloys. They were chosen because most existing reactor operating experience had been obtained on metallic fuels and because they provided the highest breeding ratios. Difficulties in obtaining adequate dimensional stability in metallic fuel elements under conditions of high fuel burnup led in the 1960 s to the virtual worldwide choice of ceramic fuels. Although ceramic fuels provide lower breeding performance, this objective {{is no longer an}} important consideration in most national programs. Mixed <b>uranium</b> and plutonium <b>dioxide</b> became the ceramic fuel that has received the widest use. The more advanced ceramic fuels, mixed uranium and plutonium carbides and nitrides, continue under development. More recently, metal fuel elements of improved design have joined ceramic fuels in achieving goal burnups of 15 to 20 percent. Low-swelling fuel cladding alloys have also been continuously developed to deal with the unexpected problem of void formation in stainless steels subjected to fast neutron irradiation, a phenomenon first observed in the 1960 s...|$|R
40|$|During its {{lifetime}} in {{the core}} of a nuclear reactor, the fuel undergoes significant changes in its physical, chemical and morphological characteristics. In outer regions of the fuel pellets so called "high burn-up" or "rim" structure is formed. In this region UO 2 grains, with size about 10 μm in fresh dense fuel, are reorganized into a porous structure with grain size 0. 1 - 0. 3 μm and porosity fraction up to 20 %. The mechanical, thermal and fission product retention properties of the high burn-up structure have encouraged further interest and attempts to mimic this morphology in fresh fuel. The JRC-ITU has studied various techniques for synthesis of <b>uranium</b> and thorium <b>dioxide</b> in aqueous or nonaqueous media. Such nanoparticles can serve as starting material for production of material having similar characteristics as the high burn-up structure, as has been proved using Zr(Y) O 2 nanoparticles. Recently, efforts have been focused on the compaction of the nanoparticle powders. A spark plasma sintering device (SPS, FCT Systeme GmbH) has been commissioned in the JRC-ITU and tested using various nonradioactive materials. The present study is oriented on pressing and sintering of Hf(Y) O 2 and ZrO 2 into nanostructured pellets.
