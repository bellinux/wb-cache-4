40|$|To {{answer the}} question, which rhetorical {{strategies}} are most persuasive to <b>university</b> <b>graduates</b> regarding hiring and recruitment, I surveyed three classrooms with a questionnaire that gauged <b>university</b> <b>graduates</b> attraction to three {{different types of}} rhetorical strategies. The rhetoric came from three major businesses that recruit university graduates: College Works Painting, Peace Corps, and Hewlett Packard. Each one of these businesses uses {{a different type of}} strategy to recruit <b>university</b> <b>graduates.</b> College Works Painting uses an Experience Illusion strategy {{based on the premise that}} the company will help train <b>university</b> <b>graduates</b> to become managers and leaders in business. Peace Corps’ uses an Altruistic strategy that sells the idea that <b>university</b> <b>graduates</b> will have superhero-like jobs, helping others. Hewlett Packard’s rhetoric is classified, in my research, as being a Fun strategy, as they advertise fueling individual’s curiosity. I predicted that the Experience Illusion strategy would be most attractive to <b>university</b> <b>graduates,</b> but, I found, through my analysis of the survey data, that the Altruistic strategy is the most attractive strategy to <b>university</b> <b>graduates.</b> I realized, though, that my survey could be expanded upon to yield a more accurate representation of university graduates’ attraction if a new survey were created. If a survey with more options of the same rhetorical strategies, the Experience Illusion, Altruistic, and Fun concepts worded in different ways, was administered to <b>university</b> <b>graduates,</b> the perceived entrapment of succumbing to the rhetorical strategy would be less thus yielding more true and representative results...|$|R
