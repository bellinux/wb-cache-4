The film was shown at the 1949 Cannes Film Festival, although it was not entered into the competition.|$|E

5|$|During {{the evening}} of 19 November, a {{thunderstorm}} followed by a drenching downpour broke over the opposing armies. In a few hours every wadi in the foothills and on the plain was in flood. The black soil plain, hard and firm during summer, became in these winter conditions sticky and heavy for marching and almost impassable for wheeled vehicles. The temperature, which had been hot {{during the day and}} pleasant at night, dropped rapidly to become piercingly cold. The infantrymen had been marching light in their summer <b>uniform</b> <b>of</b> twill shorts and tunics. With only one blanket (and/or a Greatcoat), this gear gave little protection from the driving rain and bitter chill.|$|E
5|$|Maha Chakkraphat {{decided to}} leave the capital with his forces, to engage Tabinshwehti and test the Burmese strength. On this occasion, he mounted his chief war elephant. Accompanying him were his Chief Queen, Sri Suriyothai, and one of their young daughters, Princess Boromdhilok, the two riding {{together}} on a smaller war elephant. Both royal ladies were dressed in male military attire (helmet and armour), with the queen wearing the <b>uniform</b> <b>of</b> an Uparaja. Also accompanying their father on elephant mounts were two sons, the Uparaja and heir apparent, Prince Ramesuan, and his brother Prince Mahin.|$|E

Anderson {{announced}} a new <b>uniform</b> <b>of</b> the Fourth Degree to include a blue blazer with the emblem as a patch and on the buttons, a white shirt, a Fourth Degree tie, dark gray slacks and a beret with the emblem. According to some Catholic news sources, the new uniform is considered controversial by some of its members, drawing criticism for its attempt to make its members appear (at first glance) to be military veterans {{as opposed to a}} fraternal religious group.|$|E

5|$|Sato and Reed {{return to}} Enterprise with the sad news that Archer {{did not make}} it off the weapon. Ferried on an Aquatic ship, Enterprise then returns to Earth, but they are unable to contact Starfleet. Surprised, T'Pol orders Tucker and Ensign Mayweather to fly a shuttlepod down to San Francisco, where they are {{suddenly}} attacked by what seem to be P-51s. The final scene switches to a World War II German field-hospital. A doctor summons some SS officers to examine the unfamiliar <b>uniform</b> <b>of</b> a burns patient who was recently brought in. The patient is revealed as Archer. One of the SS personnel steps out of the shadows, revealing himself to be a gray-skinned alien.|$|E
5|$|The SDS wore {{either the}} 1940 pattern olive green <b>uniform</b> <b>of</b> the Royal Yugoslav Army, or the earlier Kingdom of Serbia pattern {{which was a}} green-grey {{in the case of}} officers, and a greyish-ochre colour for enlisted ranks. These were {{obtained}} from stores secured during the invasion. The Review of the Serbian State Guard (Glasnik Srpske Državne Straže) was the official gazette of the SDS, published from 1942 to the end of 1943. The journal was edited by Jonić, and contributors included Nedić and Milan Aćimović.|$|E
5|$|The {{dress code}} of the British headbangers {{reflected}} the newly found cohesion of the movement and recalled the look of 1960s rockers and American bikers. The common elements were long hair and jeans, black or white T-shirts with band logos and cover art and leather jackets or denim vests adorned with patches. Following the example of Judas Priest, elements of S fashion entered the metal wardrobe of the 1980s and it became typical to show off metallic studs and ornaments, or for metal musicians to wear spandex or leather trousers. Elements of militaria, such as bullet belts and insignia, were also introduced at this time. This style of dress quickly became the <b>uniform</b> <b>of</b> metalheads worldwide.|$|E

50|$|Aiguillettes {{are worn}} by honor guard {{personnel}}. A single silver aiguillette is worn on enlisted cut <b>uniforms</b> <b>of</b> minor detachments. A single gold aiguillette is worn on officer cut <b>uniforms</b> <b>of</b> minor detachments. A double gold aiguillette is worn on officer cut <b>uniforms</b> <b>of</b> major detachments. All personnel of major detachments wear officer cut uniforms. Also, dembels (demobilized soldiers) often decorate their uniforms with makeshift aiguillettes.|$|R
5|$|The first entity {{to use the}} Italian tricolour was the Cisalpine Republic in 1797, which supplanted Milan after Napoleon's victorious army crossed Italy in 1796. The colours {{chosen by}} the Cispadane Republic were red and white, which were the colours of the {{recently}} conquered flag of Milan; and green, which was the colour of the <b>uniform</b> <b>of</b> the Milanese civic guard. During this time, many small French-proxy republics of Jacobin inspiration supplanted the ancient absolute Italian states and almost all, with variants of colour, used flags characterised by three bands of equal size, clearly inspired by the French model of 1790.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{spent their}} {{first month of}} service drilling in Washington D.C. During this time they were barracked in the U.S. Treasury Building. On May 25, they marched to Alexandria, Virginia where they set up camp and remained {{for a month and}} a half. During this time, President Lincoln and his cabinet reviewed the regiment and dubbed them the “Steady Fifth” due to their performance during the review. While encamped in Alexandria, the unit received new uniforms consisting of dark blue coats and trousers—the Regular Army <b>uniform</b> <b>of</b> the time. The 5th Massachusetts was one of very few volunteer units to take the field in Regular Army uniforms and were frequently mistaken for Regular troops during the Bull Run campaign. On July 13, the 5th Massachusetts received orders to march for Centreville, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|To {{their right}} is the king's nephew, prince Józef Poniatowski (34), in the <b>uniform</b> <b>of</b> the light cavalry of the Duchy of Warsaw and riding a grey horse. The uniform is another {{instance}} of foreshadowing; Poniatowski became the commander-in-chief of the Duchy's army and {{died during the}} Battle of Leipzig. At {{the time of the}} passing of the Constitution, he was the commander of the Warsaw garrison, and is shown {{keeping an eye on the}} procession, with his soldiers lined up and guarding the street. To his right, partially obscured by Poniatowski's horse's head, is Stanisław Mokronowski (35), deputy, general, and future leader of the Kościuszko Uprising in Lithuania.|$|E

5|$|Until 1912, {{the strip}} (<b>uniform)</b> <b>of</b> the French team was white with two rings, one red and one blue. After {{the first game}} won by France against Scotland in 1911, France's captain Marcel Communeau asked that the team adopt the coq gaulois (Gallic rooster), {{historical}} emblem of France, as its symbol. The Gallic rooster was probably chosen partly because it is considered as a proud and combative animal that can be sometimes aggressive, although it had been used previously as a symbol by French teams – a former soccer player, Jean Rigal, wore a uniform with this emblem as early as May 1910. The badge was initially white and red, but was altered to a multicoloured, embroidered image after 1945, and has been golden since 1970.|$|E
5|$|In April 1917, {{with the}} support of Muirhead Bone and his own father, Nevinson was {{appointed}} an official war artist by the Department of Information. Wearing the <b>uniform</b> <b>of</b> a war correspondent, he visited the Western Front from 5 July to 4 August 1917, a period which included the start of the Battle of Passchendaele on 31 July. Nevinson was billeted with other visitors in the Château d'Harcourt, south of Caen. Although life at the Chateau allowed Nevinson to demonstrate his cocktail making skills to the other visitors, he soon transferred to the 4th Infantry Division near Arras. From there he moved widely along the Front, visiting forward observation posts and artillery batteries. He flew with the Royal Flying Corps and came under anti-aircraft fire. He spent a night in an observation balloon above the Somme. Making his way to a forward post one day he was pinned down by enemy fire for an hour. An unauthorised visit to the Ypres Salient earned Nevinson a reprimand and added to his reputation for recklessness.|$|E
5|$|On {{the upright}} collar of full generals, {{lieutenant}} generals, major generals, and brigadier generals three stars were stitched within a wreath, all embroidered in gold coloring. The center star was {{slightly larger than}} the other stars. It {{was not possible to}} know which grade of general an officer was by his collar insignia. However, major generals and lieutenant generals wore two rows of nine buttons in groups of three down the front of the overcoat, and brigadier generals wore two rows of eight buttons in groups of two. However, Confederate Army Regulations had no distinction between the general officer grades, and had only the insignia for brigadier generals recognized. At least three general officers did not wear the prescribed uniform: Robert E. Lee, who wore the <b>uniform</b> <b>of</b> a colonel, refusing to wear a general's insignia until the Confederate victory; Joseph L. Hogg, who died of a fever; and Benjamin McCulloch.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the more}} recent <b>uniforms</b> <b>of</b> the German Army and East German Army were field grey, as were some <b>uniforms</b> <b>of</b> the Swedish army. The Army of Chile wears field grey today.|$|R
2500|$|The olive {{color of}} the {{ceremonial}} and casual clothes of soldiers and officers of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation {{during the period from}} 1994 to 2010, which, although close in color, is still different from the khaki (which, strictly speaking, it is difficult to call green) everyday and field (As well as, parade for soldiers) <b>uniforms</b> <b>of</b> soldiers and officers of the USSR Armed Forces and field <b>uniforms</b> <b>of</b> soldiers and officers of the Russian Empire (after 1907). Since 2010, the olive color <b>of</b> <b>uniforms</b> and <b>uniforms</b> <b>of</b> soldiers and daily <b>uniforms</b> <b>of</b> officers of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation has acquired an even brighter green shade, so that the color differences have become even stronger..|$|R
50|$|The Reds and Brewers wore Negro Leagues throwbacks August 12. The Reds {{wore the}} <b>uniforms</b> <b>of</b> the Cincinnati Tigers (which were hand-me-downs from the Reds in the 1930s), and the Brewers wore the <b>uniforms</b> <b>of</b> the Milwaukee Bears.|$|R
