5|$|Cosmetics {{testing on}} animals is {{particularly}} controversial. Such tests, {{which are still}} conducted in the U.S., involve general toxicity, eye and skin irritancy, phototoxicity (toxicity triggered by <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light)</b> and mutagenicity.|$|E
5|$|Many {{animals have}} dark {{pigments}} such as melanin in their skin, eyes and fur {{to protect themselves}} against sunburn (damage to living tissues caused by <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light).</b>|$|E
5|$|Other {{identified}} triggers include local {{injury to}} the face, lips, eyes, or mouth; trauma; surgery; radiotherapy; and exposure to wind, <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light,</b> or sunlight.|$|E
40|$|<b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>lighting</b> is {{integral}} {{for the growth}} and maintenance of many reptile and amphibian species. But providing an adequate source of light can be challenging. Many disease processes seen by veterinarians are attributed to <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lighting</b> deficiencies. In mammals, disease due to excess <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lighting</b> has been noted, and some veterinarians feel {{this may be a}} potential issue in reptiles and amphibians...|$|R

5|$|The user {{could also}} switch between phototubes without {{removing}} the sample holder. A 1941 advertisement indicates that {{three types of}} phototubes were available, with maximum sensitivity to red, blue and <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light</b> ranges.|$|E
5|$|The yellow {{stingray}} exhibits biofluorescence, that is, when {{illuminated by}} blue or <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light,</b> it re-emits it as green, and appears differently than under white light illumination. Biofluorescence potentially assists intraspecific communication and camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Zinc oxide {{can be used}} in ointments, creams, and lotions {{to protect}} against sunburn and other damage to the skin caused by <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light</b> (see sunscreen). It is the {{broadest}} spectrum UVA and UVB absorber that is approved for use as a sunscreen by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and is completely photostable. When used as an ingredient in sunscreen, zinc oxide blocks both UVA (320–400nm) and UVB (280–320nm) rays of <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light.</b> Zinc oxide and the other most common physical sunscreen, titanium dioxide, are considered to be nonirritating, nonallergenic, and non-comedogenic. Zinc from zinc oxide is, however, slightly absorbed into the skin.|$|E
40|$|Radiation burns are {{uncommon}} {{and their}} etiologies are various. The <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lights</b> {{are also a}} source of radiation burns. We present a case of life-threatening radiation burn caused by long wave <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lights</b> (UV) at the solarium center. Up to now, despite its widespread use, fatal radiation burns caused by the indoor tanning device at the solarium center have not been reported. The circumstances of this injury and preventive measures are discussed...|$|R
25|$|Fluorescein dye solutions, {{typically}} 15% active, {{are commonly}} used {{as an aid to}} leak detection during hydrostatic testing of subsea oil and gas pipelines and other subsea infrastructure. Leaks can be detected by divers carrying <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1936, Julian Deryl Hart, a Duke surgeon {{introduced}} <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lights</b> in {{the operating}} rooms to kill airborne germs. In 1956, Duke surgeons {{were the first to}} use systemic hypothermia during cardiac surgery. This is now standard practice worldwide.|$|R
5|$|Boron-doped {{diamonds}} transmit light down to ~250nm {{and absorb}} some red and infrared light (hence the blue color); they may phosphoresce blue after exposure to shortwave <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light.</b> Apart from optical absorption, boron acceptors {{have been detected}} by electron paramagnetic resonance.|$|E
5|$|Laboratories use {{techniques}} such as spectroscopy, microscopy and luminescence under shortwave <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light</b> to determine a diamond's origin. They also use specially made instruments to aid them in the identification process. Two screening instruments are the DiamondSure and the DiamondView, both produced by the DTC and marketed by the GIA.|$|E
5|$|The final {{instrument}} was the HSP, {{designed and built}} at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. It was optimized for visible and <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light</b> observations of variable stars and other astronomical objects varying in brightness. It could take up to 100,000 measurements per second with a photometric accuracy of about 2% or better.|$|E
40|$|Apart {{from the}} special glasses used for the {{building}} pockets, {{almost all of the}} glasses are permeable against the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lights.</b> Therefore it is more practical and economical to provide protection against <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lights</b> via curtains in the fronts instead of special glasses. In this study; the ultraviolet protection fabrics of the 100 % cotton woven fabric, which is raw, bleached, dyed without being applied ultraviolet absorbent and dyed after being applied ultraviolet absorbent in different concentration. According to the results, it was determined that a prefect protection can be enabled indoors by using ultraviolet absorbent, and the results showed that the ultraviolet protection increases with increase in the concentration of ultraviolet absorbent in the samples...|$|R
50|$|Though not {{normally}} found for sale outside of its native range, {{like most other}} Sceloporus species, the Texas spiny lizard makes an ideal choice for a small pet lizard. They are hardy, adapt easily to captivity, and readily consume commercially available crickets, though they do require specialized <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lighting.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Parchment {{is usually}} {{positively}} identified by sight, sometimes {{with the assistance}} of a hand lens or microscope. Visible hair follicle pattern, veining, scars, bruises and sometimes fat deposits all help confirm the animal origin of the material. Additional <b>light</b> sources including <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lights,</b> can make these properties more easily identifiable.|$|R
5|$|The {{hydrocarbons}} {{are thought}} to form in Titan's upper atmosphere in reactions resulting from the breakup of methane by the Sun's <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light,</b> producing a thick orange smog. Titan spends 95% of its time within Saturn's magnetosphere, which may help shield it from the solar wind.|$|E
5|$|Ultraviolet {{astronomy}} employs ultraviolet wavelengths between approximately 100 and 3200Å (10 to 320nm). Light {{at those}} wavelengths are {{absorbed by the}} Earth's atmosphere, requiring observations at these wavelengths to be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space. Ultraviolet astronomy is best suited {{to the study of}} thermal radiation and spectral emission lines from hot blue stars (OB stars) that are very bright in this wave band. This includes the blue stars in other galaxies, which have been the targets of several ultraviolet surveys. Other objects commonly observed in <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light</b> include planetary nebulae, supernova remnants, and active galactic nuclei. However, as <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light</b> is easily absorbed by interstellar dust, an adjustment of ultraviolet measurements is necessary.|$|E
5|$|Another way enzyme {{malfunctions}} {{can cause}} disease comes from germline mutations in genes coding for DNA repair enzymes. Defects in these enzymes cause cancer because cells are {{less able to}} repair mutations in their genomes. This causes a slow accumulation of mutations and results {{in the development of}} cancers. An example of such a hereditary cancer syndrome is xeroderma pigmentosum, which causes the development of skin cancers in response to even minimal exposure to <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cymer is {{currently}} developing next-generation laser-produced plasma extreme <b>ultraviolet</b> (EUV) <b>light</b> sources.|$|R
5000|$|There {{can also}} be latent {{impressions}} not easily {{visible to the naked}} eye, on many different surfaces such as floor tiles, concrete or even carpet. Detection may require the use of additional specialized light sources such as portable <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lighting.</b> Recovery typically includes photography as well as lifting with [...] "gel" [...] or [...] "electrostatic" [...] dust lifters.|$|R
5000|$|Since then a large {{array of}} {{treatments}} using controlled light have been developed. Though the popular consumer understanding of [...] "light therapy" [...] {{is associated with}} treating seasonal affective disorder, circadian rhythm disorders and skin conditions like psoriasis, other applications {{include the use of}} low level laser, red <b>light,</b> near-infrared and <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lights</b> for pain management, hair growth, skin treatments, and accelerated wound healing.|$|R
5|$|In October 2016, astronomers {{reported}} that the very basic chemical ingredients of lifethe carbon-hydrogen molecule (CH•, or methylidyne radical), the carbon-hydrogen positive ion (CH+ cation) and the carbon ion (C+ cation)are the result, in large part, of <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light</b> from stars, rather than in other ways, such {{as the result of}} turbulent events related to supernovae and young stars, as thought earlier.|$|E
5|$|In biology, natural {{selection}} {{can cause the}} development of patterns in living things for several reasons, including camouflage, sexual selection, and different kinds of signalling, including mimicry and cleaning symbiosis. In plants, the shapes, colours, and patterns of insect-pollinated flowers like the lily have evolved to attract insects such as bees. Radial patterns of colours and stripes, some visible only in <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light</b> serve as nectar guides {{that can be seen}} at a distance.|$|E
5|$|The US Army {{had been}} {{managing}} {{a piece of}} equipment referred to as S-202, which combined four IR cameras, a display, and operator chains, an artificial illumination component (described as “covert – UV,” using <b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>light</b> to provide illumination), and a freeze display function. Under Project Night Life, the S-202 it was to be tested on a S-61 helicopter by early 1967. The project itself was being funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).|$|E
50|$|Shaun Caton is a British {{performance}} artist and painter, who has created over 280 live performances worldwide {{since the early}} 1980s. Often characterised by extreme duration (some performances have lasted 3 weeks) or brevity (some performances just 17 minutes), his works incorporate the installation of ancient and organic items, with the making of gigantic paintings, often illuminated by <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lighting.</b> These works strongly reflect prehistoric or apocalyptic imagery.|$|R

5|$|The mission {{added two}} new {{instruments}} to Hubble. The first instrument, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, {{is now the}} most sensitive ultraviolet spectrograph installed on the telescope. Its far-UV channel is 30 times more sensitive than previous instruments and the near-UV is twice as sensitive. The second instrument, the Wide Field Camera 3, is a panchromatic wide-field camera that can record {{a wide range of}} wavelengths, including infrared, visible, and <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light.</b> Atlantis also carried the Soft-Capture Mechanism, which was installed onto the telescope.|$|E
5|$|The {{orange and}} brown {{coloration}} {{in the clouds}} of Jupiter are caused by upwelling compounds that change color when {{they are exposed to}} <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light</b> from the Sun. The exact makeup remains uncertain, but the substances are thought to be phosphorus, sulfur or possibly hydrocarbons. These colorful compounds, known as chromophores, mix with the warmer, lower deck of clouds. The zones are formed when rising convection cells form crystallizing ammonia that masks out these lower clouds from view.|$|E
5|$|Above the troposphere, the {{atmosphere}} is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining {{the rate of change}} in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light</b> and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between {{the atmosphere}} and outer space.|$|E
