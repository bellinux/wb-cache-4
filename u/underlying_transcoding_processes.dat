40|$|To achieve {{portability}} {{between different}} kinds of encoding formats and network environments, heterogeneous video transcoding becomes a key technique for reducing the bitrate of a previously compressed video signal. A frame-skipping transcoder {{is often used to}} avoid an unacceptable picture quality when high transcoding ratio is required. Due to high computational complexity and quality degradation introduced by conventional frame-skipping transcoders, a DCT-based video frame-skipping transcoder has been proposed recently. However, the <b>transcoding</b> <b>process</b> of the motion compensated macroblocks in the DCT domain becomes the bottleneck since IDCT and DCT processes are required. In this paper, we propose a new architecture of the frame-skipping transcoder to reduce the computational complexity of motion compensated macroblocks in the frame-skipping process. The new architecture transcodes the dominant region of a motion compensated macroblock in the DCT domain by making use of the DCT coefficients of the incoming bistream and some pre-computed shift operators. By using a shifted version of the dominant vector, the re-encoding error introduced in the dominant region can be avoided. On the other hand, an adaptive transcoding architecture to transcode the boundary regions of MC marcoblocks and a way to perform error compensation are proposed. This architecture can further speed up the <b>transcoding</b> <b>process</b> of the motion compensated macroblocks. Half pixel accuracy related to our proposed frame skipping transcoder is also addressed. Experimental results show that, as compared to the conventional or DCT-based transocders, the new architecture is more robust to noise, gives rise to fewer requantization errors, and requires simple computational complexity.

On the other hand, Wyner–Ziv (WZ) video coding (a particular case of distributed video coding) is an innovative paradigm, which provides encoders with less complexity than decoders.

In this approach, a reutilization of the MVs to accelerate the time spent on the H. 263 ME was also made. However, H. 264 offers better performance than H. 263 in RD terms[21] and its inter prediction algorithm is also more complex than the one implemented in H. 263. Furthermore, the authors of[15, 20] failed to fully exploit the correlation between the WZ MV and the traditional ME and only used them to determine the starting centre of the H. 263 ME process. Moreover, the acceleration of the ME process was not measured numerically. Instead the authors showed a formula to approximate the time saved[15] which is useless for other researchers.|$|R

The major difficulties of transcoding a B-picture to a P-picture are that the incoming discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients of the B-frame are prediction errors arising from both forward and backward predictions, whilst the prediction errors in the DCT domain arising from the prediction using the previous frame alone are not available. The required new prediction errors need to be re-estimated in the pixel domain. This process involves highly complex computation and introduces re-encoding errors. We propose a new approach to convert a B-picture into a P-picture by making use of some properties of motion compensation in the DCT domain and the direct addition of DCT coefficients.
