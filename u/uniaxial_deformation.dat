It {{was found that the}} dependencies of polarization ratio on <b>uniaxial</b> <b>deformation</b> for bulk GaAs and GaAs/AlGaAs are different. Two observed lines in photoluminescence spectrum are induced by free electron recombination to energy sublevels of valence band corresponding to heavy and light holes. Those sublevels are splited due to the combination of size quantization and external pressure. The quantum splitting energy value was estimated. Also was shown a method, which allows to determine the energy splitting value of sublevels at room temperature and at comparatively low <b>uniaxial</b> <b>deformation,</b> when the other method for determining of the splitting becomes impossible...|$|E
