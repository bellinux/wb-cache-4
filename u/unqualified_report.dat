40|$|We {{consider}} {{the effect of}} auditor tenure {{on the level of}} managerial fraud and the extent of auditor qualification of reports. We consider two conflicting effects. As auditor tenure increases, the auditor's ability to detect fraud increases (the 'learning curve' effect), which reduces the manager's fraud-incentives. On the other hand, the auditor may become more sympathetic towards management (the 'loss of independence' effect), which may increase fraud incentives. In order to analyse these issues, we develop an auditing game in which the manager makes an unobservable decision whether or not to commit fraud. The auditor then decides whether to perform a basic or an extended audit. The level of audit affects the probability of fraud-detection. Following the outcome of the audit, the auditor then decides whether to issue a qualified or <b>unqualified</b> <b>report.</b> In equilibrium, the effect of auditor tenure on fraud and report qualification depends on whether the auditor's ability or the auditor's loss of independence dominates.

40|$|Background: The audit has {{not always}} been as it is today. The first law {{requiring}} auditing was legislated in the Companies Act 1895. Many events have taken place in the audit history; among them was the Krueger crash, which affected the auditing profession hard in Sweden. This led to new recommendations and laws that would save the profession. Because of the events in the past, there are many who question the audit profession and discussions have been held regarding the auditor's independence and objectivity. Nov. 1, 2010 abolished the audit requirement for certain companies. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe and analyze the role of the auditor - the independence and objectivity, by perusing the number of qualified / <b>unqualified</b> audit <b>reports,</b> before and after removal of the audit requirement. Methodology: To answer the study's purpose, a quantitative study was conducted in which 400 annual reports from Stockholm and 200 annual reports outside of Stockholm, has been selected to be examined, to see how the number of qualified / <b>unqualified</b> audit <b>reports</b> has changed during the years 2008 - 2011. Theoretical Framework: The theories that have been applied in the study are the auditor's role, Independence & Objectivity and Profession.

The identification of the underlying dimensions of the messages communicated by the <b>unqualified</b> audit <b>report,</b> part I of the questionnaire, resulted in the identification of five factors: (i) purpose of the audit, (2) auditor responsibilities, (3) financial statement reliability, (4) the entity future viability, and (5) the decision usefulness of financial statements. An expectation gap was found - particularly in relation to the responsibility factor. The purpose of an audit factor, however, suggested that the current standard audit report was a readable document which enhanced the credibility of the financial statements. Also, the current audit report appears to have been successful in clarifying the purpose of the audit. An audit expectation gap was seen to exist between auditor and non-audit groups concerning the extent of assurance given by auditors, the term `present fairly' and the extent of audit work performed. In relation to the future viability factor, the results indicate that an audit expectation gap exists over {{the question of whether the}} <b>unqualified</b> audit <b>report</b> communicates management efficiency and whether the audited financial statements are useful in monitoring the performance of the entity. Part II of the questionnaire related to the possible expansion of the contents of the audit report.

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{criticism and}} litigation against auditors has frequently {{been attributed to}} the existence of an expectations gap between the auditing profession and the public. An audit expectations gap is said to exist when there are differences in the beliefs of auditors and the public about the duties and responsibilities of auditors, and the meaning of messages conveyed by the audit report (Monroe & Woodliff, 1994). Researchers suggest that the gap is attributable to both unreasonable public expectations (the reasonableness gap) and inadequate auditor performance (the performance gap), whether due to deficient auditing standards (deficient standards gap) or substandard auditor performance (deficient performance gap) (Porter, 1993). Most prior studies have investigated the expectations gap phenomenon in a developed country context. This study extends the generalisability of prior studies by investigating whether a reasonableness expectations gap is evident in Sri Lanka -a developing country. In particular, the study determines whether significant differences can be observed between auditors and the other groups, with regards to the role, objectives, and limitations of an external audit, and the message(s) conveyed in the audit report. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka has asserted that an expectations gap does exist in Sri Lanka, and that unreasonable user expectations are primarily to blame. This study aims to provide evidence useful in assessing the validity of the claims of the Sri Lankan accounting profession. Further, the study investigates whether the extent of the reasonableness gap is influenced by level of audit sophistication (knowledge) amongst non-auditor subjects. A smaller reasonableness gap is expected to be associated with sophisticated groups (e. g., managers, accountants, bankers, lawyers) relative to less sophisticated groups (e. g., private shareholders and students). This study is not concerned with issues relating to the setting of audit regulations, adequacy of the standards or the performance of the audit profession, but with the communication and understanding of current regulations and the intended meaning of <b>unqualified</b> audit <b>report.</b> The data for the study are collected by means of a self-administered questionnaire, which comprised of semantic differential belief statements. The survey included auditors, students, bankers, lawyers and preparers of financial statements. The results confirmed the existence of an audit expectations gap in Sri Lanka and suggest that the degree of audit sophistication amongst non-auditors is associated with the degree of unreasonable audit expectations. The study found that differences in the perceptions of non auditors and auditors concerning the auditor's responsibilities for fraud detection and reporting; and the meaning of the <b>unqualified</b> audit <b>report,</b> were important determinants of the extent of the unreasonableness gap. Contributing somewhat less to the unreasonableness gap were differences in perceptions concerning the auditor's responsibility for maintaining accounting records and the view that an <b>unqualified</b> audit <b>report</b> assures that entity is being run efficiently...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{compliance}} with IFRS disclosure requirements in Malaysia. There are four objectives that this study attempts to achieve, namely: (1) to ascertain whether present regulatory enforcement is effective in curbing non-compliance with IFRS in Malaysia; (2) to determine whether corporate ownership structure, culture and corporate governance attributes have a significant influence {{on the extent of}} compliance with IFRS disclosure requirements; (3) to identify the factors of (non-) compliance with IFRS from the perceptions of preparers and auditors; and (4) to explore the reasons why an <b>unqualified</b> audit <b>report</b> was issued despite non-compliance with IFRS disclosure requirements. This study employs a mixed methods approach to achieve the stated objectives, where annual reports of 225 Malaysian listed companies are examined and interviews with regulators, preparers and auditors are conducted. The following findings are documented in this study. Although compliance with accounting standards is mandated by law, this study demonstrates that no Malaysian company has fully complied with IFRS disclosure requirements. Similarly, the companies examined still receive <b>unqualified</b> audit <b>reports</b> despite significant non-compliance with IFRS disclosure requirements. This study argues that merely mandating compliance with accounting standards by law does not result in full compliance with accounting standards if sufficient or stringent enforcement is not in place. The Malaysian economy is dominated by family-owned companies and government-owned companies; however, this study finds that there was not enough evidence to support the influence of these ownership types on the extent of compliance with mandatory disclosure requirements. Despite the importance of corporate governance mechanisms in enhancing financial reporting quality, this study finds that only board meeting, audit committee size and audit committee expertise are significantly associated with the extent of compliance with IFRS disclosure requirements. However, the association direction for audit committee expertise is puzzling, because the negative coefficient suggests that mandatory disclosure decreases with the presence of audit committee experts. This study also provides evidence that culture (ethnicity) has a significant influence on the extent of compliance with IFRS disclosure requirements. This study also contributes to the extant literature by documenting the factors of (non-) compliance with IFRS from the perceptions of preparers and auditors. These factors are the attitude of top management, problems with accounting standards, lack of enforcement, passive investors, materiality, accountants’ attitude, undeveloped capital markets and political excuse. These (non-) compliance factors in fact cannot be revealed by statistical analysis. This study finds that materiality and true and fair view are the two reasons suggested by interviewees that can explain why unqualified audit opinion was expressed despite non-compliance with IFRS. Nevertheless, this study argues that materiality and true and fair view override might also be used (or misused) as an excuse by auditors for not qualifying audit reports in the case of significant non-compliance with IFRS disclosure requirements, given the subjective and vague concept of both materiality and true and fair view...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical {{study of the}} degree to which audit reports provide information relevant to the evaluation of the companies` commercial risk. To this end, an experimental study has been conducted based on a survey of commercial risk analysts employed in Spanish companies. The results indicate that the type of audit <b>report</b> (<b>unqualified</b> or qualified) does have an influence on commercial decisions taken by risk analysts. In particular, there are differences between an unqualified and qualified audit report if we analyse the following decisions: when commercial risk analysts decide to begin commercial relationships with another company, when they evaluate the risk of the commercial operation, when they demand additional guarantees beyond the normal, and when they must decide the amount of commercial credit to grant to the possible client. On the other hand, the results have shown that the effect of the nature of the qualification differs depending on the decision to be taken by the commercial risk analysts...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a common}} agency model, we {{investigate}} {{the interactions of}} a utility maximizing auditor (the agent) with managers (who hire the agent for non-audit services) and shareholders (who hire the agent for conducting an audit) of the same firm. In a single period model, managerial discretion over consulting and other non-audit service fees can influence auditors to issue <b>unqualified</b> opinions on <b>reports</b> that are more favorable than warranted. Shareholders, represented by an audit committee, cannot recover truth-telling. Removing the current restriction on contingent audit fees allows audit committees to offset the incentives provided by management and instead provide the auditor incentives to accept only truthful reports. Extending the model to a multiperiod framework, the audit committee can motivate truth-telling by making retention decisions that are contingent on outcome. Auditors will consider the impact This paper addresses the independence problems that can arise when firms hire the same agent to provide audit and non-audit services. We model the relationship between management...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine empirically the {{organizational}} factors that are associated with the absence of fraud. Design/methodology/approach – Factor analysis using principal component extraction was first employed. Logistic regression was then performed to analyze the survey responses of 253 chief financial officers (CFOs) in Hong Kong. A total of 20 semi-structured interviews were also carried out with CFOs to supplement the research results. Findings – The results indicate that audit committee effectiveness, internal audit effectiveness, the tone at the top managerial level, and ethical guidelines and policies are positively associated with a lack of fraud within organizations. Neither auditors' prior success in fraud detection nor the type of auditor employed is an influential factor in the absence of fraud. These results are interesting and counter those of earlier studies conducted in the USA. Also contradicting prior research, the receipt of <b>unqualified</b> audit <b>reports</b> was not found to be significant in this study. Practical implications – The lack of significance for certain variables, and the counterintuitive nature of some of the results offers opportunities for further research. The results provide auditors with practical insights that will prove useful in the course of their work. Originality/value – This is the first empirical study of its nature to be conducted in Hong Kong, and its results will make an important contribution to the corporate governance and auditing literature, particularly that focused on the Asia-Pacific region. These results also have important implications for the accounting profession and for the corporate governance process within organizations.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} presence of earnings management trigger the level of issuance of qualified or modified audit opinion. The ultimate purpose {{of this research is}} to gain better understanding on the issuance level of qualified opinion and the reliability of audit opinion rendered by auditors in Indonesia. First, we estimated earnings management through cross-sectional modified Jones (Becker et al, 1998) model in our sample. Then, we performed a linear regression model (Johl et al, 2007) in order to analyze the relation between the earnings management measure and the independent and control variables influencing it. There are two hypotheses in this research. For the first hypothesis results, there is a negative relationship between (ABDA) and (QUAL). This surprisingly means when the company practices (EM) it does not necessarily mean they are likely to receive qualified opinion from their auditors. For the second hypothesis results, there is a positive relationship between (ABDA*AQ) and (QUAL). This means when the company practices (EM) and being audited by the Big 4 and industry specialist auditors, they are likely to render a qualified opinion. However, the results for both hypotheses are insignificant due to extremely low evidence of only 4. 76 % companies with qualified opinion. There is still low probability of issuance of audit qualification in Indonesia as indicated with only 4. 76 % of total 672 firm years from 2008 - 2010 receive audit qualification. We do not know whether the rest 95. 24 % (100 %- 4. 76 %) truly deserve a clean <b>unqualified</b> audit <b>report</b> or perhaps the auditors have failed to detect earnings management practices within these audited companies...|$|R
