50|$|His {{status as}} both a fashion icon and {{well-known}} football fan led him to be chosen to unveil <b>Umbro's</b> England away football jersey in 2010, the first singer ever to do so. He has also modeled for Gio-Goi and Deadly Sins.|$|R
5|$|The crest was {{altered in}} 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons – {{one at the}} top, with Animo et Fide, and one at the bottom with Stockport County F.C.. In addition, the {{football}} was again removed from the shield. The Stockport County Supporters' Co - Operative used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo. County's kit was supplied by local manufacturer <b>Umbro</b> who supplied all three of County's kit for the 2013–14 season, replacing Nike, thus making County the only senior club in the UK to wear the <b>Umbro</b> strip in the 2013–14 season. For {{the start of the}} 2014–15 season, County again changed their kit manufacturer, this time from <b>Umbro</b> to Spanish-based manufacturer Joma which supplied County with a new Home, Away and Third kit along with training wear.|$|E
5|$|The first kit {{manufacturer}} {{to appear on}} Sunderland kits was <b>Umbro,</b> between 1975–81. French brand Le Coq Sportif produced kits between 1981–83.

50|$|The Zempoaltépec vole (Microtus umbrosus) is {{a species}} of rodent in the family Cricetidae. The name Microtus is from the Greek word mikros meaning small and otus meaning ear. The name umbrosus could be from the Latin <b>umbros</b> meaning shady. It is rather large and has a long tail when {{compared}} with other voles. Its pelage is long and soft. In the upper parts, the hair is uniformly dusky with brown tips and the lower parts a dark grey thinly washed with a reddish yellow color. It is found only in Mexico, in a semi-isolated mountain range southeast of the Cajones River in Mixes district, in Oaxaca.|$|R
40|$|This case {{looks at}} {{the long history of}} racism on and off the {{football}} pitch. Although this case focuses on UK football, the issue does not exist solely within the UK – it is found in many countries and even threatens to disrupt the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The case highlights the poor attempts by clubs and by football (and other) authorities to stamp out racism. The examples demonstrate the lack of consistency in dealing with the problem and the apparent unwillingness of people at the top to deal with this issue. Perhaps business needs to be drawn into the furore to ensure action – hit racists where it hurts (and we are not talking footballs here). <b>Umbro’s</b> withdrawal of sponsorship of John Terry is a start; Zoopla’s withdrawal of their West Bromwich Albion shirt sponsorship another – let’s have some bigger action off the pitch...|$|R
