In July 1940 {{following}} the victory in France, the 227th Division performed occupation, security and coastal defense duties along the Normandy coast near Le Havre. Using his engineering and manufacturing skills and the men from his battalion, Becker mobilized a complete battery of self-propelled artillery, making use of the <b>under-carriages</b> of the Vickers Mk.6 to motorize twelve of the battalion's 105 mm leFH 16 howitzers, and six of the 150 mm sFH 13, along with twelve more munitions carrying versions of the Mk.6.|$|R

50|$|The {{designer}} of the aircraft was Giovanni Casiraghi, an experienced engineer who had previously worked in the US from 1927 to 1936. On {{the basis of his}} experience he designed a radically new aeroplane. The P.108 was an all-metal low wing bomber with a retractable <b>under-carriage.</b> During the Air Ministry official requirement of 1939, it won the Regia Aeronauticas contract for a new bomber over the CANT Z.1014 as it became obvious that the other competitors could not deliver useful numbers of aircraft to the Italian Royal Air Force before the mid-1940s.|$|E
50|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War, Henderson {{was one of the first}} two artists, {{alongside}} Paul Nash, appointed as a full-time salaried artist to the Air Ministry by the War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC. Henderson was sent to RAF bases in Scotland but was frustrated to find that William Rothenstein, although not contracted to WAAC at the time, had already visited many of the same bases and made many of the portrait drawings Henderson was due to paint. This led Henderson to concentrate on ground crew, aircraft hangars, repair shops and runways. Although the painting An Improvised Test of an <b>Under-carriage</b> provoked fury in the Air Ministry and contributed to Henderson's six-month contract not being extended, it was among the artworks shown at the first WAAC Britain at War exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in May 1941. The painting shows a man jumping up and down on the wing of a Lockheed Hudson to test the undercarriage.|$|E
50|$|The Aeronca high-wing formula used a {{welded steel}} tube {{fuselage}} covered with fabric, wooden wings covered with plywood and fabric braced by V-struts {{to the rear}} undercarriage attachment point on the lower fuselage. Tail surfaces were also built up with welded steel tubing covered with fabric. The fixed tail-wheel undercarriage, sprung with oleo struts and faired triangular side members hinged at the fuselage. A small tail-wheel on a spring steel leaf at the extreme rear of the fuselage completed the <b>under-carriage.</b> The engine is fitted conventionally in the nose and was either semi-cowled or fully cowled using sheet aluminium alloy, depending on model. Some civilian models had side-by-side seating in a well-glazed cabin under the wing centre-section, with entry through car style doors either side. A tandem seating arrangement was developed for training and military models with the rear seat mounted 9 in inches higher than the front to allow the instructor {{to use the same}} instruments as the trainee and improve forward view from the back seat. Tandem seat aircraft had extensively glazed cockpits to allow good all-round visibility.|$|E

40|$|Comfort within modern cars is {{becoming}} more and more important in the customer's decision to buy. Therefore car manufacturers make great efforts to improve the acoustic impression of the passengers' compartment and to reduce the structure-borne-noise transfer from disturbing sources like combustion engines or under-carriages. Typically, the taken measures are accompanied by a significant increase of the overall weight, even though they do not always reach the desired vibration- or acoustic level. Within this article, solutions based on smart structures will be explored. Smart structures have been used for a long time in aerospace applications. The investigated approach tries to integrate a so called "active interface" in-between the car chassis and the spring- and damping elements of the undercarriage. The idea is to reduce structure-borne-noise caused by the tire-road-contact. By controlling the behaviour of the structure-borne-noise transfer, it could be possible to enlarge the passengers comfort without changing the driving dynamics of the <b>under-carriage...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{approach}} to pragmatics explored {{in this article}} focuses on elements of social interaction which are of universal relevance, and which may provide bases for a comparative approach. The discussion is anchored by reference to a fragment of conversation from a video-recording of Lao speakers during a home visit in rural Laos. The following points are discussed. First, an understanding of the full richness of context is indispensable for a proper understanding of any interaction. Second, human relationships are a primary locus of social organization, and as such constitute a key focus for pragmatics. Third, human social intelligence forms a universal cognitive <b>under-carriage</b> for interaction, and requires careful cross-cultural study. Fourth, a neo-Peircean framework for a general understanding of semiotic processes gives us a way of stepping away from language as our basic analytical frame. It is argued that {{in order to get a}} grip on pragmatics across human groups, we need to take a comparative approach in the biological sense—i. e. with reference to other species as well. From this perspective, human pragmatics is about using semiotic resources to try to meet goals in the realm of social relationships...|$|E
40|$|Summary. [...] An {{investigation}} is made into {{the characteristics of}} a freely suspended flexible sheet as a shock absorber replacing the conventional <b>under-carriage,</b> particular attention being given to the inertia of the sheet. It is found that when an aircraft is dropped vertically on to the sheet the retarding force is first produced by the inertia of the sheet itself, and not until later in the descent by the reactions from the side supports of the sheet. By careful adjustments of the mass and tension of the sheet 'retardation efficiencies ' exceeding 80 per cent can be achieved. The effect of the aircraft having a forward component of velocity increases the contribution of sheet momentum. For reasonably practical laliding speeds and sheet dimensions, virtually the whole of the momentum of descent is absorbed by sheet inertia. Under such conditions still higher retardation efficiencies are obtainable and, with a J suitable design of aircraft keel, rebound may be entirely eliminated. 1. I~troductio~. [...] The successful landing of an aircraft depends on the vertical component of its velocity being reduced to zero within a limited vertical distance and without exceeding specified accelerations. For a given maximum acceleration the travel cannot be less than that which would occur if the acceleration were kept constant throughout the motion. The 'retardation efficiency ' of a particular system 1 is taken as the ratio of the minimum to the actua...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2009. In {{the history}} of {{aerodynamic}} research around the bluff bodies like SUV, trucks and trailers, {{it has always been}} observed that their shapes with square base have served as an obstacle improving vehicle fuel economy. When the air passes over the vehicle surface, it makes the air over the surface change its behavior, resulting in a low pressure region and a high pressure region. This pressure difference along with the vortex shedding causes drag thereby increases the fuel consumption. 	Researchers around the world have tried to reduce the drag of trailers or truck by using external devices like spoilers, vortex strake device (VCD) and <b>under-carriage</b> flow device (UFD). The purpose of this thesis is to check the feasibility of using such external devices for reducing drag on the large size SUV. The generic SUV model created by previous research experiments along with the Ahmed's reference model is considered as a benchmark for validating all the simulation results. 	Simple external devices like boat tail plate and the foot step are simulated and optimized using commercial software packages like FLUENT, GAMBIT, T-grid and Solidworks. Fifteen different angular combinations of upper and lower boat tail plates are simulated and optimized to get the best angle suitable for drag reduction of Generic SUV model. The second external device commonly known as the foot step is simulated with five configurations by varying the width of the foot step. The foot step bypasses the air around the rear wheel and thereby reduces drag coefficient of the complete SUV model compared to the original SUV model. The optimal sizes of the width favorable for the drag reduction are discussed in this thesis. Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E
