40|$|The {{large-scale}} {{integration of}} variable renewable energies (VRE) like Photovoltaics and wind power into the power system {{is crucial for}} the transition towards a sustainable electricity supply. However, due to the inherent characteristics of VRE, i. e. the site-specific, highly variable, and unreliable power generation, {{as well as their}} low variable generation costs, the large-scale deployment of VRE causes adequacy-, grid-related, and balancing-impacts for the residual system. These impacts and the related costs need to be considered for a concerted capacity expansion planning with VRE in order to identify cost-efficient and reliable transition pathways. Traditionally applied capacity expansion planning models have limitations to consider the value of energy at its time of the delivery of VRE and their impacts on the system due to the applied low system-operational detail. Hence, new planning methods are required to ensure a successful transition towards a sustainable electricity supply. This work enhances the REMix energy system modelling framework to allow for a concerted long-term capacity expansion planning with VRE. The outcome of this is the REMix-Capacity Expansion Model (REMix-CEM). The optimization model bridges the gap between traditional long-term capacity expansion planning and short-term power system operation models. This enables the model to consider the value and the impacts of a large-scale integration of VRE into the power system accurately within capacity expansion planning. This thesis describes the challenges of long-term capacity expansion planning with VRE and presents the developed model in detail. This includes a principle description of how REMix-CEM is typically applied by DLR for a science-based consultancy of planning authorities in developing and emerging countries. To demonstrate its capabilities, the flexible formulation of the model is used to investigate two important issues within a model-based long-term capacity expansion planning with VRE - the model foresight and the applied system-operational detail. Both issues can have a significant influence on results and computational effort of the model. These correlations are investigated within two case studies for a fictitious but representative power system of a developing country. Results of the first case study indicate that the type of model foresight (single-year myopic, multi-annual rolling horizon, or perfect foresight) has a strong influence when some of the input parameters change suddenly at one point of the planning time frame, while its influence is less pronounced when parameters changes rather continuously over the period of study. Only a large model foresight enables the model to anticipate future occurrences well in advance and to adopt its investment strategies accordingly. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the larger the model foresight the higher is the competitiveness of VRE and dispatchable RE, because their advantage to produce electricity at stable costs over the lifetime can be captured more precisely. However, it is also demonstrated that a larger model foresight means also a higher computational effort to solve the capacity expansion optimization problem. In addition, a large model foresight with perfect information over the planning time frame might not fully capture the decision frame-work of real-life decision makers. To keep computational effort manageable for long-term capacity expansion planning with VRE, investment decisions are typically based on a limited number of representative dispatch periods. These dispatch periods have the aim to represent the temporal variability of load and RE resources over the year as accurate as possible. Within the second case study it is shown that the average day method, which uses average values to assign values for RE resource availability to the utilized dispatch periods, is inappropriate for capacity expansion planning with VRE. The value of energy at its time of the delivery of VRE is modeled inaccurately and system flexibility requirements, caused by the integration of VRE, are underestimated systematically. The representative day method, which uses a sample of “real” historical days instead of average values, is significantly more suitable because extreme values are not averaged. This leads to a better approximation of VRE electricity generation, which allows a more accurate consideration of the value of energy at its time of the delivery of VRE and system flexibility requirements. System flexibility requirements can be captured within capacity expansion optimization especially by considering unit commitment constraints (UCCs) of thermal generators. However, this requires a large number of integer decision variables that describes the <b>unit</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>status.</b> This leads to high computational complexity. Hence, UCCs are typically neglected during capacity expansion optimization. Within the second case study it is however demonstrated that neglecting UCCs within capacity expansion planning with VRE leads to an overestimation of the competitiveness of VRE and an underestimation of the need for flexible generation and storage technologies. This work shows that by a linear relaxation for UCCs system flexibility restrictions can be captured accurately during long-term capacity expansion optimization with comparably low additional computational effort...|$|E

The proposed model overcomes the inaccuracy issues in the current configuration-based model while retaining its simple and flexible bidding framework of configuration-based models.

40|$|Abstract — The {{short-term}} <b>unit</b> <b>commitment</b> {{problem is}} traditionally solved as a single-objective optimization problem with system operation cost {{as the only}} objective. This paper presents multi-objectivization of the short-term <b>unit</b> <b>commitment</b> problem in uncertain environment by considering reliability as an additional objective along with the economic objective. The uncertainties occurring due to unit outage and load forecast error are incorporated using loss of load probability (LOLP) and expected unserved energy (EUE) reliability indices. The multi-objectivized <b>unit</b> <b>commitment</b> problem in uncertain environment is solved using our earlier proposed multi-objective evolutionary algorithm [1]. Simulations are performed on a test system of 26 thermal generating units and the results obtained are benchmarked against the study [2] where the <b>unit</b> <b>commitment</b> problem was solved as a reliability-constrained single-objective optimization problem. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed multi-objectivized approach can find solutions with considerably lower cost than those obtained in the benchmark.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the optimal <b>commitment</b> of {{generation}} <b>units</b> in an all-thermal, single or multiple area, power system. The problem, known as <b>unit</b> <b>commitment,</b> is a nonlinear mixed program typically with thousands of 0 - 1 integer variables and diverse constraints. An exact optimal solution to the problem is only possible via (explicit or implicit) enumeration, which requires a prohibitively long computation time for large problem instances. Two optimization approaches, Lagrangian relaxation and simulated annealing, are explored in this thesis for efficient and near-optimal <b>unit</b> <b>commitment.</b> Lagrangian relaxation combines the solution of the dual of the <b>unit</b> <b>commitment</b> problem with feasibility search to obtain primal feasible solutions. The feasibility search is necessary because a solution to the dual seldom solves the primal, and because little theory is available to bridge the optimal dual and primal solutions. In this thesis, several new feasibility search procedures to find a near-optimal primal feasible solution from the dual solution are developed and tested. These procedures are independent of the data constituting different problem instances, and are more rigorous and systematic than the existing ones. With these procedures, Lagrangian relaxation is successfully and efficiently applied to both single and multiple area <b>unit</b> <b>commitment.</b> Simulated annealing exploits the resemblance between a minimization process and the cooling of a molten metal. The method generates feasible solution points randomly and moves among these points following a strategy which leads to a global minimum in a statistical sense. Simulated annealing is very flexible for handling diverse and complicated constraints, such as those typical of the <b>unit</b> <b>commitment</b> problem. Simulated annealing is analyzed, evaluated and implemented for <b>unit</b> <b>commitment</b> in this thesis. Five major algorithms, proposed in this thesis for <b>unit</b> <b>commitment</b> and reserve-constrained economic dispatch, are extensively tested and compared by numerical simulation on sample power systems of 10 to 100 units. The simulation results show the efficiency of the tested algorithms for large-scale <b>unit</b> <b>commitment</b> and demonstrate the general applicability of simulated annealing. A comparison with the priority list method and a study of the convergence rates of the subgradient type algorithms are also included in the simulation...|$|R

40|$|A {{method of}} {{determining}} the dynamic operating cost benefits of energy storage systems for utility applications is presented. The production costing program DYNASTORE is used to analyze economic benefits for ``utility B,`` an isolated island utility, using heuristic <b>unit</b> <b>commitment</b> algorithms. The <b>unit</b> <b>commitment</b> is done using chronologic load data and a detailed model of the utility characteristics. Several <b>unit</b> <b>commitment</b> scenarios are run for utility B, {{and the results are}} presented. Comparisons between various Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) applications, as well as cases with and without battery storage, are shown. Results show that for utility B, a BESS of 300 MW size used for either load leveling or spinning reserve provides the greatest economic benefit...|$|R

The day-ahead load profile and electricity prices will alter after the demand response is introduced into <b>unit</b> <b>commitment</b> considering wind power. The calculated optimal results may cause unwanted load shedding and impact the interest of customers if the <b>unit</b> <b>commitment</b> does not consider the customer satisfaction. If customer {{satisfaction is}} ignored, customers may reject the demand response and then it is apt to fail to utilize wind power in a more economical way with the customers’ interaction. As is mentioned in [19], two customer satisfaction indices, consumption way index and payment index, are presented in this paper. In the proposed <b>unit</b> <b>commitment</b> model, the two indices are considered as constraints.|$|R

This method starts with a solu-tion having all available units online at all hours in the planning horizon and determines an optimal strategy for decommitting units one at a time. We show that the proposed method {{may be viewed as}} an approxi-mate implementation of the Lagrangian relaxation approach and that the number of iterations is bounded by the number of units. Numerical tests suggest that the proposed method is a reliable, efficient, and robust approach for solving the <b>unit</b> <b>commitment</b> problem. Key Words.

40|$|AbstractUnit {{commitment}} problem {{helps in}} deciding which electricity generation unit should be running in each period {{so as to}} satisfy a predictably varying demand for electricity. <b>Unit</b> <b>Commitment</b> enables uninterruptible power to be delivered to consumers using the principle of minimum operating cost. In this paper a laboratory prototype for <b>unit</b> <b>commitment</b> is developed using embedded systems. In this work, the <b>unit</b> <b>commitment</b> problem is solved using dynamic programming approach. The generators are switched ON and OFF on a priority basis to minimize the total operating cost of the generating units. An Embedded Development Kit(EDK) {{is used for the}} prototype which supports micro framework technology. The laboratory prototype is tested for various combinations of generating units...|$|R
