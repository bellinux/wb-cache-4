50|$|Until {{the opening}} of the Dungeness {{extension}} in 1928, New Romney was the terminus for trains from Hythe. The platforms were located in the area in front of the restaurant and model exhibition. The opening of the Dungeness extension required the construction of new platforms at a lower level, the original platforms being at road-level, and therefore inappropriate for accessing the road <b>under-bridge</b> by which the new Dungeness tracks passed under the adjacent main road. The current station was built in the 1930s, and retained the split-level organisation, with high-level terminating platforms, and low-level through platforms to Dungeness. When the railway re-opened after the second world war New Romney was again a temporary terminus, until the Dungeness extension had been repaired and reduced to a single-track operation. New Romney was the scene of the famous newsreel of Laurel and Hardy reopening the Dungeness line in 1947.|$|E
50|$|As {{the railway}} line passes {{from the middle}} of the town and as both the {{population}} and the number of vehicles are increasing, it really is a huge problem to go from one side of the crossing to another. Though there is an over-bridge which was built in 1995, people still face many problems because the bridge is quite far from the railway crossing. People clamor and tend to cross the railway line even when the gate is closed. An <b>under-bridge</b> was proposed in 2005 but it is not likely to start soon, so the elected Minister has proposed a small over-bridge. Many accidents have taken place on the railway crossing.In the year 2010, the citizens had to face a water scarcity problem for the first time in the history of town because of less rainfall and excess drainage of Amai Pond because of agricultural necessities.Another problem is there is no collectorate building.

Designed by Ross Barney Architects and built in 2005, it is nestled within the Riverwalk and {{consists}} of a terraced lawn, a waterfall and a central pool.The Chicago Vietnam Veterans' Memorial Plaza, {{one of the largest}} in the nation outside of Washington, D.C., connects people to the riverfront, provides an escape from the steel and glass of the City, and bejewels the City's waterfront. Its public objectives and finished forms embody what a memorial plaza should be; a remembrance of those that served, and a celebration of the living. The plaza occupies land, reclaimed by the rebuilding and relocation of Wacker Drive, to create an urban park, with terraces and bench-lined ramps that gently transition from busy city streets to more quiet spaces near the river, providing a green refuge. Plans were announced to deploy the full intention of a connected path from Lake Michigan west towards Lake Street. Ross Barney Architects was again charged with envisioning this extension. Phase 01 was completed in 2009 with <b>under-bridge</b> canopies and new landscaping added south of State Street.|$|E
50|$|It is memorable {{for coming}} after the Dee bridge {{disaster}} of 1847, when another cast iron bridge had failed. Cast iron {{should not have}} been used in this safety-critical application, and the design seems very strange, using cast iron where timber baulks would have sufficed. The bridge had been built in 1844, well before the Dee accident, and patched with the angle iron in 1853. The discovery of the cracked girder should have alerted engineers to the problem, and all should have been replaced entirely. Cast iron failures remained a problem for many years, culminating in the fall of the Tay Rail Bridge in December, 1879 with over 75 casualties in the passenger express passing over the viaduct at the time the cast iron columns collapsed. The problem did not end there, however, because so much cast iron had been used on the rail network. A cast iron <b>under-bridge</b> failed suddenly under a train during the Inverythan crash in 1882, killing 5 passengers on the train. The event which really focused minds occurred in 1891, when another girder failed under the Brighton express. Although no-one was killed, the furore caused by the Norwood Junction rail accident led to a survey of all under-bridges. Several thousand were eventually found, and ultimately strengthened or replaced.|$|E
5000|$|This type of roll {{is called}} a canopy roll because it is often used {{as a way for}} {{aircraft}} to quickly change positions, by rolling over the top of an airplane and coming down on the other side. Canopy rolls are often used in combat, to displace the attacker in relation to the defender's flightpath. An attacker following inside the defender's turn may need to displace the aircraft to the outside of the defender's turn in order to prevent an overshoot. Similarly, if following outside the turn of a defender that is much more maneuverable, the attacker may be unable to pull the nose up into a suitable firing position. By using a canopy roll, the attacker can shift the aircraft laterally away from the defender's flightpath. This will cause the flightpaths of both airplanes to cross, using geometry to change the attacker's aim. Canopy rolls are often used by the attacker when the defender reverses the turn, allowing the attacker to follow the reversal while keeping the correct relative position. The 1966 World War I-setting air combat film The Blue Max shows a canopy roll being performed by one of the pair of German Luftstreitkräfte pilots (the characters of Bruno Stachel and Willi von Klugermann), both flying Fokker Dr.I fighters, just before the tragic [...] "daredevil" [...] <b>under-bridge</b> flight sequence in the film.|$|E

50|$|Many {{industries}} were {{constrained by}} the lack of steel, being reliant on cast iron and wrought iron alone. Examples include railway structures such as bridges and tracks, where the treacherous nature of cast iron was keenly felt by many engineers and designers. There had been many accidents when cast iron beams collapsed suddenly, such as the Dee bridge disaster of May 1847, the Wooton bridge collapse and the Bull bridge accident of 1860. The problem recurred at the Tay Bridge disaster of 1879, and failures continued until all cast iron <b>under-bridges</b> were replaced by steel structures. Wrought iron structures were much more reliable with very few failures.|$|R
5000|$|The method adopted was {{to build}} all {{structures}} directly on to the land surface, and no form of preparation tunnelling was attempted. The work was slow {{due to lack of}} funds and the insistence of using convict labour, which meant that the labour force was constantly changing due to release or transfers to other prisons. In 1882 the work stopped for a re-think and once again restarted in 1886 when the decision was taken to delete from the plan one quarter of the design. This meant the loss of the Main Magazine (which was to have been in the western corner) and one quarter of this structure survived, much modified to become the above ground water tank. The well was also removed from the plan so the 4 inch water main had to be laid from Fort Horsted and the proposed <b>under-bridge</b> caponier was never even started. From 1886 to 1892, when the fort was finally completed, the ditch was dug and the spoil was used to cover the exposed buildings, some of which had been standing for over ten years, and to form the ramparts, the six very basic gun emplacements, two to each flank and a pair overlooking Luton Valley. Even so no armament is on record as ever having been issued to Fort Luton other than that brought in by units participating in the Annual Militia and Volunteer camps. The final act of engineering was the installation of the drawbridge in 1892 which is a rare type of rolling bridge and possibly the only one still left in the UK ...|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} road {{widening}} is rarely the suitable {{option for the}} already developed inner city. Expansion or upgrade for traffic facilities has predominately taken place skyward over pre-existing roads in a multi-layer scale. Flyovers, viaducts or overpasses, whilst all these vehicle bridges assist the arteries {{of the city in}} reducing traffic congestion, the tradeoff is the wasted space beneath. With the exception of small portion of spaces required at the abutments for the supporting piers to prop-up the bridge slabs, the majority of spaces beneath the traffic viaducts serve little purpose. <b>Under-bridge</b> space is the only available land in the city that does not appeal to developers. The government deems the best land use activity to be public spaces, such as parks, recreation, public toilet or with those smaller spaces, planted areas. However I see more potential in these spaces as useful resources that will not just mitigate the housing problem, but may also hold the key to transform the city into a future Utopia. In this thesis, I will demonstrate the significance of the housing shortage problem in Hong Kong, how is it affecting the people and the city, then give an example of how the ideal city may look like, how this may be achieved, and demonstrate what role the <b>under-bridge</b> spaces will pay in the shaping of the future city...|$|E
40|$|PublishedThree {{well-known}} examples-I- 35 W bridge failure, London Hammersmith Flyover closure, and the UK M 1 motorway <b>under-bridge</b> fire-highlight {{the need}} for a reliable decision support methodology to enable better informed decisions on timely intervention and/or resilient recovery from a damaging event. It seems that, quite apart from extreme man-made or natural hazards, our transportation infrastructure is not resilient under man-made or natural loads, and we need to leverage technology to better understand and respond to societal risks {{due to a lack of}} resiliency. The challenge to improve infrastructure resilience has led to major infrastructure research initiatives that are relevant to the case of bridges. FHWA created the Long Term Bridge Performance Program, while in the UK, EPSRC recently promoted the two themes of resilient infrastructure and monitoring and field investigation of existing infrastructure. The paper will describe these initiatives and how they aim to improve the resilience of bridges, which are key components in our transport infrastructure. It will also suggest some specific activities for developing closer interactions between a wide range of academic and industry stakeholders leading to development effective decision support methodologies. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers...|$|E

50|$|Together {{with the}} Wooton bridge {{collapse}} {{the following year}} in 1861, {{there should have been}} some concern within the railway companies about the number of cast iron girders used as <b>under-bridges</b> on railway lines. Engineers would also have been aware of the problems of cast iron in railway bridges after the failure of the Dee bridge in 1847. Whether or not such structures were inspected is unknown; it seems not, as several more collapses occurred some years later, at the Inverythan crash and the Norwood Junction rail accident in 1891. Thereafter, the vast majority of cast-iron underbridges on the rail network were eventually replaced by wrought iron or steel structures, although some cast-iron underbridges remain today, i.e. Robert Stephenson's High Level Bridge in Newcastle.|$|R
50|$|The line {{then passed}} through the Forest of Bere before heading across the water-meadows at Wickham on an {{embankment}}. The embankment crossed the River Meon itself, requiring the river to be taken through a long brick skew tunnel. The embankment also effectively divided the village of Wickham in two, with two new bridges providing {{the only means of}} crossing under the railway. This remains the case today. Just south of Wickham, the Meon was crossed again on a steel bridge supported on 6 tubular steel pillars - this was the second biggest bridge on the line after the West Meon Viaduct. The meandering course of the Meon, the constraints of the landscape and the railway's ruling gradient meant that the railway required 5 <b>under-bridges</b> within half a mile (1 kilometre)- 3 to cross the Meon (including the steel bridge near Wickham station) and the 2 to cross roads in Wickham.|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{building}} inspection of bridges, dams or large constructions {{in general is}} rather time consuming and often cost expensive due to traffic closures and the need of special heavy vehicles such as <b>under-bridge</b> inspection units or other large lifting platforms. In consideration that, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) will be more reliable and efficient as well as less expensive and simpler to operate. The utilisation of UAVs as an assisting tool in {{building inspection}}s is obviously. Furthermore, light-weight special sensors such as infrared and thermal cameras as well as laser scanner are available and predestined for usage on unmanned aircraft systems. Such a flexible low-cost system is realized in the ADFEX project {{with the goal of}} time-efficient object exploration, monitoring and damage detection. For this purpose, a fleet of UAVs, equipped with several sensors for navigation, obstacle avoidance and 3 D object-data acquisition, has been developed and constructed. This contribution deals with the potential of UAV-based data in building inspection. Therefore, an overview of the ADFEX project, sensor specifications and requirements of building inspections in general are given.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Bridge {{inspections}} {{are vital}} for monitoring {{the health and}} serviceability of transportation infrastructure throughout the world. However, inspections can be logistically-challenging, expensive, and dangerous. For example, inspections may require climbing, {{as well as the}} use of scaffolding, ladders, rescue boats, bucket trucks, and/or <b>under-bridge</b> inspection vehicles. Small, multirotor unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) offer a potential means of overcoming or alleviating some of these challenges. Among the primary benefits of UAS for inspections are the ability to maneuver adeptly in 3 D space, change view angles, and acquire high-resolution imagery, enabling the inspector to view (in real time and/or post-flight using post-processing enhancements, as needed) bridge elements in difficult-to-access locations, all while keeping both feet firmly on the ground. As transportation departments, inspection firms, and service providers increasingly recognize these potential benefits, interest in UAS for bridge inspections is growing rapidly. While a number of UAS bridge inspection projects have been documented in published reports and case studies, the rate of change of both UAS technology and associated regulations necessitates additional research and development, especially with regards to operational aspects of UAS bridge inspection. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop, test and document an end-to-end operational workflow for UAS bridge inspections, with a particular focus on regulatory and safety aspects. Since it is recognized that UAS are simply one tool for this particular application, another key focus on this study was on investigating which aspects of bridge inspection can and cannot be aided by UAS. As part of the study, three bridges in Oregon, representing different bridge types, conditions and locations, were inspected using small, multirotor UAS...|$|E
40|$|The optimistic {{limit of}} the colored Jones {{polynomial}} and the volume calculation JINSEOK CHO We discuss how to calculate the complex volume of a hyperbolic knot using the optimistic {{limit of the}} colored Jones polynomial. This method {{is based on the}} colored Jones version of Yokota theory. This is ajoint-work with Jun Murakami. Let K be a hyperbolic knot, vol(K) be the hyperbolic volume of K and cs (K) the Chern-Simons invariant of the knot complement S^ 3 K modulo π^ 2. We call vol(K) +i cs (K) the complex volume of K. The {{purpose of this article is}} to survey the method of calculating the complex volume using the optimistic limit of the colored Jones polynomial in [3]. Note that this method relies on Yokota’s theory of the optimistic limit of the Kashaev invariant in [11]. The calculation consists of the following four steps. 1 First step: drawing oriented (1, 1) tangle We fix a diagram D of K. We define sides of D as arcs connecting two adjacent crossing points. For example, Figure l(a) has 10 sides. Now we split a side of D open to make a (1, 1) -tangle diagram. (See Figure 1 (b).) We assume that the diagram satisfies Yokota’s Assumptions 1 - 6 in [11]. This roughly means the diagram has no crossing points that can be reduced trivially. We can always deform any knot diagram to satisfy these assumptions. Let the two open sides be I and J. Assume I and J are in an over-bridge and in an <b>under-bridge</b> respectively. Then extend I and J so that non-boundary endpoints of I and J become the first under-crossing point and the last over-crossing point respectively, as in Figure 1 (b). Assume the two non-boundary endpoints of I and J do not coincide. Yokota proved in [11] that we can always choose I and J with these conditions because, if not, the knot should be the trefoil knot, which is not hyperbolic. Finally, we remove I and J from the tangle diagram and put the result G. We always assume G is oriented by the direction from I to J...|$|E

50|$|Brunel {{also looked}} at novel track forms, and decided to use a {{continuously}} supported rail. Using longitudinal timbers under each rail, he achieved a smoother profile while not requiring such a strong rail section, and he used a shallow bridge rail for the purpose. The wider, flat foot also meant that the chair needed by the bullhead section could be dispensed with. The longitudinal timbers needed to be kept at the proper spacing to retain the gauge correctly, and Brunel achieved this by using timber transoms - transverse spacers - and iron tie-bars. The whole assembly {{was referred to as}} the baulk road - railwaymen usually call their track a road. Initially, Brunel had the track tied down to timber piles to prevent lateral movement and bounce, but he had overlooked the fact that the made ground, on which his track was supported between piles, would settle. The piles remained stable and the ground between them settled so that his track soon had an unpleasant undulation, and he had to have the piles severed, so that the track could settle more or less uniformly. A variant of the baulk road can still be seen today on many older <b>under-bridges</b> where no ballast was provided. The design varies considerably, but in many cases longitudinal timbers are supported directly on the cross-girders, with transoms and tiebars to retain the gauge, but of course with modern rails and base-plates or chairs. The longitudinal sleepers are somewhat similar to modern-day Ladder track.|$|R
