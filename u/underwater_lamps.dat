5000|$|After the war, {{work on the}} baths re-commenced, but was {{hampered}} by labour and materials shortages. Tobruk Memorial Baths finally {{opened to the public}} on 14 October 1950. They were opened officially on 26 November 1951 by Major-General WJ Windeyer, who was a senior officer at Tobruk. At the time, it was the only public memorial in Australia dedicated specifically to those who had participated in the Tobruk campaign. Inside the main entrance, the Townsville Sub-Branch of the Rats of Tobruk Association erected a marble plaque with the inscription:This memorial stone is dedicated to the sacred memory of fallen comrades who served with the Navy, Army, and Air Force during the memorial siege of Tobruk, Western Desert, Great War II, from April 9, 1941 to December 13, 1941. We shall remember them.Tobruk Memorial Baths were designed and constructed by the Townsville City Council's engineering and works departments, at a cost of approximately &pound;60,000. When completed, the baths comprised a standard 8 lane, 50 metres long Olympic pool, graduating in depth from 3 feet 6 inches to 10 feet, with the depths marked on the side, and a diving platform at the deep end; a toddlers' pool with depths ranging from a few inches to 2 feet 6 inches; dressing sheds with central courtyards to permit natural light and ventilation; a cafe; manager's accommodation; tubular metal grandstands with seating for 250 spectators, along the ocean side of the pool and above the service rooms at the northwestern end of the pool; concrete paving to three sides of the enclosure - the fourth, facing The Strand, was grassed; fencing; and gardens in front of the entrance pavilion, facing Anzac Memorial Park. Particular attention had been paid to lighting, with <b>underwater</b> <b>lamps</b> {{along the side of the}} pool, floodlights at either end of the pool which illuminated the length, and enclosure lighting. The main pool was tiled in blue and white, with the lanes demarked by black tiling, at a cost of &pound;6,000. Externally, the entrance pavilion was painted [...] "mist green", and internal walls were in [...] "harvest buff".|$|E
40|$|One of {{potential}} fishing grounds for small pelagic fish in Southeast Mallucas Regency is Rosenberg Strait waters. In this region, {{a study on}} the effect of different light intensities of floating lift net on fish catches was carried out. The analyses were done on light distribution of 4 light intensities different: Petromaks Lamp and <b>Underwater</b> <b>Lamps</b> of each 18 watt, 36 watt and 54 watt. This study showed that catches of floating lift net using different light intensities were statistically significantly different. The use of 36 watt and 54 watt underwater lamp yielded the same amount of catches but higher than that of 18 watt-underwater lamp and petromaks, both in number and species. Catches consisted of 17 species, 16 fishs and 1 mollusca. Number of species and size also varied with light intensity used. There were 13 fishs species dominated by Stolephorus indicus as much as 46. 9 kg or 22 % for petromaks catches, 14 fishs species dominated by Rastrelliger kanagurata as much as 64 kg (31 %) for 18 watt underwater lamp, 17 fishs species dominated by Rastrelliger kanagurata as much as 76 kg (28 %) for 36 watt underwater lamp, and 15 fishs species dominated by Stolephorus devisi as much as 54. 8 kg (22 %) for 54 watt underwater lamp, respectively. Based on the results, it is recommended that the use of light intensity in fishing operations of floating lift net should be 36 watt and 54 watt <b>underwater</b> <b>lamps,</b> due to high catches, both in number and species. Beside that, since light fishing has also caught illegal fish size, number of this fishing gear type should be controlled...|$|E
40|$|When simple {{strands of}} above and <b>underwater</b> <b>lamps</b> were placed along both banks of a canal 84 feet wide, {{statistically}} significant deflection was obtained in both clear and turbid water flowing at 6 {{feet per second}} average velocity. The effectiveness decreased as turbidity was increased. In relatively slow moving water, when the spectrophotometric transmission dropped to 55 % in 1 cm of water, guidance by high intensity light (repulsion) became ineffective. In this turbid water guidance by attraction with extremely low levels of illumination was effective. Approximately 80 % of the downstream migrant salmon and trout regardless of species or size, used the entrance compartment in which a. 015 foot candle light was burning. Dim lights placed below and downstream from the overfall pulled fish out of a stilling basin, while bright lights blocked them. Under dim illumination the downstream migrants swam over the falls with less hesitation than was displayed {{in the dark and}} the population pressure did not build up. Intensity, not color, seemed to be the important variable. Electrical and auditory stimuli were not effective guiding agents when used for repulsion or attraction...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} two 70 W <b>underwater</b> {{electric}} <b>lamps</b> on the catch rate {{of a commercial}} bottom otter trawl was determined by comparative trials both at night and in daylight. It was found that, although the overall numbers and weights of fish caught did not differ, most of the species which were caught in large enough numbers for a judgement to be made showed a reaction to light. Three species, Trachurus trachurus, Merlangius merlangus and Trisopterus minutus were attracted and four species, Eutriglagurnardus, Micromesistius poutassou, Merluccius merluccius and Limanda limanda were scared off by light. The possible use of lights to further the development of selective commercial bottom trawling by attracting or scaring particular species is discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|To each of five {{floating}} {{plastic bags}} 1500 halibut larvae were {{transferred from the}} hatchery one day after hatching. The plastic bags had a volume of 11. 5 m 3, a total depth of 5. 5 m and they were moored to floating collars. The bags were made of polyethylene coated with black PVC. Each bag {{was covered with a}} roof so the larvae were in a totally dark water column the first month. The general salinity was that of Atlantic water. Supplied water had a salinity of 30 - 32 o/oo. The halibut larvae reached the functional stage 40 days after hatching and natural zooplankton was added. At this time opening gradually was made in the roof of three of the bags while in two bags light was supplied by <b>underwater</b> <b>lamps.</b> Survival to the first feeding stage was about 45 %. Almost all functional larvae started to feed, and they reached a size of 20 mm at metamorphosis and bag termination 45 days after first feeding was observed. The dry weight had increased from 600 to 3500 ug in the period of active feeding. The mean overall survival was 3. 3 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{procedure}} is to gather visual and depth information and monitor underwater activities in the 105 -KW SFBWP and transfer channel. Profile lighting (the use of lighting and shadows to show the surface contour) {{will be used to}} assess the contour of the sludge surface. Select measurements will also be taken to determine the actual sludge depth. The control/video station will be setup outside the radiation area or in lowest possible exposure area to reduce personnel exposure (ALARA). This procedure is to provide a mechanism to assist in fully characterizing the volume and surface topology of the sludge currently deposited in the sandfilter backwash pit (SFBWP). Surveillance Systems Engineering (SSE) personnel will gather visual information utilizing a closed circuit television (CCTV) color camera, mounted to stainless steel extension poles. Connections allow the camera to be connected with a pan and tilt to allow better positioning capabilities and to get good landscape profiling of the sediment surface. The information will be videotaped to a one-half inch NTSC or Y/C format. Underwater lighting will be accomplished by means of 500 watt <b>underwater</b> <b>lamps...</b>|$|E
40|$|Fishing {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in Kotabaru of Indonesia to determine catching efficiency of double-twisted and triple-twisted multifilament trammel nets. A total of 10 nets were constructed with the same dimension and inner-outer mesh sizes (40 -mm and 80 -mm). Trials covered 160 -net hauls/type with 1 -hour submersion time. The shrimps were composed of Penaeus monodon, Penaeus merguensis, Metapenalis monoserus, Penaeus semiculatus and Parapenaeopsis sculptilis. A total of 142. 8 kg shrimp comprises 84. 46 kg (59. 15 %) for double-twisted and 58. 34 kg (40. 85 %) for triple-twisted were collected over 16 -daytrip sampling period, indicating double-twisted multifilament trammel net was 45 % more efficient. The average weight of double-twisted (5. 25 ± 1. 64 kg) was considerably {{higher than that of}} triple-twisted (3. 65 ± 1. 41 kg) as well as total YPUE of double-twisted (1. 056 ± 0. 02 kg) was considerably higher than that of triple-twisted (0. 729 ± 0. 02 kg) (P< 0. 05). Some recommendations for improving performances and efficiency of trammel nets are made, for example, by inserting the additional bag collector along {{the lower part of the}} nets, placing selvedge between the lead line and the net or using <b>underwater</b> <b>lamps</b> associated with the net...|$|E
40|$|Light {{emitting}} diodes (LED) are a {{new source}} for replacing traditional light sources including under water illumination. As traditional underwater light sources operate under a radiative transfer model, the luminous intensity is dispersed evenly at each emission angle, with the scattering factors included in the attenuation coefficient. By contrast, LED light sources are characterized by being highly directional, causing underwater luminous energy to vary with different emission angles. Thus, the traditional theory of underwater optical transfer becomes inapplicable when an underwater LED lighting module is designed. Therefore, to construct an underwater transfer model for LED light sources, this study employed the average cosine of the underwater light field, the method for light scattering probability, the LED {{luminous intensity distribution curve}} (LIDC) and axial luminous intensity. Afterwards, an <b>underwater</b> LED fish-attracting <b>lamp</b> was designed. Experimental results showed that, compared with the simulation values, the luminous intensity of the underwater LED lighting module at all emission angles had a percentage error of less than 10 %...|$|R
40|$|Bandung is a {{historical}} city which inherits many architectural heritages, including Gedung Sate as the office for West Java Governor. Development of Gedung Sate area are moving from widening the building’s wings, the Gazebo field, up to the Monument of West Java People’s Struggle; altogether in one axis toward Mount Tangkuban Parahu to become an urban icon in Bandung. As monumental buildings and landscape, proper lighting design concept is {{required in order to}} support visual performance and comfort around the area during nighttime. In this research, field measurements were conducted to map the existing lighting condition around the axis of Gedung Sate - Monument of West Java People’s Struggle. Subjective opinions from people at the area were also submitted by questionnaires. These data were considered as input for designing the lighting concept. Some ideas applied to develop the most suitable lighting concept for the area are constructing the imaginary axis, by arranging lighting installment in a linear path from south to north. Light emmiting diodes (LED) will be used at most to achieve the needs for color effect, energy efficiency, as well as long lifetime. Some decorative road lamps and pathway lamps will use HIT type, while <b>underwater</b> <b>lamps</b> in pond area will use MR 16 type, combined with LED to get the desired effect of color changing. From questionnaires regarding the new lighting design concept, 95 % felt satisfy with the simulation result and 80 % agreed if the design is implemented at the site area...|$|E
