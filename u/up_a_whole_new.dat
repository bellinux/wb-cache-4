Each bit can only be a zero or a one, so if you know which bit is wrong, then it can be corrected. In a landmark paper published in 1950, he introduced a concept {{of the number of}} positions in which two code words differ, and therefore how many changes are required to transform one code word into another, which is today known as the Hamming distance. Hamming thereby created a family of mathematical error-correcting code, which are called Hamming codes.

Two major academic projects have looked at Ruskin and cultural tourism (investigating, for example, Ruskin's links with Thomas Cook); the other focuses on Ruskin and the theatre. The sociologist and media theorist, David Gauntlett, argues that Ruskin's notions of craft can be traced to today's online community at YouTube and throughout Web 2.0. Similarly, architectural theorist Lars Spuybroek has argued that Ruskin's understanding of the Gothic as a combination of two types of variation, rough savageness and smooth changefulness, opens <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> way of thinking leading to digital and so-called parametric design.|$|E
25|$|Resistance: Fall of Man is a first-person shooter set in an {{alternate}} history. Many of its gameplay features stem from this, {{most notably the}} weapons. Some weapons are based on real weapons circa the 1950s, while some weapons are futuristically altered {{in accordance with the}} game's storyline. Insomniac Games has combined its passion for creating exotic weapons and vehicles, such as those found in the Ratchet and Clank series, with its proprietary development engine and physics system to create unique human and Chimeran weaponry. Each weapon provides a unique play style and strategy. An example of this is found with the Auger (Chimeran). The primary fire for this weapon is simple rapid fire, but the bullets burrow through walls, actually coming out stronger on the other side, opening <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> level of strategy. The secondary fire creates a barrier that is resistant to all bullets but its own. In addition to the usual short- and long-range weapons, the game features several different types of grenades, with both historical and futuristic varieties. For example, one grenade, known as the Backlash grenade, is capable of creating a dome-shaped barrier, where the player can enter for cover. The barrier reflects shots from opposing Chimera. Some weapons are not available on the first play-through of the game but can be found at certain locations on replaying the game.|$|E

500|$|The first Mega Man game—released in 1987—was not {{successful}} {{enough to justify}} the immediate development of a sequel. According to Roy Ozaki, director Akira Kitamura had {{wanted to make a}} sequel to Mega Man, but producer Tokuro Fujiwara was against it. Kitamura then went to Capcom Vice-President to get permission to make the game. [...] Capcom allowed the development team to create a sequel on the condition that they work concurrently on other projects as well. The staff spent their own time on the project to improve upon the original by adding more levels and weapons, as well as improving the graphics. The project supervisor of the first Mega Man invited Inafune to the sequel's development crew; Inafune was working on a separate game at the time. In the previous title, Inafune worked as an artist and character designer but became more involved in the production process of the sequel. [...] "Working on [...] marked my second year at this, and I even got to mentor a 'new kid', which opened <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> world of stress for me," [...] Inafune recounted.

40|$|Real time State Estimation is very {{important}} part of any SCADA based Energy Management System (EMS). In the SE, the measurement equations for bus voltage magnitude, real and reactive power, are all nonlinear and the solution must be based on iterative methods like Newton-Raphson method. For real time application, SE should able to execute repetitively at short intervals. However, the Power System is highly distributed in nature and includes large number of connected buses. The various measurements taken at each bus are then transferred to the centre station where the SE computations are done using the system parameter, measured data and network equations. one can make out two {{very important}} points at this stage. In-order to improve the performance of SE, in practice, the large power system is split in to sub-networks and each sub-network is managed by the local control station in coordination with the Centre station – “Two level SE” [1][2][3][8][9][12]. Even though it reduces the computational time, still it is not suitable for real time applications. To overcome the above difficulty and obtain a computationally inexpensive real time update of the state vector, tracking state estimation algorithms have been proposed and discussed in various research papers available in the literature [4][6][13]. Many techniques such as AI [16][17], Multi-level SE [11][20] and a few other [5][10][14][15][18][19] are used in SE. The concept presented in this paper opens <b>up</b> <b>an</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> approach, which can bring revolution in power system state monitoring and control...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 1990s the demand for vintage drum {{machines}} and synthesizers motivated a number of software companies to produce computer-based emulators. One of the most notable was the ReBirth RB-338, produced by the Swedish company Propellerhead and originally released in May 1997. Version one of the software featured two TB-303s and a TR-808 only, but the release of version two saw the inclusion of a TR-909. A Sound on Sound review of the RB-338 V2 in November 1998 noted that Rebirth had been called [...] "the ultimate techno software package" [...] and mentions that it was [...] "a considerable software success story of 1997".

2500|$|After he {{had already}} {{explored}} all {{that had previously been}} discovered, Bishop began to grow bored with the cave. He knew there was more out there, but there was a limit to how far the more experienced guides would go. The farthest anyone had been in the cave was to the bottomless pit: a massive hole of darkness. None would dare venture near the pit for fear of being lost forever in its depths. Bishop was brave and his curiosity was greater than his fear. Along with a guest who was equally as curious and daring as Bishop, the two men journeyed to the pit. With the help of an old ladder found nearby, they laid it across the gaping mouth of the pit and slowly ventured across the ladder. What the two men discovered opened <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> part of the cave. A short way further from the pit Bishop discovered a river. This was the first body of water that had ever been encountered in the cave. [...] As he explored the river he found eyeless fish: something that no one had ever heard about at this time. This brought scientists to the cave to study the new creature. Some of the most popular areas of the cave were both discovered and named by Bishop after crossing the bottomless pit.|$|E
2500|$|US forces {{sometimes}} employed sophisticated airmobile tactics, using integrated helicopter landings, artillery support, and troop insertions {{to surround}} enemy contacts and close off escape routes. The outstanding mobility {{of the helicopter}} made this possible, and these versatile machines could be sent into action in several configurations (troop transport, gunship, med-evac, heavy lift and supply). Helicopters allowed transport and deployment of infantry, artillery, medical, and supply elements to almost any location, presenting a formidable instrument that enhanced American and ARVN operations. When combined with other aerial elements such as fixed wing air support this combat power was multiplied, and opened <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> dimension of operational maneuver. But helicopters also had several vulnerabilities. They required a vast and expensive [...] "logistical tail" [...] of maintenance, fuel, munitions and bases. No nation except the US could afford such expense- fielding some 12,000 machines in Vietnam, almost half of which were shot down or lost due to accidents. The ability of helicopters to move men and material anywhere was impressive but also meant US and ARVN troops in some instances were heavily dependent on them. Destruction of the helicopter lifeline could derail an operation or maneuver, {{and the need to}} air-transport men and material to remote locations meant every new arrival of medevac, supply, transport or troop flights gave the VC/NVA yet another opportunity to cripple missions and machines. Helicopters were also very vulnerable to heavy machine guns, light AA artillery, portable SAMs like the Soviet Strela, and even concentrated small arms fire. According to some historians of airpower (Van Creveld 2011), costs were sometimes not commensurate with gains, and US airmobile operations might boil down to hugely expensive machines and their support systems chasing a handful of teenagers or second-string militiamen armed with cheap rifles.|$|E

Quasicrystalline approximants in the RE-Au-SM system have previously shown promising results regarding magnetic properties. To explore and discover properties like this is key to further improve the understanding of quasicrystalline materials.   The scope of the project was to explore the Gd-Au-Si system with compositions theoretically calculated to yield possible quasicrystals. In three batches with varying composition ratios, crystals were synthesised, using an arc-melting self-flux method. These were then analysed with powder X-ray diffraction, single crystal X-ray diffraction and electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to characterise the synthesised compounds using diffraction data and composition data respectively. The resulting crystals were determined to be of a ternary composition close to what was theoretically calculated. The phase synthesised is yet to be found in any previous work or database, possibly marking it out as a new phase, albeit the structure not being quasicrystalline in nature. Thus, the exploratory study yielded a so for unobserved composition in the Gd-Au-Si system...|$|R
