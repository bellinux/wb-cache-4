Three <b>types</b> of <b>insulator</b> topology are employed, single units, suspension-type and tension-type.

Also the direction of inward coming winds has some influence on the salt deposition to the insulator surfaces. Experiments showed that ESDD increases linearly with an increase in time of exposure.

40|$|A new {{methodology}} combining both High Voltage Techniques and Multicriterial Decision Making {{is presented}} in this paper. This method is applied on a Power Utilities' dilemma about {{the selection of the}} optimal <b>insulator</b> <b>type</b> at {{the construction of a new}} electrical network. This selection has been done among ten different <b>types</b> of <b>insulators,</b> which are widely used by Power Utilities. Initially the criteria on which the problem is based on are determined, in order the method to be applied. These criteria are four and concern the cost, the critical flashover voltage, the creepage distance and the diameter of the insulator. Each criterion has been expressed in a common reference scale and the values of the criteria have been normalized. A different weight is given to each criterion, characterizing its importance to the decision making. Finally, a matrix, which contains the four criteria and the possible choices is used to calculate the rate of agreement and the rate of disagreement. By making the proper combinations between the values of these two rates the method infers the optimal <b>insulator</b> <b>type...</b>|$|R

40|$|When {{holes are}} doped into a Mott-Hubbard <b>type</b> <b>insulator,</b> like lightly doped manganites of the La(1 -x) CaxMnO 3 family, the {{cooperative}} Jahn-Teller distortions {{and the appearance}} of orbital ordering require an arrangement of Mn(3 +) /Mn(4 +) for the establishment of the insulating canted antiferromagnetic (for x<= 0. 1), or of the insulating ferromagnetic (for 0. 1 <x<= 0. 2) ground state. In the present work we provide NMR evidence about a novel {{and at the same time}} puzzling effect in La(1 -x) CaxMnO(3 +delta) systems with cation deficience.

Comparison of our NMR results with recent x-ray absorption data at the Mn K edge, suggests the formation of a spin-polarized hole arrangement on the 2 p oxygen orbitals as the origin of this effect.

40|$|We {{perform a}} time-resolved optical study of Sr_ 2 IrO_ 4 to {{understand}} the influence of magnetic ordering on the low energy electronic structure of a strongly spin-orbit coupled J_eff= 1 / 2 Mott insulator.

The development of the insulating gap {{is accompanied by a}} transfer of in-gap spectral weight to energies far in excess of the gap and occurs over an unusually broad temperature window, which suggests Sr_ 2 IrO_ 4 to be a Slater- rather than Mott-Hubbard <b>type</b> <b>insulator</b> and naturally explains the absence of anomalies at T_N in transport and thermodynamic measurements...|$|R
