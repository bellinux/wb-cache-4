5|$|The Steam client, {{as part of}} {{a social}} network service, allows users to {{identify}} friends and join groups using the Steam Community feature. Users can use text chat and peer-to-peer VoIP with other users, identify which games their friends and other group members are playing, and join and invite friends to Steamworks-based multiplayer games that support this feature. Users can participate in forums hosted by Valve to discuss Steam games. Each user has a unique page that shows his or her groups and friends, game library including earned achievements, game wishlists, and other social features; users can choose to keep this information private. In January 2010, Valve reported that 10million of the 25million active Steam accounts had signed up to Steam Community. In conjunction with the 2012 Steam Summer Sale, user profiles were updated with Badges reflecting the user's participation in the Steam community and past events. Steam Trading Cards were introduced in beta in May 2013 and were fully supported by June 2013. By playing specific games, players would earn virtual trading cards, which they could trade with friends and use towards gaining rewards on the service such as game discounts, downloadable content, or in-game items, and customize their <b>user</b> <b>profile</b> page. In 2010, the Steam client became an OpenID provider, allowing third-party websites to use a Steam user's identity without requiring the user to expose his or her Steam credentials. In order to prevent abuse, access to most community features is restricted until a one-time payment of at least 5 is made to Valve. This requirement can be fulfilled by making any purchase of five dollars or more on Steam, or by adding at the same amount to their wallet.|$|E

Like {{the private}} sector, {{the public sector}} makes more and more use of <b>user</b> <b>profiling</b> to {{personalize}} the electronic services that are being offered to citizens. <b>User</b> <b>profiling</b> offers great opportunities to make communication more effective and efficient, to infer and predict citizens’ behavior and to even influence behavior. However, some drawbacks must be considered. Important differences between {{the private and public}} sec-tor hinder the full employment of <b>user</b> <b>profiling</b> for governments and some general <b>user</b> <b>profiling</b> obstacles, such as access, trust, control and privacy have to be overcome to make fruitful use of <b>user</b> <b>profiling.</b> ...|$|R

The in-creasing availability of big data is driving the urgent need for <b>user</b> <b>profiling</b> algorithms that are able to generate ac-curate <b>user</b> <b>profiles</b> from large-scale <b>user</b> behavior data. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic rating auto-encoder to perform unsupervised feature learning and generate la-tent <b>user</b> feature <b>profiles</b> from large-scale <b>user</b> rating data. Based on the generated <b>user</b> <b>profiles,</b> neighborhood based col-laborative filtering approaches have been adopted to make personalized rating predictions.

Experts on the panel considered the two main obstacles to doing this as being skepticism towards Wikipedia {{and the history of}} biased editing from Congressional staffers. The Cato Institute suggested one way to overcome these issues would be for the staffers to create user accounts and <b>user</b> <b>profile</b> pages disclosing their connections with Congress.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{the amino}} acid {{sequences}} of a representative set of all known three-dimensional protein structures is compiled, and these sequences are processed by scanning against a large protein sequence database. The {{result is a}} database of profiles or HMMs, one for each known 3D structure. A user sequence of interest is similarly processed to form a profile/HMM. This <b>user</b> <b>profile</b> is then scanned against the database of profiles using profile-profile or HMM-HMM alignment techniques. These alignments can also take into account patterns of predicted or known secondary structure elements and can be scored using various statistical models.

25|$|In a May 2017 patch for Rivals, the Rivals mode {{switched}} to an 8-week Seasonal system, rewarding Crews for placement {{at the end}} of the season with unique in-game gear, and eliminating demotions. The update also introduced Missions, similar to the Challenges used in Rock Band 3, that require players to meet certain goals to complete; some of these will include Missions for Crews as well as single-player challenges. Completing Missions earns unique badges players can showcase on their <b>user</b> <b>profile</b> in-game. The new server architecture of Rock Band 4 allowed Harmonix to update and add Missions over time without having to patch the game. With the second Season in this new format, Harmonix will offer a Season Spotlight Pass that give the purchaser eight new songs over that Season that are featured as Spotlight songs in the Rivals challenges at a small discount over buying all eight songs individually.|$|E

40|$|<b>User</b> <b>profiling</b> {{forms the}} basis for search engine {{personalization}} applications. Search engines are personalized so that they optimize the retrieval quality of <b>user</b> queries. <b>User</b> <b>profiling</b> done through concept-based mining identifies terms that render conceptual meaning as well as unimportant terms. Both positive and negative preferences from such conceptual terms are used in creating the <b>user</b> <b>profiles</b> and such profiles built based on both the preferences of a user reflect his/her interests at finer details. Based on these accurate and up-to-date <b>user</b> <b>profiles,</b> relationships between <b>users</b> can be mined to perform Collaborative Filtering (CF) thereby allowing users with the same interests to share their profiles. Collaborative filtering filters information about a user based on a collection of <b>user</b> <b>profiles</b> that are already built from the extracted preferences. <b>Users</b> having similar <b>profiles</b> may share similar interests. The concept-based search enhanced by Collaborative Filtering improves the relevancy of search results by making automatic predictions about the interests of a user by collecting similar <b>user</b> <b>profiles...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Most of the {{companies}} have the web sites for their business. Most of the customers of the organization register their details as <b>user</b> <b>profiles.</b> These <b>user</b> <b>profiles</b> have the personal details and their interesting habits of the customer.

30|$|The {{number of}} queries {{stored in the}} <b>user</b> <b>profiles</b> impacts the {{efficiency}} of SimAttack. To measure this impact, we depict on Fig. 11 the precision and the recall of SimAttack for TMN 100 when the <b>profile</b> of <b>users</b> pre-built by the adversary only contains a sub part of their query history (from 0 to 100 %). Results show that exploiting smaller <b>user</b> <b>profiles</b> make harder the identification of user queries by SimAttack. For instance, if we consider 100 % of the <b>user</b> <b>profiles,</b> SimAttack identifies 36.8 % or 45.3 % of queries (depending on the exploitation or not of the prior knowledge) while this number drops to 12.6 % or 15.3 % if we consider only 5 % of the <b>user</b> <b>profiles.</b> However, {{the quality of the}} attack (i.e., the precision) increases. For instance, decreasing the number of queries considered in the <b>user</b> <b>profiles</b> from 100 to 5 % makes the precision increases from 21.7 to 92 %. Indeed, with less accurate <b>user</b> <b>profiles,</b> SimAttack does not have enough information to correctly retrieve the users. Consequently, increasing the size of <b>user</b> <b>profiles</b> increases the recall of SimAttack, but also decreases the precision as more queries get misclassified.|$|R
