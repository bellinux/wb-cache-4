It made sense because it opened up for us a way of talking about an actual poem in an actual classroom, and because the technique of focusing upon a poem as language rather than as history or biography or morality, gave a whole new meaning to and justification for the teaching of poetry (qtd. in Singh 1991).|$|E

50|$|The chapter {{presents}} the metaphysical {{definition of a}} human being as Consciousness, Atman, Soul. In verse 3, it develops the foundation for this definition by explaining that speech cannot define a human being, because we see human beings midst <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> born without the power of speech (dumb); that sight cannot define a human being, because we see human beings midst <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> born without the ability of sight (blind); that hearing cannot define a human being, because we see human beings midst <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> born without the ability to hear (deaf); that mind cannot define a human being, because we see human beings midst <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> without the power of clear thinking (foolishness); that arms or legs cannot define a human being, because we see human beings midst <b>us</b> <b>who</b> lose their arms or legs (cut in an accident). A being has life-force, which is consciousness. And that which is conscious, has life-force.|$|R

25|$|According to Maj. (Retd.)

Maj Mazhar states that the Pakistan Army's senior command failed {{to realize that the}} Chinese would be unable to intervene during the winter months of November to December, due to snowbound Himalayan passes, and the US had not made any real effort to persuade India against attacking East Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|Several new {{products}} were developed internally at Frito-Lay and {{launched in the}} 1990s, the most successful of which was Sun Chips, a multi-grain chip first sold in 1991. Sun Chips, along with new Baked (instead of fried) variants of Tostitos and Lay's, represented Frito-Lay's intent to capitalize on an emerging trend among adults in the <b>U.S.,</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> displaying a growing preference for healthier snack alternatives. In 1994, Frito-Lay recorded annual retail sales of nearly $5 billion, selling 8 billion bags of chips, popcorn, and pretzels during that year—outpacing competitors Eagle (owned by Anheuser-Busch) and Wise (owned by Borden).|$|E

500|$|The {{government}} did not approve a public memorial service {{for the deaths of}} Diệm and Nhu until 1968. In 1971, several thousand mourners gathered at Diệm's purported gravesite. Catholic prayers were given in Latin. Banners proclaimed Diệm as a saviour of the south, with some mourners having walked into Saigon from villages outside the capital carrying portraits of Diệm. Madame Thiệu, the First Lady, was seen weeping at a requiem mass at Saigon's basilica. Several cabinet members were also at the grave and a eulogy was given by a general of the ARVN. According to the eulogy, Diệm died because he had resisted the domination of foreigners and their plans to bring great numbers of troops to Vietnam and widen a war which would have destroyed the country. Thiệu sponsored the services, and it was widely seen as a means of associating himself with Diệm's personal characteristics. Diệm frequently refused to follow American advice and was known for his personal integrity, in contrast to Thieu, who was infamous for corruption and regarded as being too close to the Americans. However, Thiệu's attempts to associate himself with Diệm's relative independence from United States influence was not successful. According to General Maxwell Taylor, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, [...] "there was the memory of Diệm to haunt those of <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> aware of the circumstances of his downfall. By our complicity, we Americans were responsible for the plight in which the South Vietnamese found themselves".|$|E

[...] There were pan-Orthodox celebrations; Sunday of Orthodoxy gatherings were major events and the spirit of the faithful and clergy was elevated in this gathering of the Church. [...] Now we look back just ten years later and find the gathering of bishops at Ligonier is hailed as the greatest event of American Orthodoxy! [...] I wonder how the canonization of America's first saint is relegated to some lesser place in the life of Orthodoxy in America. [...] Even Ligonier was hopeful to those of <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> serving the churches in multiple jurisdictions.

2500|$|.....In the {{beginning}} of the contest with G. Britain, when we were sensible of danger we had daily prayer in this room for the Divine Protection.

All of <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> engaged in the struggle must have observed frequent instances of a Superintending providence in our favor.... And have we now forgotten that powerful friend? or do we imagine that we no longer need His assistance. I have lived, Sir, a long time and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth—that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the sacred writings that [...] "except the Lord build they labor in vain that build it." [...] I firmly believe this; and I also believe that without his concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than the Builders of Babel:... I therefore beg leave to move—that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of Heaven, and its blessings on our deliberations, be held in this Assembly every morning before we proceed to business, and that {{one or more of the}} Clergy of this City be requested to officiate in that service.|$|E
