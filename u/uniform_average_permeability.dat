40|$|Abstract: The Lorenz {{curve is}} used to {{estimate}} the heterogeneity of an oil reservoir. The corresponding permeability distributions {{in a series of}} concept reservoir models with a <b>uniform</b> <b>average</b> <b>permeability</b> but different heterogeneities are obtained and characterized by inverse calculation of the Lorenz curve. Then the development laws of a reservoir in relation to its heterogeneity are studied in method of numerical simulation. The results show that reservoirs with a Vk (permeability variation coefficient is defined in appendix) which characterizes the heterogeneity less than 0. 2 have almost the same development rule. It is also found that the permeability profile is consistent with the water-cut profile in both positive and reverse rhythm reservoirs where injected water channels in high permeable layers. Furthermore, the water-cut profile of a reverse rhythm reservoir is more uniform than that of a positive rhythm reservoir. In addition, results also show an exponential relation between water-free recovery and variation coefficients in positive rhythm heterogeneous reservoirs. From the simulation results of reservoir models with different oil-water viscosity ratios, it is found that during the development process, the water-free recovery firstly decreases rapidly with an increasing oil/water viscosity ratio less than 30 : 1 before it decreases slightly. Besides, a modified logistic function is built to present the relation between ultimate recovery and variation coefficient for positive rhythm reservoirs. The ultimate recovery firstly decreases slightly before the permeability variation coefficient increases up to 0. 4, and then decreases sharply. However, the inflexion of variation coefficient in a reverse rhythm one is 0. 6. An algebraic equation is also built to describe the water cut change with th...|$|E

30|$|As {{permeability}} ratio increases (keeping the <b>average</b> <b>permeability</b> is the constant), {{the production}} rate will decrease. At first, {{the production rate}} declines with permeability ratio rapidly, then the production rate becomes almost constant. In other words, the production rate has a big relationship with maximum and minimum permeability ratio when keeping the <b>average</b> <b>permeability</b> is the constant. As we known, the permeability ratio means the homogeneousness of the tight gas reservoirs. Therefore, the permeability is more homogeneous when the ratio is smaller, whereas it is more heterogeneous.

30|$|To {{calculate}} <b>average</b> <b>permeability,</b> weighted-average permeability, harmonic-average permeability, and geometric-average permeability {{techniques are}} derived from experimental evaluations (McCain et al. 2011). The method of calculating <b>average</b> <b>permeability</b> used in this research in the section of core analysis is weighted-average <b>permeability.</b> This <b>averaging</b> process is {{used to determine the}} <b>average</b> <b>permeability</b> of layered-parallel beds with different permeabilities. Dealing with the coherent diagenetic and depositional complexity of carbonated reservoirs is considered as one the main challenges of petroleum industries for several decades. Thereby, engineers try to find novel solutions by using harnessing technologies to reduce vast sums of money which they spent for measuring reservoir properties. Wireline logging tools may confidentially provide a reasonable solution for obtaining the proper value of porosity and fluid saturation; nevertheless, in the case of permeability measurements, it may be debatable. Furthermore, core plugs are not the best candidate tools to measure the characterization of fractured and vuggy intervals (Ali Ahmadi et al. 2013; Frash et al. 2016; Sullivan 2007). Evaluating the appropriate properties of each layered reservoirs is considered as the underlying issues of engineering and geological perspectives. Also, determining the proper value of these crucial parameters exerts a profound impact on the primary and secondary oil recovery procedures, where the different layer permeabilities may lead to differential depletion. There are a wide variety of applied techniques to estimate the amount of permeability in the layered reservoirs in which the most important ones are core analysis, sidewall samples, wireline logging correlations, NMR logs, wireline formation testers, drill stem tests (DST), and production logging tools (Amir Shah et al. 2017; Kading 1976; Qobi et al. 2000; Quintero et al. 1999; Sætrom et al. 2016).|$|R
30|$|With pores, fractures, and {{cavities}} {{of various}} genesis as reservoir space, {{this type of}} reservoir mainly occurs in Layer A {{at the top of}} KT-I, and is composed of calcareous dolomite with minor dolomitic limestone. Reservoir space in this type of reservoir is most diverse due to the combined effects of meteoric leaching and uplifting and erosion, including pores, fractures, and dissolved cavities of various origins. The fractures are dominated by diagenetic dissolved fractures, followed by structural fractures. This type of reservoir largely occurs in A 1, A 2, and A 3 layers in the upper part of KT-I 30 – 80  m below the KT-I top. With an average porosity of 13.2  % and <b>average</b> <b>permeability</b> of 22.8  mD (Table  2), it is one type of reservoir with fairly good physical properties in the study area.

40|$|Goal of {{this project}} was {{to get a better}} {{understanding}} of the producing formations in the two doublets in the Van den Bosch Geothermal energy concession in Bleiswijk. It can be concluded based on the GR logs in VDB- 04, the lithologs, End Of Well reports, a Biostrat log in VDB- 04 and the seismic interpretation that the first doublet (VDB- 01 & VDB- 02) produces from a combination of the Rijswijk Member and another aggradational stacked sand formation. The second doublet (VDB- 03 & VDB- 04) produces from the Delft Sandstone. It is expected that producer and injector in each doublet have good communication and interference between the doublets is absent because the reservoirs are separated by the Rodenrijs Shale and production pressures and rates are constant for years. A regional well log correlation based on Maximum Flooding Surfaces is carried out to put the interpretation of the reservoir sands into a regional context with the surrounding oil fields. Using seismic interpretation the thickness and lateral extension of the Rijswijk and Delft reservoirs is determined. With these interpretations a static model is built of the reservoirs of the two doublets. In the second part of the project, field data from the past four years of production is analysed. The data consists of production rates, pump pressures and a well test in VDB- 01. Using a Monte Carlo simulation ranges of the <b>average</b> <b>permeability</b> are calculated. The ranges of the <b>average</b> <b>permeability</b> are 200 - 500 mD in the Rijswijk and 300 - 600 in the Delft Sandstone. The main uncertainties in these estimated ranges are the Flowing Bottom Hole Pressure (FBHP) calculations, the skin and the thickness of the formation. In a history match exercise, production is simulated in a Dynamic model in Eclipse 100. The tuning parameter is the <b>average</b> horizontal <b>permeability.</b> In addition the influence on the simulation results of the vertical permeability, the skin and the fluvial shape factors is investigated. Resulting ranges of the <b>average</b> horizontal <b>permeability</b> are similar to those calculated with the radial inflow Monte Carlo simulation: 100 - 300 mD for the Rijswijk and 300 - 400 mD for the Delft Sandstone. Simulations show that the vertical permeability has a large influence on the reservoir performance and is therefore an important uncertainty. An initial estimation of the Rijswijk kvertical is 70 % of Khorizontal and 22 / 386 *khorizontal in the Delft Sandstone. This is based on earlier studies. Especially in the Rijswijk situation, the estimate may be too large. If the vertical permeability decreases, the horizontal permeability should increase to compensate in the history match. In that case the <b>average</b> <b>permeability</b> range approaches the results from the radial inflow equation analysis more. The well test was plagued by wellbore effects and a too short build-up period. Therefore no reliable parameters could be derived and compared to the radial inflow analysis and history match results. However the analysis showed that a well performed well test could give insight in skin, <b>average</b> <b>permeability</b> and flow boundaries.
