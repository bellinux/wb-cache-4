25|$|By 1975, both Number 96 and The Box, {{perhaps as}} a {{reaction}} to declining ratings for both shows, de-emphasised the sex and nudity shifting more towards comedic plots. Class of '74 was renamed Class of '75 and also added more slapstick comedy for its second year, but the revamped show's ratings declined, resulting in its cancellation in mid-1975. That year Cash Harmon's newly launched second soap The Unisexers failed in its early evening slot and was cancelled after three weeks; the Reg Grundy Organisation's second soap <b>Until</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> ran in a daytime slot for 180 episodes.|$|E
500|$|In December 1902, the German {{government}} asked Roosevelt to arbitrate its {{dispute with}} Venezuela over unpaid debts. [...] Hay {{did not think}} this appropriate, as Venezuela also owed the U.S. money, and quickly arranged for the International Court of Arbitration in The Hague to step in. [...] Hay supposedly said, as final details were being worked out, [...] "I have it all arranged. [...] If Teddy will {{keep his mouth shut}} <b>until</b> <b>tomorrow</b> noon!" [...] Hay and Roosevelt also differed over the composition of the Joint High Commission that was to settle the Alaska boundary dispute. [...] The commission was to be composed of [...] "impartial jurists" [...] and the British and Canadians duly appointed notable judges. [...] Roosevelt appointed politicians, including Secretary Root and Senator Lodge. [...] Although Hay was supportive of the President's choices in public, in private he protested loudly to Roosevelt, complained by letter to his friends, and offered his resignation. [...] Roosevelt declined it, but the incident confirmed him in his belief that Hay was too much of an Anglophile to be trusted where Britain was concerned. [...] The American position on the boundary dispute was imposed on Canada by a 4–2 vote, with the one English judge joining the three Americans.|$|E
2500|$|Police also {{discovered}} several documents on Talcott's body. [...] The documents included {{the letter from}} Mrs. Talcott's sister urging Talcott to act, a grand jury subpoena from the investigation of Moore, and quantities of advertising literature for Hydrox Ice Cream. [...] However, the item that drew the most attention in the press was a cryptic handwritten note that appeared to contain a threat against Talcott. [...] The note read, [...] "Friday, P.M. -- I will give you <b>until</b> <b>tomorrow</b> morning before you leave the house to withdraw from this case or I will introduce [...] damaging evidence of six years ago." [...] Talcott's brother-in-law, George E. Repp, told police that he believed the note was Talcott's effort to record a threat made by Mrs. Talcott. [...] Repp described an angry encounter at the Talcott residence:"Talcott, in writing the threat, was but quoting the words of his own wife. [...] I was {{with them in the}} Talcott home the day before Talcott testified against Dr. Moore. Mrs. Talcott then threatened to reveal happenings of six years ago if he didn't drop out of Monroe's prosecution." ...|$|E

[...] The Prix Pierre Chany is now awarded each year to the writer of the season's best cycling work in French. It was established in 1989.

London’s news grinder – {{and this}} goes for both broadcasting and print – processes Australia’s election into a daily blink-and-you-missed-it snapshot. By turns lurid and sober, each episode features a testy leading character, his snappy rival, {{and the occasional}} eccentric extra. The audience is wholly unseen. The producers {{do their best to}} squeeze sense into the seconds or column inches available. Then the shutter comes down – <b>until</b> <b>tomorrow’s</b> glimpse.

It includes two London-generated “brand extensions” – Guardian Australia and Spectator Australia – spraying welcome and punchy, if also hectic, commentary. Easy to find, undemanding to read, hard to love. The combination of morsel and glut can leave the reader gasping, like Grace Kelly in Hitchcock’s Rear Window: “Tell me what you know, and what you think it means!” So it is a relief to find occasional sustenance in a more reflective or detailed piece from a reporter.

5000|$|As Bree and Rex's marital {{problems}} continue to surface, Bree tries {{to cover up}} the fact that she and Rex are in counseling since she {{does not want to be}} seen as weak or to be mocked for her [...] "failed" [...] marriage. When Rex asks what their cover story is, Bree replies that they will be taking tennis lessons and hands him a racket, which they will both use as decoys before and after the sessions. Bree's plans quickly backfire, as Rex tells everyone at the dinner party that he and Bree are in marriage counseling. Suddenly, Bree drops a plate but quickly changes her tone as dinner is about to be served. The following day, Bree packs Rex's bags as he tells her that he has checked into a motel and they discuss how they are going to tell the kids about their separation. Bree jokes that she can say that he [...] "went to tennis camp" [...] which Rex does not find in the least funny. Later, Bree visits Dr. Goldfine's office in the hopes that she can talk to him about what happened the evening prior. Dr. Goldfine tells Bree he is in between clients and that she will have to wait <b>until</b> <b>tomorrow's</b> appointment. As Dr. Goldfine walks into the hallway, Bree snoops around and find Rex's tape from his private session. Instead of taking it, she suspiciously comes across a tape labeled [...] "Young, Mary Alice".

25|$|Poirot has had Sheppard and Caryl round for dinner. They {{are expecting}} further guests as Poirot {{has asked the}} {{household}} from Fernley to call round but his first visitor is Bourne, panicked over a newspaper report that Poirot asked Davies to insert claiming that Ralph had been arrested in Liverpool. This forces Bourne {{to admit that she}} and Ralph are married. She had confessed this to Sir Roger and he had dismissed her. Ralph came to Fernley after an urgent telegram from her but she insists they only met in the summerhouse for ten minutes and then she left him there. Poirot wants her to join the others when they arrive and Caryl insists that the former maid can stay the night at their house. She goes to make arrangements as the party from Fernley arrives. Poirot asks them to sit down as he addresses them and he first reveals Bourne's marriage to Ralph. However the time when the two people met in the summerhouse coincided with the time that Sir Roger's voice was heard behind the closed study door. They are therefore all puzzled as to who was with him but Poirot has another idea – no one was with him: the formal words that Ackroyd were using were intended for the Dictaphone. This creates problems for Ralph as his alibi for the time is now useless and Raymond thinks the young man should come forward and explain himself. Poirot agrees and opens the curtains to the conservatory, revealing Ralph. Poirot guessed that Sheppard met him that night, knowing that he had gone to the inn where he was staying, and had then hidden him. Poirot further deduced that a doctor would hide someone in a nursing home, hence his questions to Caryl. Ralph’s alibi is now useless and Poirot tells the assembled group that to save him the real murderer – {{who is one of the}} people in the room – must confess. They have <b>until</b> midday <b>tomorrow</b> and then Poirot will go to the police.|$|R
2500|$|The terms verlig ("enlightened") and verkramp ("cramped") {{entered the}} Afrikaans (and later English) vernacular {{during the late}} 1960s. They were first used in a speech by prof. [...] (son of Jan de Klerk and brother of future State President of South Africa, F.W. de Klerk) on 6 October 1966, exactly {{a month after the}} {{assassination}} of dr. Hendrik Verwoerd. In his speech, De Klerk distinguished between verligte, verkrampte, and positiewe ("positive") Afrikaners. This threefold division would soon be simplified in the colloquial language to a simpler dichotomous partition between simply verlig and verkramp. What De Klerk called [...] "positive Afrikaners" [...] would then refer to what generally became known as verligte Afrikaners. He described positive Afrikaners (verligtes, thus) as [...] "purpose conscious Afrikaners". [...] "And purpose means to recognize the enduring and the changing. The closedness and the openness. The tradition and the progression... The purpose conscious Afrikaner recognizes and appreciates the tradition, and yet he is the man of today and with a vision on <b>tomorrow,</b> <b>until</b> eternity. The Afrikaner heritage is the Afrikaner-Christendom with the Calvinistic bedrock which recognizes the authority of the Bible as revelation and guide. But also he is open to further study of Scripture and he seeks the new roads to expand his religious heritage. At the same time the Afrikaner culture is young and virile, and is still busy to form itself on many levels, without having to cut ties with the past. The Book teaches clearly that exaggerated nationalism (idolatry of the People) as well as cosmopolitism contrast with the stipulations of God. Just as ungodly is the nationalized religion, which is the same as idolatry of the People." ...|$|R
