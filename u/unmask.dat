5|$|When Tarzan Boy {{was injured}} {{and unable to}} wrestle Bucanero and Guerrero {{recruited}} Máscara Mágica to even the numbers. The storyline between the two factions reaches its high point at the CMLL 68th Anniversary Show where all seven wrestlers faced off in a steel cage match. The stipulation of the match was that the winning side would gain the rights to use the name Los Infernales while the loser {{on the opposite side}} would be forced to <b>unmask</b> or have their hair shaved off. In the end El Satánico pinned Máscara Mágica, forcing him to <b>unmask.</b> After losing the match Guerrero, Bucanero and Tarzan Boy became known collectively as Los Guerreros del Infierno (The Infernal Soldiers).|$|E
5|$|Initially Guerrero worked lower card matches, in the first-to-third {{match on}} the show with some success. On September 11, 1998 he {{defeated}} Mr. Águila in his first ever Lucha de Apuestas match, forcing his opponent to <b>unmask</b> and reveal his real name {{as part of the}} CMLL 65th Anniversary Show. Mr. Águila already worked for the World Wrestling Federation without his mask, so it was not seen as a surprise that he lost to Guerrero. In 1999 Último Guerrero teamed up with veteran Blue Panther to win the Gran Alternativa ("Grea Alternative") tournament, a tournament where a young wrestler teams with a veteran. Winning the Gran Alternativa tournament is often a sign that the promotion has plans to move a wrestler up the rankings. Shortly after winning the tournament, Guerrero won a match that made him the number one contender for Great Sasuke's NWA World Middleweight Championship. Último Guerrero did not win the match but the fact that he worked a featured match in CMLL's main arena, Arena México, showed that the company had plans for him.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Mexico, Stock signed with Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), AAA's rival promotion. She began working regularly for CMLL as Dark Angel in the promotion's newly-rebuilt women's division, while also working for various independent promotions. On March 25, 2005, she defeated Princesa Sujei to win Federación Internacional de Lucha Libre Women's Championship. On September 9, Stock {{was one of}} two winners, along with Marcela, of a Torneo cibernetico elimination match to determine who would get to battle for the vacant CMLL World Women's Championship. However, on September 16, at CMLL's 72nd Anniversary Show, Marcela defeated Stock to win the title. Afterwards, Stock entered a feud with La Amapola, which concluded on April 14, 2006, when Stock put her hair on the line against Amapola's mask. Stock ended up winning the match and forcing Amapola to <b>unmask</b> herself.|$|E
5|$|Coon {{decides to}} rid the town of Mysterion, enlisting the help of Professor Chaos (Butters) and his sidekick General Disarray (Dougie). Unlike the Coon, Professor Chaos and General Disarray have become as {{familiar}} to the residents of South Park as Mysterion. Butters also wants to know the identity of Mysterion but can only narrow the list of suspects to the boys from Mr. Garrison's 4th grade class whose shapes do not differ greatly from that of others. In contrast, he has nearly pinned down Coon's identity to a few fat celebrities, and Cartman. In a scheme to uncover Mysterion's identity, the Coon convinces Professor Chaos to threaten {{the destruction of a}} hospital unless Mysterion reveals his identity. After the Coon plants the TNT and leaves to buy detonators, Mysterion unexpectedly arrives. He points out that this is not Professor Chaos' usual style, and fights Professor Chaos and General Disarray on top of the building. A crowd forms below and cheers on Mysterion as the police take no actions, believing that their bullets are no match for Professor Chaos' aluminum foil armor. Dramatically, the Coon appears to fight on the side of Mysterion, with the hopes that he too will be hailed as a hero. At that point, Professor Chaos and General Disarray run off in defeat. After their victory, the Coon convinces Mysterion to <b>unmask</b> himself by claiming such threats to public safety will continue until Mysterion's secret is revealed.|$|E
5|$|During the summer, La Máscara {{formed a}} trio named Los Ingobernables ("The Ungovernables") with Rush and La Sombra {{with the three}} {{essentially}} wrestling as rudos and being {{referred to as the}} most hated wrestlers in the past decade. On April 8, 2016, La Máscara defeated Ángel de Oro to win the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship, becoming the 15th light heavyweigt champion {{in the history of the}} championship. After the match he got into an altercation with Ángel de Oro's corner man Dragon Lee. On May 13, the partnership between La Máscara and Rush came to an end, when Rush and Pierroth turned on their Los Ingobernables stablemate. Following the turn, La Máscara declared war on the entire Muñoz family, which included Rush, Pierroth, Dragon Lee and Místico. La Máscara won the 2016 Leyenda de Plata tournament when he defeated Negro Casas in the finals, held on July 22. On August 5, La Máscara accepted a challenge from Dragon Lee for a Mask vs. Mask Lucha de Apuestas between the two. On September 2 in the main event of the 83rd Anniversary Show, La Máscara was defeated by Dragon Lee and was forced to <b>unmask</b> and reveal his birthname. Afterwards, La Máscara reconciled with Rush.|$|E

40|$|Candida albicans is a virulent human {{opportunistic}} pathogen. It evades innate {{immune surveillance}} by masking an immunogenic cell wall polysaccharide, β-glucan, from recognition by the immunoreceptor Dectin- 1. Glucan <b>unmasking</b> by the antifungal drug caspofungin leads {{to changes in}} the nanostructure of glucan exposure accessible to Dectin- 1. The physical mechanism that regulates glucan exposure is poorly understood, but it controls the nanobiology of fungal pathogen recognition. We created computational models to simulate hypothetical physical processes of <b>unmasking</b> glucan in a biologically realistic distribution of cell wall glucan fibrils. We tested the predicted glucan exposure nanostructural features arising from these models against experimentally measured values. A completely spatially random <b>unmasking</b> process, reflective of random environmental damage to the cell wall, cannot account for experimental observations of glucan <b>unmasking.</b> However, the introduction of partially edge biased <b>unmasking</b> processes, consistent with an <b>unmasking</b> contribution from active, local remodeling at glucan exposure sites, produces markedly more accurate predictions of experimentally observed glucan nanoexposures in untreated and caspofungin-treated yeast. These findings suggest a model of glucan <b>unmasking</b> wherein cell wall remodeling processes in the local nanoscale neighborhood of glucan exposure sites are an important contributor to the physical process of drug-induced glucan <b>unmasking</b> in C. albicans...|$|R
50|$|For the Ruleta de la Muerte tournament IWRG {{teamed up}} eight teams of rudos and tecnicos, some masked and some <b>unmasked.</b> The teams were El Hijo del Diablo (<b>unmasked,</b> rudo) and Zatura (masked, tecnico), Oficial AK-47 (masked, rudo) and El Hijo de Pirata Morgan (masked, tecnico), Capitan Muerte (masked, rudo) and Miss Gaviota (<b>unmasked</b> tecnico).

5|$|From January 14 to 19, 2014, Guerrero {{worked his}} first Fantastica Mania tour, co-produced by CMLL and New Japan Pro Wrestling in Japan. On March 28, 2014, Guerrero, Euforia and Niebla Roja {{defeated}} Los Estetas del Aire (Máscara Dorada, Místico and Valiente) for the CMLL World Trios Championship. On August 29, Guerrero defeated La Sombra {{in the finals}} to win the 2014 Universal Championship, becoming the first two-time winner of the tournament. On September 19, Guerrero lost to Atlantis in the main event of the CMLL 81st Anniversary Show and thus was forced to <b>unmask</b> {{for the first time}} in his career and reveal his birth name; José Gutiérrez Hernández. In January 2015, Guerrero returned to Japan to take part in the Fantastica Mania 2015 tour, during which he defeated Atlantis in a rematch. On February 13, Los Guerreros Laguneros lost the CMLL World Trios Championship to Sky Team (Místico, Valiente and Volador Jr.). On July 17, Guerrero defeated Rey Escorpión in a Lucha de Apuestas in the main event of Sin Salida forcing Escorpión to have all his hair shaved off after the match as per the stipulation. On August 31, Guerrero defeated La Sombra to win the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|In early 2010 La Sombra began a storyline {{feud with}} El Felino. The feud began on February 2, 2010, during a singles match between El Felino and La Sombra; when tied at one fall each, Puma King, El Felino's son, showed up wearing an El Felino outfit and mask, distracting both the referee and La Sombra {{long enough for}} El Felino to land a low blow on La Sombra to win the match. The two met in a Lighting match (a one fall, 10 minute time limit match) on the February 19 CMLL Super Viernes show. Once again Puma King tried to help his uncle, {{but this time the}} referee disqualified El Felino for the transgression. La Sombra and El Felino {{continued}} to feud, both interfering in a match between Volador Jr. and Místico. The storyline led to Místico, Volador Jr., La Sombra and El Felino being booked in a four-way Lucha de Apuestas match as the main event of the 2010 2010 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas ("Homage to Two Legends") show. La Sombra was the first man pinned at Dos Leyendas and El Felino was the second, forcing the two to compete with their masks on the line. La Sombra pinned El Felino, forcing him to <b>unmask</b> and reveal his real name.|$|E
5|$|On February 15, 2013, La Sombra {{defeated}} Volador Jr. {{to win the}} 2013 Reyes del Aire tournament. Following their clash {{over the}} Reyes del Aire trophy Volador Jr. and La Sombra were teamed up for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles tournament, the same tournament that in 2010 was the impetus for Volador Jr.'s rudo turn. The rivals put their issues aside for the tournament, defeating the teams of Guerrero Maya Jr. and Negro Casas, La Máscara and Averno, and Shocker and Mr. Niebla {{to qualify for the}} finals of the tournament. On March 15, at the 2013 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show, Volador Jr. and La Sombra defeated Altantis and Último Guerrero to win the Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles. The truce between La Sombra and Volador Jr. that allowed them to win the tag team tournament only lasted until the next time the two rivals were in the same ring. On February 17, 2013 La Sombra teamed up with Marco Corleone and Místico II against Volador Jr., Euforia and Último Guerrero. During the match Volador Jr. attacked both La Sombra and the referee, causing a disqualification before leaving the ring and his confused partners behind. On September 13 at CMLL's 80th Anniversary Show, La Sombra and Volador Jr. defeated Atlantis and Último Guerrero in a Relevos Suicidas match and thus advanced to a Mask vs. Mask Lucha de Apuestas against each other.

5|$|Rey Hechicero {{made his}} debut on February 15, 2001, {{in his home}} town of Monterrey, Nuevo León working for a local wrestling promotion. In 2004, he was listed as having worked a number of matches for the Naucalpan, State of Mexico based International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) but did not tour {{extensively}} outside Nuevo León. In 2007, Rey Hechicero became involved in a storyline feud against another local Monterrey wrestler called Gitano del Norte ("The Gypsy of the North"), a storyline that led to both men putting their masks on the line {{on the outcome of}} a Lucha de Apuestas ("Bet match"). Rey Hechicero won and forced his opponent to <b>unmask,</b> which in Lucha Libre is considered more prestigious than winning championships. He capped 2007 by defeating Tigre Universitario to win the WWA World Middleweight Championship Defeating Tigre Universitario for the championship was part of a long running storyline between the two, a storyline that would see both of them involved in a four-man Lucha de Apuesta on March 23, 2008. Both Rey Hechicero and Tigre Universitario escaped from the match with their masks while Valiente pinned Sergio Romo, Jr. to force Romo to be shaved bald after the match since he was not masked.|$|E
5|$|Following the Super Viernes on August 13, 2010, {{where he}} {{attacked}} La Máscara, Volador Jr. began being booked as rudo, although the on again, off again feud with Místico {{was put to}} the side in favor of Volador Jr. against La Sombra. The feud between the two led both wrestlers to be booked in the main event of the CMLL 77th Anniversary Show, a 14-man steel cage Lucha de Apuesta, mask vs. mask match. Volador Jr. was the 10th man to leave the steel cage, keeping his mask safe. The match came down to La Sombra pinning Olímpico to <b>unmask</b> him.

5|$|In April 2011, Averno began feuding with La Máscara, {{building}} a storyline {{that led to}} a Mask vs. Mask Lucha de Apuesta on June 17. The match announcement came {{on the heels of a}} report that Averno had signed a contract with WWE, supposedly following long time in-ring rival Místico who had already signed with WWE. On June 17 at CMLL's Juicio Final ("Final Judgement") show, Averno was defeated by La Máscara two falls to one and thus was forced to <b>unmask.</b> Upon unmasking, Averno revealed that his real name was Renato Ruíz Cortes, that he was 34 years old originally from Mexico City and had been wrestling for 16 years. Afterward, Ruíz and La Máscara continued their rivalry, building up to another singles match on July 4, where Ruíz successfully defended the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship. Despite rumors Averno never began working for WWE, opting at the time to stay with CMLL. On July 15, Los Hijos del Averno defeated La Generación Dorada (La Máscara, Máscara Dorada and La Sombra) to win the CMLL World Trios Championship. On September 9, 2011 Averno entered CMLL's annual tournament of champions, the Universal Championship tournament.

40|$|<b>Unmasking</b> is a {{recurrent}} feature of modern sociology and cultural criticism. While false consciousness is imputed by intellectuals to religious groups and to certain social classes, <b>unmasking</b> is, or claims to be, a corrective performed by intellectuals themselves. <b>Unmasking</b> supposes that enlightened enquirers {{are able to}} help the less rational to understand their real interests; a type of exposure, it offers a cognitive tool of emancipation. This article (a) examines unmasking; and (b) contrasts it with an approach to understanding that we call disclosure. Our claim is that disclosure is more attuned to the full keyboard of social action, and less demeaning of its players, than <b>unmasking</b> is. Disclosure attempts to grasp what actions are like for those who enact them. Nothing has been more often or consistently <b>unmasked</b> and with more venom than religion.

40|$|In {{the past}} decades, {{hundreds}} of articles have explored the mechanisms underlying priming. Most researchers assume that masked and <b>unmasked</b> priming are qualitatively different.

In contrast, other researchers have claimed that masked and <b>unmasked</b> priming reflect essentially the same core processes. In this article, we use the diffusion model (R. Ratcliff, 1978, A theory of memory retrieval, Psychological Review, Vol. 85, pp. 59 – 108) to account for the effects of masked and <b>unmasked</b> priming for identity and associatively related primes. The fits of the model led us to the following conclusion: Masked related primes give a head start to the processing of the target compared with unrelated primes, whereas <b>unmasked</b> priming affects primarily the quality of the lexical information...|$|R
5|$|On July 21, La Sombra and Rush were {{involved}} in an incident in Guadalajara, where the two attacked fans who were throwing beers at them. The following day, Jalisco's Boxing and Wrestling Commission suspended the two from wrestling in the state for three months. While the commission only suspended them from wrestling in Jalisco, CMLL decided to pull both La Sombra and Rush from their Super Viernes show three days later. CMLL did not offer an official explanation for the change. Over the summer of 2015 Los Ingobernables started to wrestle against tecnico teams instead of generally facing rudo teams {{as they had been}} up to that point. By August, 2015 Los Ingobernables found themselves facing off against Atlantis on multiple occasions, often with La Sombra going {{out of his way to}} attack Atlantis, tearing Atlantis' mask apart during matches to show his disdain for the veteran tecnico. On August 19, 2015 CMLL held a press conference where they announced that the winner of the main event of the 80th Anniversary, La Sombra, would put his mask on the line against the winner of the main event of the 81st Anniversary Show, Atlantis, in the main event of the CMLL 82nd Anniversary Show on September 18, 2015. On August 31, La Sombra lost the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship to Último Guerrero, ending his two and a half year reign. La Sombra lost the Lucha de Apuestas match to Atlantis. As a result, La Sombra was forced to <b>unmask</b> and reveal his real name. In early November, La Sombra and Rush began having issues with each other, which led to a singles match between the two on November 13, where Rush was victorious.

40|$|Since the French Revolution, {{intellectual}} and popular {{cultures of the}} West have been characterized by tropes of “unmasking,” a kind of exposure that purports to show mendacity and domination operating unseen {{beneath the surface of}} human affairs. Karl Mannheim was a particularly astute commentator on this phenomenon. His Ideology and Utopia (1929) and cognate writings offer an account of <b>unmasking</b> that is detailed, contextual, nuanced and critical. While he grants that <b>unmasking</b> was a condition of sociology’s emergence, Mannheim argues that it has outlived its usefulness for purposes of explanatory understanding. He further decries the destructive impact of <b>unmasking</b> on political discourse: an openly debunking attitude poisons the well of principled dialogue by claiming one’s interlocutor to be either a charlatan or a dupe of history. Critics such as Hannah Arendt and her mentor Karl Jaspers went further, condemning <b>unmasking</b> as execrable in principle and depicting sociology and psychology as major casualties of its rhetorical excesses – Mannheim’s sociology of knowledge included. This article describes Mannheim’s analysis of <b>unmasking,</b> the rhetorical moves he employed to move beyond the <b>unmasking</b> mode, and objections to his project of Jaspers and Arendt. Mannheim’s reception is muted today while Arendt’s is on a steadily rising curve of appreciation. But a reconstruction of Mannheim’s ideas on <b>unmasking</b> reveals an author who, at the time Arendt sparred with him, demonstrated a far greater comprehension than she did of the history and stakes of a topos that pervades modern thinking...|$|R
