500|$|Hardy's {{service in}} France lasted from July 1918 to July 1919, and {{included}} thirty-nine combat days. As an African American, {{he served in}} a segregated army unit, the 805th Pioneer Infantry, which was commanded by white officers. Although the unit's purpose was to [...] provide support for engineer regiments, {{it was also an}} infantry unit that was equipped to fight if necessary. The unit focused mainly of the tasks of stevedores, such as <b>unloading</b> <b>cargo</b> from ships, but also performed other manual labor tasks, such as cooking and organizing burials. Hardy's outfit was armed solely with rifles, instead of standard-issue machine guns. After the war, Hardy's division was responsible for cleaning up the battlefields and removing the dead.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after ten}} {{on the evening}} of 6 September, as the {{freighter}} [...] was continuing <b>unloading</b> <b>cargo</b> under her lights, the port came under fire from the Japanese cruiser Tenryū and the destroyer Arashi with Anshun receiving about ten hits from the cruiser and rolling onto her side. The Japanese ships also shelled shore positions at Gili Gili and Waga Waga and illuminated, but did not fire on, the hospital ship Manunda which was displaying her hospital ship colours and lights. The next night, two Japanese warships– a cruiser and a destroyer– bombarded Australian positions causing a number of casualties for 15 minutes before leaving the bay; it would be their final act in the battle. During the mopping up operations that followed, patrols by Australian troops tracked down and killed a number of Japanese troops who were attempting to trek overland to Buna.|$|E

2500|$|The December 26, 2015 {{arrival at}} the Port of Los Angeles {{marked the first time}} a ship of this size had been used in North America - {{previous}} routes for a ship this large were only from Asia to Northern Europe.

After departing Long Beach, she traveled north along the West Coast of the United States, arriving at the Port of Oakland near San Francisco on December 31, and at the Port of Seattle on February 29, 2016.

2500|$|The {{most notable}} changes were the {{addition}} of the McDonnell Douglas Advanced Aerial Refueling Boom (AARB) and additional fuel tanks located in the baggage compartments below the main deck. The extra tanks increase the KC-10's fuel capacity to 356,000lb (161,478kg), nearly doubling the KC-135's capacity. The KC-10 has both a centerline refueling boom — unique in that it sports a control surface system at its aft end that differs from the V-tail design used on previous tankers — and a drogue-and-hose system on the starboard side of the rear fuselage. The KC-10 boom operator is located {{in the rear of the}} aircraft with a wide window for monitoring refueling. The operator controls refueling operations through a digital fly-by wire system. Unlike the KC-135, the KC-10's hose-and-drogue system allows refueling of Navy, Marine Corps, and most allied aircraft, all in one mission. The final twenty KC-10s produced included wing-mounted pods for added refueling locations. In addition to its tanking role, the KC-10 can carry a complement 75 personnel with 146,000lb (66,225kg) of cargo, or 170,000lb (77,110kg) in an all-cargo configuration. [...] The KC-10 has a side cargo door for loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>cargo.</b> [...] Handling equipment is required to raise and lower loads to the cargo opening.|$|E
60|$|The other {{phase of}} the death-road {{was that of the}} {{habitual}} drunkards, who had a way of turning up their toes without apparent provocation. When they took sick, even with trifling afflictions that any ordinary man could pull through, they just pegged out.

50|$|Auxiliary crane {{ships are}} {{converted}} commercial container ships, equipped with pedestal cranes capable of lifting containers and other cargo.

50|$|Lift-on/lift-off or LoLo {{ships are}} cargo ships with {{on-board}} cranes to load and <b>unload</b> <b>cargo.</b> While the common abbreviation of lift-on/lift-off is LoLo, {{it is sometimes}} abbreviated as LOLO, LO/LO or Lo/Lo.
