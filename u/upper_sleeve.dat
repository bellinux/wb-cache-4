25|$|Under the new regulations, RLAF {{officers}} were now entitled {{to wear on}} their service or dress uniforms stiffened shoulder boards edged with gold braid identical to the standard RLA pattern, except that the colour was blue-grey instead of red. Junior officers added an appropriate number of five-pointed gold stars to their boards whilst NCOs wore chevrons on the <b>upper</b> <b>sleeve.</b> Airmen wore no insignia. However, these regulations were slowly implemented, {{and for a time}} US Air Force rank insignia were worn by RLAF personnel as an interim measure.|$|E
25|$|Badges of rank {{are usually}} worn on the epaulettes. However, when in formal uniform sergeants wear their rank {{insignia}} on their upper sleeves. When police tunics had closed collars (not open collars as worn with ties), constables and sergeants did not wear epaulettes but had their divisional call number on their collar (whence {{they are still}} {{often referred to as}} collar numbers). Sergeants wore their stripes on their <b>upper</b> <b>sleeve.</b> Inspectors and more senior ranks wore epaulettes at a much earlier stage, although they once wore their rank insignia on their collars. Most forces no longer use divisional call numbers, and retain only the collar number and rank insignia.|$|E

About halfway through the season, though, the player names made their appearance, since the Oilers had played exclusively in Edmonton. These jerseys also featured the player numbers high on the shoulders, {{rather than on the}} <b>upper</b> <b>sleeve.</b>|$|E
