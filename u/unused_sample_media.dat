If deepfryer oils are not managed appropriately, undesirable breakdown products accumulate. When 23 used oil <b>samples</b> and paired <b>unused</b> control oil <b>samples</b> from takeaway food outlets in north-eastern Australia were analysed for fatty acid profile and indicators of deterioration, oil identity and condition were found to differ greatly. Trans-fatty acid content was generally low, although one <b>unused</b> oil <b>sample</b> contained 43. 8 % (w/w). Two oil samples had polar compound contents above 25 %, the highest being 28. 7 %. Peroxide values and acid values, both singularly and in combination, correlated poorly with polar compound levels.

40|$|Rare earth {{elements}} (REEs) {{are quickly}} gaining {{more and more}} relevance as important chemical resources due to {{the large number of}} technical applications, and as a consequence, scientific interest on REE-bearing minerals is increasing. In this work, REE data from the FOREGS Geochemical Atlas of Europe database on solid <b>sample</b> <b>media</b> (topsoil, subsoil, stream sediment, and floodplain) and stream water for Italy and Sweden are used to plot distribution maps, and Principal Component Analysis to identify patterns within the data set. The careful investigation of the spatial distribution of REEs in all <b>sample</b> <b>media</b> for both countries allowed us to identify the prominent role played by the geogenic component. Despite a similar REE content of bedrocks (alkaline igneous products, both intrusive and effusive in Italy, alkali granites and pegmatites in Sweden), several distinct differences emerged between the two countries. We identified factors like climate, geomorphology, age of deposits, presence of mineralisation, types of soil and presence of till, as responsible for the different REE enrichments in solid and aqueous <b>sample</b> <b>media</b> in the two countries. Italian palaeosols, developed in volcanic areas, were identified as a possible future source for REE extraction using low pollutant extraction techniques...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Different <b>sampling</b> <b>media</b> (moss, lichen and attic dust) {{were used}} for {{monitoring}} the distribution of 15 elements, including certain trace elements, {{in the vicinity of}} an intensively exploited copper mine in the east of the Republic of Macedonia. Moss species (Hypnum cupressiforme and Campothecium lutescens), epiphytic lichens (Hypogymnia physodes and Evernia prunastri) and attic dust were collected for comparative analysis for monitoring air pollution. In both cases (lithological and anthropogenic affected areas) for the distribution of elements, the <b>sampling</b> <b>media</b> follows the expression capabilities: attic dust > moss > lichens. Enrichment factors M/L—moss vs. lichen, for plant response to elements distribution and D/L—attic dust vs. lichen, for historical response of elements distribution were significant for Cu and Ni, which were singled out as the main markers for anthropogenic and geogenic distribution. The factor analysis highlighted geogenic (F 1 : Ni-Cr-Cd-Fe-Al-K-Mn-Zn) and anthropogenic (F 2 : As-Cu-Pb) association of elements from three types of <b>media</b> <b>samples.</b> For anthropogenic affected areas, T value and F value for Cu content were significant at p < 0. 05 and higher enrichment factors were obtained for lichen, moss and attic dust media (3. 8, 5. 0 and 5. 7, respectively). Spatial distribution for element deposition (with emphasis on Cu and Ni) is not disturbed by the significant differences in the <b>sampling</b> <b>media</b> matrix. Treated <b>sample</b> materials (attic dust, moss, lichen) are shown to be useful in determining an anthropogenic impact, as well as the chemical properties or geological background on orographic diverse terrain in the presence of complex geological structure...|$|R

40|$|In most {{water quality}} {{monitoring}} programs, either filtered water (dissolved) or suspended sediment (either whole water or separated suspended sediment) are the traditional <b>sample</b> <b>media</b> of choice.

The usual rationale is that bed sediment chemistry does not provide the temporal immediacy that can be obtained using more traditional <b>sample</b> <b>media</b> (e. g., suspended sediment, water). However, despite the issue of temporal immediacy, bed sediments can be used to address/identify certain types of water quality problems and could be employed more frequently for that purpose.

Penetration of sodium chloride particles varied from 1. 9 to 18 % at 15 l. min− 1 for the six filters.

40|$|Actuators {{used on the}} United States {{space shuttle}} fleet are {{lubricated}} with unspecified amounts of Braycote 601 (Castrol Braycote) grease consisting of a perfluoropolyalkyl ether (PFPAE) base oil thickened with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filler. Each shuttle has four body flap actuators (BFAs) (two on each wing) on a common segmented shaft and four rudder speed brake (RSB) actuators. The actuators were designed to operate for 10 years and 100 flights without periodic relubrication. Visible inspection of two partially disassembled RSB actuators in continuous use for 19 years raised concerns over possible grease degradation due to discoloration of the grease on several places on the surfaces of the gears. Inspection revealed fretting, micropitting, wear and corrosion of the bearings and gears. A small amount of oil dripped from the disassembled actuators. Whereas new grease is beige in appearance, the discolored grease consisted of both grey and reddish colors. Grease samples taken from the actuators together with representative off-the-shelf new and <b>unused</b> grease <b>samples</b> were analyzed by gravimetry for oil content; by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP) for metals content; Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for base oil decomposition; and by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) for determination of the molecular weight distributions of the grease oil. The Braycote 601 grease was stable after 19 years of continuous use in the sealed RSB actuators and was fit for its intended purpose. There were no significant chemical differences between the used grease samples and new and <b>unused</b> <b>samples.</b> Base oil separation was not significant within the sealed actuators.
