40|$|Does {{neoliberalism}} {{matter for}} cities, <b>urbanization</b> <b>processes,</b> urban governance and policies? How {{and to what}} extent? What does this even mean? These questions are important as neoliberalism is a contentious and powerful political project and paradigm. This paper argues that: (1) it may be fruitful to be clearer {{about the meaning of}} neoliberalism rather than adopting an encompassing constructivist framework; and (2) that neoliberalism may not explain that much about the current transformation of <b>urbanization</b> <b>processes</b> and cities. Instead, these mechanisms need to be better specified and their limits defined: urban worlds and the <b>urbanization</b> <b>processes</b> of cities do not change all the time, in all ways. Rather than embracing the multiple, ever-changing forms of neoliberalism and the contructivist framework underpinning this position, this paper identifies a set of central points to define neoliberalism by contrast to liberalism, as one possible working definition of neoliberalism. Secondly, it discusses the neoliberalization of cities and urban policies, recognizing that cities change for many reasons, of which neoliberalism is just one. [Résumé éditeur...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCultural landscapes can be {{interpreted}} as geographical spaces with high sensitivity. The pressure of urbanization, or alternatively, the abandonment of wide rural areas as a secondary consequence of the same <b>process</b> of <b>urbanization,</b> in these high fragility territories determines serious environmental crises. The high density of values, such as landscape (natural or man-made) quality of landscapes, ecosystem services production, concentrated presence of resources, is constantly threatened not only by climate change but also above all by the same <b>urbanization</b> <b>processes.</b> It can talk about ‘landscape risk’ when these <b>urbanization</b> <b>processes</b> determine changes that cause loss of identity of landscape values. Here, resilience is the ability of an ecosystem (or more precisely, a socio-ecological system) to adapt by virtuous change its internal relations and maintaining the identity values. The paper explores the potential of a method of analysis and evaluation in which, starting from the recognition of the heritage elements, the system of values are compared with the conditions of risk and degradation (due to environmental and man-made drivers) with the result of building maps of vulnerability and resilience...|$|R

40|$|Most {{urban areas}} of {{developing}} countries were hitherto experiencing unprecedented growth in their population, the phenomenon {{commonly referred to as}} urbanization, which in this study can be said to be the proportion of urban population relative to the total population of a region. This phenomenon has opportunities vis-à-vis challenges, whose impact on natural resources in general and water resources in particular, cannot be over- emphasized. It is within the context of these urban challenges that this study attempts to look into and possibly assess the situation in the urban and peri- urban areas of Kumasi Metropolitan Area (KMA) in Ghana, whose <b>urbanization</b> <b>processes</b> is prejudiced by this study to be increasing rapidly. The study specifically attempted to assess thechanges in the urbanization patterns and the possible future urbanization trend of the area within a specific time frame. The study also attempts to look at the causes of this urbanization, and its impact on water resources in the Area, both qualitatively and quantitatively, envisaged to be the results of socio-economic activities taking place in the Area. Finally, the study attempts to look into the measures put in place to curb these challenges. Amid paucity of data, however, the study reveals that the most single contributor of <b>urbanization</b> <b>processes</b> in the area has been migration from the countryside, and in particular from {{the northern part of the}} country. The study also reveals the fact that even though the general quality standard of some water resources is better, the largely uncontrolled socio-economic activities, coupled with the deplorable sanitary conditions in the KMA, has potential to degrade the water resources in the KMA. In addition, the study reveals that little attention is given, in terms of policy formulation to curb this <b>urbanization</b> <b>processes</b> and to protect water resources in the area...|$|R
