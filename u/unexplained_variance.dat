In order to understand this, it is necessary to understand the test used to evaluate differences between groups, the F-test.

Thus, [...] F = If this value is larger than a critical value, we conclude that there is a significant difference between groups. <b>Unexplained</b> <b>variance</b> includes error variance (e.g., individual differences), as well as the influence of other factors.

50|$|Omnibus {{tests are}} {{a kind of}} {{statistical}} test. They test whether the explained variance in a set of data is significantly greater than the <b>unexplained</b> <b>variance,</b> overall. One example is the F-test in the analysis of variance. There can be legitimate significant effects within a model even if the omnibus test is not significant. For instance, in a model with two independent variables, if only one variable exerts a significant effect on the dependent variable and the other does not, then the omnibus test may be non-significant. This fact does not affect the conclusions that may be drawn from the one significant variable. In order to test effects within an omnibus test, researchers often use contrasts.|$|E
5000|$|While the {{saturated}} {{model is}} a model with a theoretically perfect fit. Given that deviance {{is a measure of}} the difference between a given model and the saturated model, smaller values indicate better fit as the fitted model deviates less from the saturated model. When assessed upon a chi-square distribution, non-significant chi-square values indicate very little <b>unexplained</b> <b>variance</b> and thus, good model fit. Conversely, a significant chi-square value indicates that a significant amount of the variance is unexplained. Two measures of deviance D are particularly important in logistic regression: null deviance and model deviance. The null deviance represents the difference between a model with only the intercept and no predictors and the saturated model. And, the model deviance represents the difference between a model with at least one predictor and the saturated model.3 In this respect, the null model provides a baseline upon which to compare predictor models. Therefore, to assess the contribution of a predictor or set of predictors, one can subtract the model deviance from the null deviance and assess the difference on a chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom. If the model deviance is significantly smaller than the null deviance then one can conclude that the predictor or set of predictors significantly improved model fit. This is analogous to the F-test used in linear regression analysis to assess the significance of prediction. In most cases, the exact distribution of the likelihood ratio corresponding to specific hypotheses is very difficult to determine. A convenient result, attributed to Samuel S. Wilks, says that as the sample size n approaches the test statistic has asymptotically distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in dimensionality of and parameters the β coefficients as mentioned before on the omnibus test. e.g., if n is large enough and if the fitted model assuming the null hypothesis consist of 3 predictors and the saturated ( [...] full [...] ) model consist of 5 predictors, the Wilks' statistic is approximately distributed ( [...] with 2 degrees of freedom). This means that we can retrieve the critical value C from the chi squared with 2 degrees of freedom under a specific significance level.|$|E

This study developed from a concern about the relationship between occupational stress and three categories of selected variables descriptive of high school principals: personality, demographic, and situational. Although a review of related literature provided little evidence of research on stress of principals, it did provide extensive evidence of existing relationships between occupational stress and variables descriptive of workers in other occupations. The study generated data relative to the following specific question: What relationships exist among principals' occupational stress and self-concept, self-esteem, work motivation, age, educational attainment, and school location?The criterion variable, occupational stress, was measured by a scale developed by Kahn et al. in 1964. Three of the predictor variables, self-concept, self-esteem, and work motivation, were measured by personality factors identified in Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Form Y- 1977) and Sales' Short Type A Behavior Scale as modified by Caplan and Vickers. These scales, along with six, single-item demographic and situational measures, comprised the 50 -item questionnaire that was administered to 325 Illinois high school principals. The data were submitted to multiple regression analysis using an alpha level of. 01. The following conclusions resulted: (1) High school principals report a moderate level of occupational stress: 2. 38 on a 4 -point scale.
