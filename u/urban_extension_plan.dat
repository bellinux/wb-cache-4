40|$|This {{research}} work {{deals with the}} problem of karst sinkhole collapse occurring {{in the last few years}} in Cheria area. This newly revealed phenomenon is of a major constrain in land use planning and urbanization, it has become necessary to assess the stability of these underground features before any planning operation. Laboratory testing and field work were undertaken in order to determine both intact rock and rock mass properties. All the rock mechanics testing and measurement were undertaken according to the ISRM recommendations. It has been found that under imposed loading, the stability of the karst cavities depends on the geo-mechanical parameters (Rock Masse Rating; RMR, Geological Strength Index; GSI, and Young Modulus; E) of the host rock as well as the depth and dimensions of the gallery. It increases with RMR, GSI, E and depth and decreases as the cavity becomes wider. Furthermore, the calculation results show that a ratio (roof thickness to gallery width) of 0. 3 and more indicate, a stable conditions. The results obtained in this work allow identifying and assessing the stability of underground karst cavities. The methodology followed in this paper can be taken as a road map in the establishment of a hazard map related to the studied phenomenon. This map will be a useful tool for the future <b>urban</b> <b>extension</b> <b>planning</b> in Cherea area...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article was to explore the concept of <b>urban</b> <b>Extension</b> as {{perceived}} by Extension agents within the Tampa Bay area, one of Florida’s fastest growing metropolitan areas. From a theoretical perspective, it is critical to understand Extension agents’ beliefs about <b>urban</b> <b>Extension</b> because behaviors are directly related to attitudes (Ajzen, 2012). In 2016, a qualitative investigation was undertaken to explore the perspectives of 23 agents working within the Tampa Bay area. Results showed the majority of agents believed that context and client needs are unique for <b>urban</b> <b>Extension,</b> and that to a lesser extent, unique agent expertise is required. Further, these beliefs impacted how agents reported their approach to programming, with an emphasis on providing convenience and seeking partnerships. Difficulties were identified related to identifying the role of Extension in a resource-rich environment of service providers, which contributed to the existence of a perceived disconnect between <b>urban</b> audiences and <b>Extension.</b> Opportunities exist for Extension leadership to provide strategic organizational support that will enhance agents’ abilities to succeed in the metropolitan environment...|$|R

Research and practice shared in this issue {{can be used by}} Extension leaders at all levels to support decision making as they evaluate investment priorities to advance the <b>Extension</b> mission in <b>urban</b> communities. Community and campus-based Extension professionals can evaluate past, current, and future scenarios. Diverse stakeholders engaged with urban community priorities can adopt or adapt approaches and examples presented; they can also connect with Extension to establish collaborative relationships to address urban issues.
