40|$|The Bachelor Thesis {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} {{existing}} <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>weir</b> on the river Svitava in district Brno-Obřany. The first part of the Thesis contains a theoretical part about theme of weirs. In the next part Thesis describes {{the current state of the}} area of interest, including the riverbed of Svitavy with neighboring objects. After that the Thesis describes the design of the reconstruction, including the selection of suitable movable construction and procedure of hydrotechnical calculations. In conclusion, a calculation of the stability of the design was described...|$|E
40|$|The Bachelor Thesis {{deals with}} the design of rekonstruction of the <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>weir</b> ´´Kamenny mlyn“ on the river Svratka to a new gate weir structure. The first part focuses on teoretical intro and the {{processing}} of data on the area of interest and the selection of appropriate design solution for {{the reconstruction of the}} weir, where there are described several types of movable gate. At the end of this part the current condition of the buildings and the channel of the Svratka river in the area of interest is evaluated. In the second part, the Thesis {{deals with the}} design of the gate weir structure and its subsequent assessment. At first, the solid substructure and the height of the gate is designed and assessed. Subsequently, the stilling basin is designed and in conclusion, the overall stability of the designed structure is assessed...|$|E
5000|$|The dam is a {{concrete}} arch-gravity dam, 70 ft wide {{at the base}} and 200 ft wide at the crest, with an original height of 325 ft. The concrete structure measures 108 ft deep at the base, tapering to 10 ft at the crest, with a volume of [...] of concrete. It is anchored into Pre-Cambrian granitic rock on either side. The spillway is an <b>uncontrolled</b> overflow <b>weir</b> on the south side, 298 ft wide, dropping through a tunnel in the left abutment.|$|R
5000|$|Riverside Diversion Dam is the {{lowermost}} dam of the Rio Grande Project. The dam is 8 ft {{above the}} streambed, 17.5 ft above its foundations, and 267 ft long. Its service spillway consists of six 16 ftx8.17 ft radial gates, and an <b>uncontrolled</b> overflow <b>weir</b> {{serves as an}} emergency spillway. The Riverside Canal carries water 17.2 mi to the El Paso Valley, and has a capacity of about [...] The Tornillo Canal, with a capacity of , branches 12 mi off the Riverside Canal. Excess waters from the canals are diverted to irrigate about 18000 acre in Hudspeth County, Texas.|$|R
5000|$|Over {{the top of}} an {{emergency}} spillway, consisting of a 1730 ft long, 30 ft high concrete weir beside the main spillway and the adjacent earthen slope of the abutment. Once the lake reaches an elevation of 901 ft above mean sea level—21 ft below {{the height of the}} main dam structure—water flows, <b>uncontrolled,</b> over the <b>weir</b> and down the earthen slope until it reaches the river below.|$|R
50|$|In {{the midst}} of {{widespread}} rainfall during the 2017 California floods, damage to the dam's main spillway appeared on February 7, resulting in its closure as management tried to assess the extent of damage and ways to mitigate further damage. As storms dumped significant precipitation on the area, the lake level rose until it flowed over a concrete weir {{at the top of}} the dam's emergency spillway, despite the reopening of the damaged main spillway. As water flowed <b>uncontrolled</b> over the <b>weir,</b> headward erosion of the emergency spillway threatened to undermine and collapse the concrete weir, which could have sent a 30-foot (9 m) wall of water into the Feather River below and flooded communities downstream. A collapse never occurred, but the main spillway suffered significant damage and the bare slope of the emergency spillway was significantly eroded.|$|R
