5|$|The {{broad bean}} weevil, B. rufimanus is <b>univoltine.</b> It reproduces in spring in faba bean crops, lays eggs {{on the young}} pods, {{develops}} in the growing seeds and overwinters as adults in shelters, or in diapause as larva or pupa diapause in the stored seeds.|$|E
5|$|Most ants are <b>univoltine,</b> {{producing}} {{a new generation}} each year. During the species-specific breeding period, new reproductives, females, and winged males leave the colony in {{what is called a}} nuptial flight. The nuptial flight usually takes place in the late spring or early summer when the weather is hot and humid. Heat makes flying easier and freshly fallen rain makes the ground softer for mated queens to dig nests. Males typically take flight before the females. Males then use visual cues to find a common mating ground, for example, a landmark such as a pine tree to which other males in the area converge. Males secrete a mating pheromone that females follow. Males will mount females in the air, but the actual mating process usually takes place on the ground. Females of some species mate with just one male but in others they may mate with as many as ten or more different males, storing the sperm in their spermathecae.|$|E
5|$|Nothomyrmecia queens are brachypterous, {{meaning that}} they have stubby {{rudimentary}} wings that render them flightless. This may correlate with population structure, possibly as an adaptation in small populated colonies or by unusual ecological requirements. The alates may begin to emerge in late summer and early autumn (March or April), and colony-founding queens excavate to considerable depths underground; queens start to lay eggs by spring. Queens are <b>univoltine</b> and only produce a single generation of ants annually, and eggs may take 12 months to fully develop. When a colony is mature, only 50 to 100 individuals are present in each nest. In some colonies, colony founding can occur within a colony itself when a queen dies, taken over by one of her daughters. This method of colony founding may render a nest immortal.|$|E
5|$|The pupal cocoon is spun from silk, {{but like}} the larval case, often has other {{materials}} attached. When pupating, species that build portable cases attach them to some underwater object, seal {{the front and back}} apertures against predators while still allowing water to flow through, and pupate within it. Once fully developed, most pupal caddisflies cut through their cases with a special pair of mandibles, swim up to the water surface, moult using the exuviae as a floating platform, and emerge as fully formed adults. They can often fly immediately after breaking from their pupal cuticle. Emergence is mainly <b>univoltine</b> (once per year) with all the adults of a species emerging at the same time. Development is within a year in warm places, but takes over a year in high latitudes and at high elevation in mountain lakes and streams.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of insects hatch from eggs. The fertilization and development takes place inside the egg, enclosed by a shell (chorion) {{that consists of}} maternal tissue. In contrast to eggs of other arthropods, most insect eggs are drought resistant. This is because inside the chorion two additional membranes develop from embryonic tissue, the amnion and the serosa. This serosa secretes a cuticle rich in chitin that protects the embryo against desiccation. In Schizophora however the serosa does not develop, but these flies lay their eggs in damp places, such as rotting matter. Some species of insects, like the cockroach Blaptica dubia, as well as juvenile aphids and tsetse flies, are ovoviviparous. The eggs of ovoviviparous animals develop entirely inside the female, and then hatch immediately upon being laid. Some other species, {{such as those in}} the genus of cockroaches known as Diploptera, are viviparous, and thus gestate inside the mother and are born alive. Some insects, like parasitic wasps, show polyembryony, where a single fertilized egg divides into many and in some cases thousands of separate embryos. Insects may be <b>univoltine,</b> bivoltine or multivoltine, i.e. they may have one, two or many broods (generations) in a year.|$|E
25|$|Integrodifference {{equations}} are a form {{of recurrence}} relation important to spatial ecology. These and other difference equations are particularly suited to modeling <b>univoltine</b> populations.|$|E
25|$|The Utah valvata snail is <b>univoltine</b> (produces {{one group}} of eggs per year) with a {{lifespan}} of about 1 year. Reproduction and spawning occur asynchronously between March and October, depending on habitat, {{with the majority of}} young spawned between August and October.|$|E
25|$|In {{southern}} Europe, subspecies M. a. celadussa {{flies in}} a single brood at high altitude in June and July. Below the subalpine level, however, it is bivoltine, flying in May–June and late July–August—except for f. nevadensis in the Sierra Nevada, which is <b>univoltine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Solifugae are {{typically}} <b>univoltine.</b> Reproduction can involve {{direct or indirect}} sperm transfer; when indirect, the male emits a spermatophore {{on the ground and}} then inserts it with his chelicerae in the female's genital pore. To do this, he flings the female on her back.|$|E
25|$|In Great Britain and Ireland, the {{peppered}} moth is <b>univoltine</b> (i.e., {{it has one}} generation per year), whilst in south-eastern North America it is bivoltine (two generations per year). The lepidopteran life cycle consists of four stages: ova (eggs), several larval instars (caterpillars), pupae, which overwinter live in the soil, and imagines (adults). During the day, the moths typically rest on trees, where they are preyed on by birds.|$|E
2500|$|Mulberry {{silkworms}} can {{be categorized}} into three different but connected groups or types. The major groups of silkworms fall under the <b>univoltine</b> ("uni-"=one, [...] "voltine"=brood frequency) and bivoltine categories. The <b>univoltine</b> breed is generally linked with the geographical area within greater Europe. The eggs of this type hibernate during winter due to the cold climate, and cross-fertilize only by spring, generating silk only once annually. The second type is called bivoltine and is normally found in China, Japan, and Korea. The breeding process of this type takes place twice annually, a feat made possible through the slightly warmer climates and the resulting two life cycles. The polyvoltine type of mulberry silkworm can only {{be found in the}} tropics. The eggs are laid by female moths and hatch within nine to 12 days, so the resulting type can have up to eight separate life cycles throughout the year.|$|E
2500|$|In Portugal and north-west Spain, M. a. celadussa f. biedermanni Querci {{is larger}} than typical M. a. celadussa, with finer black lines in the outer half of the wing, but a thicker discal line; {{transitional}} forms occur in central west Spain. In Sierra Nevada, f. nevadensis Verity is golden yellow with fine black markings (it is also <b>univoltine,</b> whereas typical M. a. celadussa is bivoltine at low altitude). In [...] "southern" [...] Europe, f. tenuicola Verity occurs in late broods—it is small and its black markings reduced.|$|E
2500|$|These larvae {{feed upon}} many common trees and shrubs, {{including}} maple, birch, and apple. As they grow larger, {{it becomes clear}} that the black color is actually small black hairs growing from tubercles (small projections) all over the body, which at early stages is yellow-green. As the larvae grow, the coloration becomes green to bluish-green, with the tubercles becoming blue, yellow or orange, depending on body location, while the black hairs are eventually lost. [...] Upon reaching maturity in Autumn, the caterpillars, now [...] 4 to 4.5 inches long, spin large cocoons on trees or wooden structures to emerge as adults in {{the first two weeks of}} seasonally warm weather in early Summer. Hyalophora cecropia moths are <b>univoltine,</b> having only one generation per year.|$|E
2500|$|Some saturniids are {{strictly}} <b>univoltine,</b> producing only one generation a year, whereas others are multivoltine, producing {{more than one}} brood a year. Spring and summer broods hatch {{in a matter of}} weeks; autumn broods enter a state known as diapause and emerge the following spring. How the pupae know when to hatch early or hibernate is not yet fully understood, though research suggests day length during the larval fifth instar plays a major role, as well as cooling temperatures. Longer days may prompt pupae to develop early, while shorter days result in pupal diapause. The number of broods is flexible, and a single female may produce both fast-developing and slow-developing individuals, or they may produce different numbers of broods in different years or parts of the range. In some species [...] e.g. the luna moth (Actias luna) or Callosamia securifera (both [...] Saturniinae) , spring and summer broods look different, with different genes activated by environmental conditions.|$|E
