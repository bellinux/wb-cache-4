5|$|From 1993 {{to early}} 1996, {{although}} Sega's revenue declined {{as part of}} an industry-wide slowdown, the company retained control of 38% of the U.S. video game market (compared to Nintendo's 30% and Sony's 24%). 800,000 PlayStation units were sold in the U.S. by the end of 1995, compared to 400,000 Saturn units. In part due to an aggressive price war, the PlayStation outsold the Saturn by two-to-one in 1996, while Sega's 16-bit sales declined markedly. By the end of 1996, the PlayStation had sold 2.9 million units in the <b>U.S.,</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> twice the 1.2 million units sold by the Saturn. After the launch of the Nintendo 64 in 1996, sales of the Saturn and Sega's 32-bit software were sharply reduced, while the PlayStation outsold the Saturn by three-to-one in the U.S. market in 1997. The 1997 release of Final Fantasy VII significantly increased the PlayStation's popularity in Japan. As of August 1997, Sony controlled 47% of the console market, Nintendo controlled 40%, and Sega controlled only 12%. Neither price cuts nor high-profile game releases were proving helpful to the Saturn's success. Reflecting decreased demand for the system, worldwide Saturn shipments during March to September 1997 declined from 2.35 million to 600,000 versus the same period in 1996; shipments in North America declined from 800,000 to 50,000. Due to the Saturn's poor performance in North America, 60 of Sega of America's 200 employees were laid off in the fall of 1997.|$|E

25|$|The {{problem with}} the output from a single wind farm located in any {{particular}} region {{is that it is}} variable on time scales ranging from minutes to days posing difficulties for incorporating relevant outputs into an integrated power system. The high frequency (shorter than once per day) variability of contributions from individual wind farms is determined mainly by locally generated small scale boundary layer. The low frequency variability (longer than once per day) is associated with the passage of transient waves in the atmosphere with a characteristic time scale of several days. The high frequency variability of wind-generated power can be significantly reduced by coupling outputs from 5 to 10 wind farms distributed uniformly over a ten state region of the Central <b>US.</b> <b>More</b> <b>than</b> 95% of the remaining variability of the coupled system is concentrated at time scales longer than a day, allowing operators to take advantage of multi-day weather forecasts in scheduling projected contributions from wind.|$|E

[...] Even Harrison's loyal [...] "disciples", Schaffner continued, tended to view the album as [...] "plodding and aimless". Rolling Stones reviewer, Dave Marsh, highlighted [...] "You" [...] as a return to All Things Must Pass-style grandeur, and [...] "Can't Stop Thinking About You" [...] and [...] "Tired of Midnight Blue" [...] as [...] "the most effective nine minutes of music" [...] the artist had made since 1970. Generally, on an album that was [...] "sketchy at best", however, Marsh bemoaned the over-reliance on [...] "merely competent" [...] keyboards and Harrison's [...] "affectingly feeble voice", before concluding: [...] "Harrison {{is no longer a}} Beatle, as he has reminded <b>us</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> we have asked.

Stern concluded by saying that he [...] "thought this would be much worse because the concept is so flimsy, but I have to say: It's kind of a treat to see Madonna letting loose and having some fun."

[...] In a different perspective, Joan Anderman of Boston.com remarked that [...] "Breakaway" [...] is not new or exciting-sounding but he admitted that the [...] "hit single accomplishes the rare feat of being thoroughly middle-of-the-road without sacrificing grace or intelligence". Chuck Taylor of Billboard felt that the song was a weak choice as a single compared to Clarkson's previous hits, writing Breakaway' sounds more like an Irish folk song propped up with pop production than the anthemic material with which Clarkson has won over legions of fans." [...] Kathi Kamen Goldmark of Disney Family.com felt that the song was tedious, simultaneously dull and so emotionally overwrought that it almost sounds like a parody of itself. Michael Wood of The Village Voice described the song as [...] "a swoony acoustic folk-pop that Goo Goo Doll Johnny Rzeznik would trade his hair gel for".

E'Jon Moore of The Christian Manifesto gave the album three out of five stars, saying [...] "In the end, Move is a good album. It’s not a great album...
