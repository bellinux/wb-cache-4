30|$|The {{bacterial}} {{population and the}} pigment production is estimated by measuring absorbance of the culture using a spectro-photometer (UV- 1700 <b>UV-VIS</b> <b>Spectro-photometer)</b> at different wavelengths (350 - 700 [nm]). Measurements are taken each one hour during lag phase and every 30 minutes in the exponential phase. For each measurement an aliquot of liquid culture is taken and the absorbance is determined every 50 [nm] (between 350 and 700 [nm]).|$|E
40|$|Two new ether {{substituted}} azodyes were synthesized and {{characterized by}} different spectral analysis such as 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, FTIR and UV/Vis. Synthesized compounds {{were used to}} study the photoisomerization phenomenon by using <b>UV–Vis</b> <b>spectro-photometer.</b> Interesting polarity dependent effect is observed {{for the first time}} on these materials. Trans–cis (E–Z) and cis–trans (Z–E) conversion occurred within 41 s and 445 min, respectively for both the compounds in solutions. Polarizing optical microscopy studies revealed that there is no liquid crystal phase for both the compounds. The dramatic variation in the optical property is speculated to be the polarity of the chemical species. These derivatives are useful to fabricate optical data storage devices...|$|E
40|$|The II-VI group {{semiconductors}} are {{of great}} importance due to their applications in various opto electronic devices. Among these semiconductor. Zinc sulphide is the most suitable for its utility in opto electronic devices. Zinc Sulphide has been prepared on glass substrate by using Spray Pyrolysis method. The optical properties of these films have been studied in the wavelength range 380 - 1000 -nm using <b>UV-VIS</b> <b>spectro-photometer.</b> The ZnS films has a direct band gap of 3. 47 eV- 3. 54 eV. The thickness of these films were determined by weighing method and {{in the range of}} 0. 2120 µm- 0. 2543. µm The structure of the prepared films was studied from X-ray diffraction pattern, the results shows that the film was polycrystalline with hexagonal structure...|$|E
30|$|The X-ray {{diffraction}} (XRD) {{measurements were}} carried out by a polycrystalline X-ray diffractometer (XPERT-PRO, PANalytical B.V., The Netherlands) under room temperature with Cu Kα radiation, and the scanning angle ranged from 5 ° to 90 ° of 2 θ. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a FTIR spectrophotometer (BRUKER Model-Alpha, BrukerOptikGmbh, Ettlingen, Germany) with ATR Technique. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken using a transmission electron microscope (Philips-CM 200 TEM, Chalmaers, Gothenburg, Sweden). Scanning electron microscope images and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were taken with a JEOL-JSM- 5200 microscope (JEOL Ltd., Akishima, Tokyo, Japan). The UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with an <b>UV–vis</b> <b>spectro-photometer</b> (ShimadzuUV- 1800, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu RF- 5301 PC spectroflurophotometer, and a 450 [*]W Xe-lamp {{was used as the}} excitation source.|$|E
40|$|Zinc sulfide (ZnS) is {{important}} II-VI semiconductors {{material for the}} development of various modern technologies and photovoltaic applications. ZnS thin film was prepared by using chemical spray pyrolysis technique. The starting solution is a mixture of 0. 1 M zinc chloride as source of Zn and 0. 05 M thiourea as source of S. The glass substrate temperature was varied in the range of 300 °C- 400 °C to investigate the influence of substrate temperature on the structure, chemical composition, morphological and optical properties of ZnS films. The DRX analyses indicated that ZnS films have polycrystalline cubic structure with (111) preferential orientation and grain size varied from 25 to 60 nm, increasing with substrate temperature.
