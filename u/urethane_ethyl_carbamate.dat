40|$|A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER of {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} chemical and radiation carcinogenesis can be inhibited by various agents (Wattenberg et al., 1977). Nomura 1976, 1978, 1980) found that after-treatment with caffeine suppressed lung tumorigenesis induced in mice by either 4 nitroquinoline-l-oxide (4 NQO) or urethane, supporting the hypothesis of Kondo (1971, 1977) that caffeine may suppress 4 NQOinduced carcinogenesis in mice {{in a similar way}} to the diminution of 4 NQO-induced mutagenesis in Escherichia coli by inhibition of misrepair in DNA. If this hypothesis is applied to other antimutagens, antipain [(l-carboxy- 2 -phenylethyl) carbamoyl-L-arginyl-L-valyl-arginal] (Fig. 1) may also inhibit chemical carcinogenesis, since antipain has been reported to be antimutagenic to mutagenesis in E. coli by UV (Meyn et al., 1977) and by 4 NQO (Ichikawa-Ryo & Kondo, 1980). This paper deals with the effects of after-treatment with antipain on lung neoplasia induced by urethane in mice.

Urethane exposure, in both high and low doses, increased the incidence of Ki-ras mutations in lung tumors, especially in adenomas. The presence of Ki-ras gene mutations in very small urethane-induced lung tumors and the absence of hyperplasias among the treated-group lesions may indicate that urethane accelerates tumoral progression. No p 53 mutations were detected in exons 5 - 8 in any of the epithelium-derived lung tumors. Only one p 53 mutation in exon 5 was found in a spontaneous lymphoma.

40|$|Background: Lung {{cancer is}} {{a leading cause of}} cancer death. There has been found a {{substantial}} gap in the understanding of lung cancer genesis at the molecular level.

There might be many molecules involved, but we subsequently emphasized here the study of alternation in the expression of NF- κB, Stat 3, and inflammatory cytokines interleukin- 1 β and interleukin- 6 to hypothesize that the microenvironment created by these molecules is promoting tumor formation. Materials and Methods: 7 - 8 week old Balb/c mice of either sex were given intraperitoneal (i. p.) injection of urethane (1 g/kgbw) for eight consecutive weeks. Histopathological analysis was done to detect abnormality or invasions occurred in the lung tissues. Automated cell counter was used to count the number of inflammatory cells. The expression of NF-κB, Stat 3, and IL- 1 β was observed at translational level by western blot, while the expression of IL- 1 β and IL- 6 was observed at transcriptional level by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. Secretion of IL- 1 β and IL- 6 in the blood was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method at different time intervals. Results: Histopathological analysis showed various lung cancer stages hyperplasia, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, and adenocarcinoma. Increased population of inflammatory cells, persistant expression of NF-κB, Stat 3, pStat 3, and IL- 1 β at translational level, while at transcriptional level constitutive enhanced expression of IL- 1 β and IL- 6 followed by increased secretion of IL- 1 β and IL- 6 in the blood were observed in urethane-injected mice in comparison to phosphate buffer saline (PBS) injected mice at 12, 24, and 36 weeks.

Advances in detection methods have lead {{to the discovery of}} many compounds in wines, such as <b>ethyl</b> <b>carbamate,</b> that could be harmful to humans. This naturally occurring compound is considered potentially dangerous to humans, as it exhibits carcinogenic activity in a variety of laboratory animals; degradation products of this compound bind covalently to DNA and subse-quently induce mutations (Bartsch et al. 1994, Hübner et al. 1997, Leithauser et al. 1990, Schlatter and Lutz 1990). <b>Ethyl</b> <b>carbamate</b> can be found in many fermented foods and beverages in the μg/L or μg/kg range (Canas et al. 1989, Ough 1976, Wittkowski 1997), and consumption of alcoholic beverages can substantially increase daily expo-sure to <b>ethyl</b> <b>carbamate</b> (Zimmerli and Schlatter 1991).
