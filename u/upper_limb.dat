40|$|The use of PCs {{can cause}} health problems, {{including}} musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) of the <b>upper</b> <b>limbs.</b> This study {{was performed to}} investigate whether using PCs in PC game rooms may induce MSDs of the <b>upper</b> <b>limbs.</b> 284 young male Koreans were included. A self-administered, structured questionnaire was used to gather information about game room use, perceived subjective stress, and the symptoms related to MSDs. Urinary concentrations of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine were measured in spot urine. The symptom prevalence of MSDs of the <b>upper</b> <b>limbs</b> increased according to the increase of the duration of game room use. The intensity of perceived subjective stress showed a significant dose-response relationship with the frequency of MSDs symptoms in neck and shoulder areas. However, the urinary level of catecholamines was not significantly correlated with the symptom prevalence of MSDs in the <b>upper</b> <b>limbs.</b> These findings suggest that using PCs in game rooms produce physical stress on the <b>upper</b> <b>limbs,</b> strong enough to induce MSDs...|$|R

25|$|The Test to Measure <b>Upper</b> <b>Limb</b> Apraxia (TULIA) is {{one method}} of {{determining}} <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> apraxia through the {{qualitative and quantitative}} assessment of gesture production. In contrast to previous publications on apraxic assessment, {{the reliability and validity}} of TULIA was thoroughly investigated. The TULIA consists of subtests for the imitation and pantomime of non-symbolic (“put your index finger on top of your nose”), intransitive (“wave goodbye”) and transitive (“show me how to use a hammer”) gestures. Discrimination (differentiating between well- and poorly performed tasks) and recognition (indicating which object corresponds to a pantomimed gesture) tasks are also often tested for a full apraxia evaluation.|$|E

25|$|Reconstructive surgery of the <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> in tetraplegic {{patients}} began {{during the}} mid-20th century. The ﬁrst attempts at regaining gripping {{function of the}} hand probably took place in Europe {{at the end of}} the 1920s with the construction of ﬂexor-hinge splints.|$|E
25|$|As well as medication, {{rehabilitation}} programmes {{and surgical}} interventions, {{the application of}} biomechanical loading on tremor movement {{has been shown to}} be a technique that is able to suppress the effects of tremor on the human body. It has been established in the literature that most of the different types of tremor respond to biomechanical loading. In particular, it has been clinically tested that the increase of damping and/or inertia in the <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> leads to a reduction of the tremorous motion. Biomechanical loading relies on an external device that either passively or actively acts mechanically in parallel to the <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> to counteract tremor movement. This phenomenon gives rise to the possibility of an orthotic management of tremor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Upper</b> <b>limbs</b> dysmetria {{caused by}} {{spinal cord injury}} is very rare. We will discuss the {{associated}} mechanism in our articles. Case presentation A 51 -year-old male had sudden onset of weakness, dysmetria over bilateral <b>upper</b> <b>limbs</b> and ataxia after he fell accidentally. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no specific findings. C-spine MRI revealed C 1 myelopathy and C 4 - 6 spinal cord compression by bulged disc. The symptoms subsided after surgical intervention. Conclusion Sudden onset of <b>upper</b> <b>limbs</b> dysmetria {{is a sign of}} dysfunction in cerebellum and its associated pathway. However, lesion in spinal cord can also cause cerebellar signs such as dysmetria. </p...|$|R

25|$|In 1971, surgery of the tetraplegic <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> {{experienced}} a revival after Moberg’s clinical investigations. His main contributions were (1) to restore elbow extension through {{transfer of the}} posterior deltoid to triceps (the initial procedure); and (2) to reconstruct a key pinch. Moberg’s idea of posterior deltoid transfer to restore elbow extension has been used extensively by many surgeons, such as Bryan and DeBenedetti.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{reconstruction}} of the <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> can only be performed if active elbow extension is present. This stabilizes the elbow and gives the patient a reach. It will also allow {{the transfer of the}} other muscles crossing the elbow joint (like the m. brachioradialis and m. extensor carpi radialis longus). It is also an operation whose results allow the patient to gain confidence {{in the rest of the}} treatment.|$|E
25|$|The {{software}} tools typically calculate biomechanical properties including individual muscle forces, joint forces and moments. Most of these tools employ standard ergonomic evaluation {{methods such as}} the NIOSH lifting equation and Rapid <b>Upper</b> <b>Limb</b> Assessment (RULA). Some simulations also analyze physiological measures including metabolism, energy expenditure, and fatigue limits Cycle time studies, design and process validation, user comfort, reachability, and line of sight are other human-factors that may be examined in ergonomic simulation packages.|$|E

The <b>upper</b> <b>limbs</b> will also be needed to manage walkers, crutches and wheelchairs in different ways.

25|$|A {{group of}} hand {{surgeons}} {{realized in the}} 1970s {{that the level of}} injury did not predict the number of available muscles in the <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> very well. Therefore, the international classification was established in 1979, at the Edinburgh meeting. It was called “The international classification (IC) of hand surgery in tetraplegic patients” (table 2) and it describes the number of possible transferable muscles. To measure and evaluate hand strength each muscle is tested and all muscles with a BMRC grade of M4 or more are recorded.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalence}} of phantom pain in <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> amputees is nearly 82%, and in lower limb amputees is 54%. One {{study found that}} eight days after amputation, 72% of patients had phantom limb pain, and six months later, 67% reported it. Some amputees experience continuous pain that varies in intensity or quality; others experience several bouts of pain per day, or it may reoccur less often. It {{is often described as}} shooting, crushing, burning or cramping. If the pain is continuous for a long period, parts of the intact body may become sensitized, so that touching them evokes pain in the phantom limb. Phantom limb pain may accompany urination or defecation.|$|E
25|$|Spasticity, if present, {{can be very}} important. It is not a {{contraindication}} per se, but severe spasticity must {{be treated}} first depending in which muscle groups it is present. Spascticity can be treated with botox or myotomies. In some cases spastic tone can be useful to facilitate hand grasp and grip. Harmful spasticity that does not respond to medication or surgical treatment is a contraindication. The shoulder muscles, pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi, must be evaluated. The shoulder must not only have good motor condition but also good proprioceptive control. The trophicity and articular condition of the <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> must also be considered. A poor condition requires a preoperative rehabilitation program.|$|E
40|$|Background: Many {{diseases}} of the <b>upper</b> <b>limbs</b> have a high correlation between micro traumas awkward postures of <b>upper</b> <b>limbs</b> and activities performed with continuous and repetitive rhythms. Objectives: Aim {{of the study is}} to assess the presence of <b>upper</b> <b>limb’s</b> symptoms correlated with repetitive movements and muscle strain. Methods: A clinical-anamnestic questionnaire was administered to a group of workers. The differences between the averages were evaluated through the Student T test. The frequency of the single variables was compared using Yates’ Peason Chi Square test, using the Solo BMDP Statistical Software Program. Results: Automotive industry workers showed a higher incidence of diseases than white collar. Significant difference was also evident between the parameters recorded before the work shift and the ones recorded {{at the end of the}} work shift only among the workers. Conclusions: The presence of specific symptoms seems to suggest that the <b>upper</b> <b>limb’s</b> diseases and the activities characterized by repetitiveness, incongruent postures and strength are correlated...|$|R

25|$|For many {{children}} with CP, parents are {{heavily involved in}} self-care activities. Self-care activities, such as bathing, dressing, grooming, can be difficult for children with CP as self-care depends primarily on use of the upper limbs. For those living with CP, impaired <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> function affects almost 50% of children and is considered the main factor contributing to decreased activity and participation. As the hands are used for many self-care tasks, sensory and motor impairments of the hands make daily self-care more difficult. Motor impairments cause more problems than sensory impairments. The most common impairment is that of finger dexterity, which {{is the ability to}} manipulate small objects with the fingers. Compared to other disabilities, people with cerebral palsy generally need more help in performing daily tasks.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) is used {{to measure}} a tetraplegic patient's performance and satisfaction before and after <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> surgery. This is done by identifying important goals of hand surgery and evaluating patient-perceived performance and satisfaction of hand surgery for these goals. Goals are identiﬁed through an interview between the therapist and the patient based on past experience. Published reports are provided about the expected outcomes of elbow extension transfers on strength and function of patients with a spinal cord injury. For each goal, the subject rated performance and satisfaction using a 10-point Likert scale, in which 1 was negative (“cannot perform,” “not satisfied”) and 10 was positive (“performs very well,” “very satisfied”). After surgery, performance and satisfaction are rated again for each goal.|$|E
