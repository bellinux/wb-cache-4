2500|$|Straight chiropractors {{adhere to}} the {{philosophical}} principles set forth by D.D. and B.J. Palmer, and retain metaphysical definitions and vitalistic qualities. Straight chiropractors believe that vertebral subluxation leads to interference with an [...] "innate intelligence" [...] exerted via the human nervous system and is a primary <b>underlying</b> <b>risk</b> factor for many diseases. Straights view the medical diagnosis of patient complaints (which {{they consider to be}} the [...] "secondary effects" [...] of subluxations) to be unnecessary for chiropractic treatment. Thus, straight chiropractors are concerned primarily with the detection and correction of vertebral subluxation via adjustment and do not [...] "mix" [...] other types of therapies into their practice style. Their philosophy and explanations are metaphysical in nature and they prefer to use traditional chiropractic lexicon terminology (e.g., perform spinal analysis, detect subluxation, correct with adjustment). They prefer to remain separate and distinct from mainstream health care. Although considered the minority group, [...] "they have been able to transform their status as purists and heirs of the lineage into influence dramatically out of proportion to their numbers." ...|$|E

The supplier can, due to production lead times, realize only a single production run.|$|R
40|$|The {{shortcomings}} of the EPA lead standard were largely determined by {{the requirements of the}} Clean Air Act.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the effect of operational, market and {{accounting}} risks disclosures on investors' disagreements about French firms' value. The paper provides evidence on risks reporting efficiency in reducing investors' disagreements about the implication for firm's value of changes in <b>underlying</b> <b>risks</b> factors. Investors' disagreement is measured by trading volume. We work on the whole sample of French-listed firms and focus on those disclosing about their risks exposure. Using balanced panel data, we apply regression analyses for each risk factor changes on trading volume during 120 days before and after annual report release. The results show that only market risk reporting reduces disagreements about changes in underlying market rates or prices. This result is consistent with the theoretical efficiency of risks disclosures in improving value reporting. However, our findings indicate insignificant and weak effect of operational and accounting risks disclosures on investors' disagreements about changes in <b>underlying</b> <b>risks</b> factors. This evidence mitigates concerns about the usefulness of COB's (2002) operational and accounting risks disclosures requirements. Additional analysis reveals that risk disclosures reported in quantitative terms are more efficient than those reported in qualitative term...|$|R

In this paper, the idea is extended to a dynamic setting. Specifically, convex bounds on multiplicative processes are derived. Despite their relative simplicity, the extremal processes are shown to produce reasonably accurate bounds on option prices in the classical trinomial model for incomplete markets.

50|$|On 11 May 2005 a {{severely}} critical independent report into the Police Communications Centres was released. It expressed ongoing concerns for public safety, and identified inadequate management, poor leadership, inadequate training, understaffing, underutilised technology {{and a lack}} of customer focus as being <b>underlying</b> <b>risks</b> for systemic failures. The report made over 60 recommendations for improvement, including recommending a 15 to 20 year strategy to move away from using 111 as an emergency telephone number because of problems with misdialling due to the repeated digits.|$|R

50|$|AQR {{is perhaps}} best known for its {{alternative}} investment strategies, which aim to offer low correlation to traditional, equity-dominated portfolios. AQR {{was one of the first}} investment managers to offer a risk parity strategy, which aims to balance allocations based on <b>underlying</b> <b>risk</b> rather than asset classes. The firm also offers managed futures, a trend-following strategy that is “uncorrelated with other asset classes” and supported by over a century of academic evidence.|$|E
50|$|Deviant and sadistic {{sexual fantasies}} are {{believed}} to be the <b>underlying</b> <b>risk</b> factors for sexual crimes. 70-85% of sexual offenders extensively engage in deviant sexual fantasies, and certain themes can be attributed to types of sex crimes. For example, serial sexual murderers have more rape fantasies than non-serial sexual murderers and 82% of offenders that use a weapon engage violent sexual fantasies. Offenders that report deviant sexual fantasies have also been found to be more dangerous than offenders that do not.|$|E

30|$|These {{risks are}} likely to be further {{enhanced}} if the domain of investment is high-tech focus. Although, the FVCs possess high opportunity recognition potential with respect to high-tech domains, they {{are likely to}} possess lower depth of local networks that guard them against information asymmetry risks (Wright et al., 2005). On the contrary although the DVCs are likely to possess better understanding of the socio-cultural-institutional context, traditionally high-tech investing has not been their forte. Naturally, each of these VCs firm categories is likely to use different strategies to negotiate the <b>underlying</b> <b>risks.</b>|$|R
30|$|The other {{important}} attribute pertaining to team composition {{relates to the}} prior experience and ethnicity of the team members. Specifically, erstwhile founding experience of VC professionals {{has been found to}} enrich their perceptions of the <b>underlying</b> <b>risks,</b> enhance their knowledge of market entry and augment their potential for identifying agency problems (Patzelt et al., 2009). Further, such experience is likely to enable them to better assist the venture during the post-investment period and better identify with the investee ventures and be supportive of them (Patzelt et al., 2009).|$|R
50|$|Typically, tissue {{plasminogen}} activator may be administered within three to four-and-a-half hours of stroke onset if the patient is without contraindications (i.e. a bleeding diathesis such as recent major surgery or cancer with brain metastases). High dose aspirin can be given within 48 hours. For long term prevention of recurrence, medical regimens are typically aimed towards correcting the <b>underlying</b> <b>risk</b> factors for lacunar infarcts such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus and cigarette smoking. Anticoagulants such as heparin and warfarin have shown no benefit over aspirin with regards to five year survival.|$|E
50|$|The {{differential}} {{discount rate}} for μ and r implicitly allows the DM Method {{to account for}} the <b>underlying</b> <b>risk.</b> If μ > r, then the option will be risk-averse, typical for both financial and real options. If μ < r, then the option will be risk-seeking. If μ = r, then this is termed a risk-neutral option, and has parallels with NPV-type analyses with decision-making, such as decision trees. The DM Method gives the same results as the Black-Scholes and the binomial lattice option models, provided the same inputs and the discount methods are used. This non-traded real option value therefore is dependent on the risk perception of the evaluator toward a market asset relative to a privately held investment asset.|$|E
50|$|A humerus {{fracture}} is a {{bone fracture}} {{of the bone}} of the upper arm, the humerus. Fractures of the humerus may be classified by {{the location of the}} fracture and divided into fractures of the proximal region, which is near the shoulder, the middle region, which is the shaft of the humerus, and the distal region, which is near the elbow. These locations can further be divided based on the extent of the fracture and the specific areas of each of the three regions affected. Humerus fractures usually occur after physical trauma, falls, excess physical stress, or pathological conditions. Falls are {{the most common cause of}} proximal and shaft fractures, and those who experience a fracture from a fall usually have an <b>underlying</b> <b>risk</b> factor for bone fracture. Distal fractures occur most frequently in children who experience physical trauma to the elbow area.|$|E
40|$|In this article, we {{investigate}} the valuation of insurance derivatives which facilitate the trading of insurance risks on capital markets, such as catastrophe derivatives that were traded at the Chicago Board of Trade.

We derive a representation of those catastrophe derivative price processes that are actuarially consistent and determine several situations in which actuarial consistency leads to a complete market for catastrophe derivatives.

40|$|When the {{dependence}} structure among several risks is unknown, {{it is common}} in the actuarial literature to study the worst dependence structure that {{gives rise to the}} riskiest aggregate loss.

The objective {{of this article is to}} present a new proof using the notions of decreasing rearrangement and the majorization theorem, and give clear explanation of the relation between convex order, the theory of majorization and comonotonicity. © 2010 Elsevier B.
