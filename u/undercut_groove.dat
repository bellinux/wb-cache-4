40|$|Particularly in the {{automotive}} industry, {{there is a}} persistent problem arising from the need to reliably and permanently bond dissimilar materials such as plastics and metals. To solve this problem, experts at the Fraunhofer ILT in Aachen {{have come up with}} a solution that is suitable for industrial applications. Unlike adhesive bonding, the process works without additives or additional intervals for hardening or surface cleaning. Starting from the state-of-the-art process used today, the chain can be optimized for butt connections to a novel process using the thermal energy applied by the microstructuring process of the metal component. A new joining device is introduced, which allows the microstructuring of the metal component with an angle of incidence. After heating the component by the microstructuring process, it is pressed into the plastic component in the same joining device. The liquid plastic flows inside the inclined microstructures, which have a big <b>undercut</b> <b>groove</b> and a barb-like effect in the tensile shear load direction. After curing, the connection is based on a mechanical interlocking between the two components. At first suitable microstructuring parameters are evaluated to achieve a homogeneous melt flow of the plastic inside the cavities, which enables a high structure filling-rate and a good mechanical performance of the joint in tensile shear tests. Furthermore, the resulting temperature distribution is evaluated by thermocouples. Different influencing factors on the strength are evaluated like various penetration depths, different structure distances, or different clamping offsets of the plastic component...|$|E

Therefore this work introduces the concept of shape factors for the maximum specific pressure for <b>undercut</b> <b>grooves</b> namely round and <b>undercut</b> <b>grooves</b> and also derives it by means of stress fuction method...|$|R

40|$|Joining of {{dissimilar}} {{materials is}} gaining {{more and more}} importance especially in the automotive industry. The latest international initiatives concerning the average fleet CO 2 -emissions are forcing manufacturers {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and exhaust gas output. This can mainly be achieved by reducing the weight of the vehicles. New methods for weight optimization have been enabled by material selections adapted to local strength requirements. While plastics are characterized by low density, low price, and literally unlimited shaping, metals can withstand distinctly higher mechanical loads. Hybrid components combine the contradictory characteristics of plastics and metal and thus can lead to advantageous construction part properties. As a result, light and concomitantly stiff components can be produced. The need for joining these dissimilar materials without using additional material such as adhesives or primers is a central challenge. A new approach to overcome the p roblems of state-of-the-art technologies is using laser radiation to ablate the metal surface in order to create microstructures with <b>undercut</b> <b>grooves.</b> When the above placed plastic is melted with laser radiation or induction joining, the material expands into these structures through external clamping pressure and after setting the joining results due to microclamping.

40|$| finds from Mozów with undecorated Kędrzyno vessels is a {{characteristic}} way of rim treatment which involves its thickening and distinguishing {{from the wall}} {{by means of an}} encircling undercut. Potsherds with rims of this shape were recovered from features: B 4, B 34, B 92 and B 129. They co-occurred with both decorated and undecorated vessels of Suków-Dziecice type. According to Edward Dąbrowski, who first drew attention to this characteristic trait of vessels occurring within a limited area of northern part of present day Lubuskie Province, the origins of such rim forms should be sought among some vessels of Dobrodzień group (grupa dobrodzieńska) dating to the Late Roman Influence period. The settlement microregion of Sulechów-Mozów is defined as the southern boundary of the area characterised by more frequent occurrence of vessels with the aforementioned rims. Apart from Mozów, analogous forms were discovered at Kalsk, site 1 and Sulechów, site 25. In all the above cases they were represented by undecorated vessels made without the use of a potter’s wheel. The present study has revealed that the vessels with undercut rims do not form a homogenous technological-stylistic-chronological group. The older items, dating from the sixth to the seventh century were made without the use of a potter’s wheel; they were characterised by undercuts executed in a careless manner and simple forms of rims with mostly semi-oval or flattened tops. Younger vessels of this group, which are dated predominantly to the eighth century are already the forms finished on a potter’s wheel, usually thin-walled, with a clearly marked <b>groove</b> (<b>undercut)</b> placed immediately below the rim. The rims are often strongly profiled, well elaborated and some of them give impression of having been made with a template. In the area of Sulechów the forms with undercut rims disappear during the eighth century. Instead, already in the beginning of that century emerge undecorated vessels ended with edges modelled from the inside, which resemble distinctly the younger examples of rims with indentation for a lid. A few forms of this kind were recovered also at Mozów, site 23, e. g. in features: B 26, B 92, B 200, however, they occurred more often in the assemblages dating only from {{the second half of the}} eighth century (e. g. at Gościkowo, site 5), and especially from the ninth century (e. g. at the settlement of Sulechów, site 28, where they are linked with the influences from the area of Lower Silesia). According to Paweł Pawlak vessels of this type, which are known also from Myszęcin, site 19 (dating from the half of the eighth to the ninth century), represent transitional forms between Sukow and Feldberg style, or are the signs of foreign cultural influences in the local pottery production. In the eighth and ninth centuries, when the use of a potter’s wheel in the production of vessels becomes widespread, the characteristic forms of rims include those modelled from the inside with deep encircling grooves (in some cases even triple ones). It seems that such a rim shape was not an unintended consequence of fast rotation of a potter’s wheel, but rather the result of a purposeful fashioning made perhaps with a comb or other toothed tool. This trait is characteristic of numerous vessels from the sites located particularly in the area defining the southern boundary of the prior occurrence of vessels with undercut rims. Such forms were recorded, i. a. at the stronghold of Gostchorze, site 1, at Tarnawa Rzepińska, site 1, in the layer dating to the end of the eighth and the beginning of the ninth century at Krosno Odrzańskie, site 1, among pottery assemblages of the stronghold at Kije, site 1, at Smolno Wielkie, site 1, at the settlement dating to the eighth century at Kalsk, site 4, among pottery finds from the probable stronghold at Górzykowo, site 1, and in the layers from the second phase of the stronghold at Połupin, site 2 dating (according to the recent study) to the first half of the eighth century at the earliest. Rims with similar profiles were found also at the settlement of Letnica, site 13, where occurred also forms decorated with elaborate comb patterns. It should be noted that rims shaped in this way were not recorded in pottery assemblages from the site at Mozów. Establishing the chronology of vessels recovered from the site at Mozów, and, accordingly, the dating of the settlement, is not an easy task. The difficulties arise from the fact that pottery from the older phases of the Early Middle Ages lacks sufficiently sensitive chronological characteristics. Until the end of the eighth century the vessel assemblages found in the Middle Odra region consisted predominantly of undecorated forms, which until approximately half of the eighth century were produced mostly without the use of a potter’s wheel. For this reason it is difficult to determine a precise chronological framework of the vessels older than the ninth century only on the basis of formal-stylistic analysis. In the case of ceramic material from Mozów, given the small percentage of decorated forms and those made with a potter’s wheel (about 2...|$|R
