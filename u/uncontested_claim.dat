At the Treaty of Managua in 1860, Great Britain allowed Nicaragua to have <b>uncontested</b> <b>claim</b> over the Mosquito Coast. The treaty provided for a Miskitu reserve, a self-governing entity that enjoyed semi-sovereign rights. Nicaraguan forces occupied the area in 1894 and took over the state. The British restored the Miskito Reserve in July, but Nicaraguan forces reoccupied in August 1894 and ended its independence.|$|E

Based on fresh evidence uncovered by this team, including a raft of police reports that, against standard practice, had never been passed to the defence team, the case was returned to the Court of Criminal Appeal in June 2003. Despite the fresh evidence and an <b>uncontested</b> <b>claim</b> that the DPP had deliberately concealed evidence from the defence, the Court of Criminal Appeal again dismissed the appeal.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographyThis article {{explores the}} {{previously}} <b>uncontested</b> <b>claim</b> {{that the free}} trade agreements (FTAs) signed by Latin American countries -the cornerstone of their international economic integration strategies since 1990 - have led to export diversification in terms of variety of goods and number of trading partners. Using data from the United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database (COMTRADE), we show {{that the bulk of}} export growth in the region has been in the intensive rather than the extensive margin. Concentration indices support the finding that the expansion of exports into new products and new trading partners has been limited. Latin America's bid to diversify its exports using FTAs (based on a static concept of comparative advantages) instead of more comprehensive strategies has had a negligible impact. Governments should therefore adopt a more dynamic approach to comparative advantages and introduce more active policies. Finally, we pose some open questions for future research...|$|E

40|$|European civil {{procedural}} law {{has been in a}} constant state of flux since the coming into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1999. The introduction of Article 65 EC Treaty was followed by numerous Community instruments in the field of civil procedure, mostly regulations that have direct binding force in the Member States. These have changed the face of litigation in the European Union. This paper focuses on the recent developments in European {{procedural law}}, and more in particular the establishment of the first two harmonized European procedures. The emphasis is on the European Small Claims Procedure, which as a full, adversarial procedure is more substantial than the primarily administrative European Order for Payment Procedure for <b>uncontested</b> <b>claims.</b> First on overview of harmonization of procedural law in Europe after the Treaty of Amsterdam is provided, then the European Small Claims Procedure is analyzed. The final section contains some thoughts on the harmonization of procedural law in Europe. First, the accomplishments and innovative features are discussed. Second, some difficulties and fundamental issues of the harmonization of procedural law in Europe are presented...|$|R

40|$|Diploma thesis "Regulation Brussels I {{and other}} {{procedural}} legislation of European private international law" (with regards to {{recognition and enforcement}} of judgments in civil and commercial matters) {{is focused on the}} procedure of recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments in the European Union. The beginning of the thesis is dedicated to the European legislative development of the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. The key part of the thesis, analysis of recognition and enforcement according to Council Regulation (EC) No 44 / 2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, so called Brussels I Regulation, is contained in the third chapter. This chapter describes the procedure required for recognition and enforcement of judgments given in one member state in another member state, lists related significant decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union and provides critical evaluation of this procedure by specialists. The aim of Chapters four and five is introduction of regulations that came into force after the Brussels I Regulation. These are Regulation (EC) No 805 / 2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 creating a European Enforcement Order for <b>uncontested</b> <b>claims</b> and Regulation (EC) No [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The EU {{judicial}} cooperation in civil matters system was developed following {{the needs of}} member states to achieve a common goal, which {{is to create a}} space of mutual recognition of judgements and distribute the juridical effects of the order created under one jurisdiction thru out the entire European space. One of the main pillars of this system is the creation of European Enforcement Orders, judgements or other titles enforceable in a member state without prior recognition of declaration of enforceability. This system has been developed other the years, starting with the European Enforcement Order for <b>uncontested</b> <b>claims,</b> continuing with the European Order for Payment procedure and European Small Claims procedure, and reaching its peak in Regulation (EU) 1215 / 2012. By virtue of this Regulation, entered into force in January 2015, a judgment given in a Member State which is enforceable in that Member State shall be enforceable in the other Member States without any declaration of enforceability being required (art. 39). The article analyses the evolution of EU regulation regarding the enforceability of foreign judgements and the system created under Regulation (EU) 1215 / 2012, given its importance for the {{judicial cooperation}} in civil matters {{and its impact on the}} legislation of member stated. Also, a brief analysis of the provisions of the new Romanian civil procedure Code is made, given its amendments by Law no. 138 / 2014...|$|R
40|$|Resumé EUROPEAN ENFORCEMENT ODER AND EUROPEAN PAYMENT ORDER For {{my master}} thesis I chose the topic, the European {{enforcement}} {{order and the}} European payment order, which is mainly focused on two regulations : the Regulation (EC) No 805 / 2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 creating a European Enforcement Order for <b>uncontested</b> <b>claims</b> (thereafter only as a "REEO") and the Regulation (EC) No 1896 / 2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 creating a European order for payment procedure (thereafter only as a "REPO). The thesis is divided into five parts. The first part is Introduction. The second part named the General Part deals with general topics which have a certain relationship with the questions of the thesis. Firstly, I am writing about the enforcement order and the payment order in general. Then, I am writing about the enforcement order and how it has been regulated in a few European member states. The General part also describes main aspects of private international law and European private international law. The component of the General part is also {{the historical development of}} the European law. Finally, I am mentioning a general concept of the arrangement of the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgements. The third part named European [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} of European Private International Law (EPIL) have considerably enhanced {{the principle of}} mutual recognition {{in the framework of}} judicial cooperation in civil matters. With regard to the free movement of judicial and extrajudicial judgments, the general guidelines provided by the Tampere and Stockholm programmes have been pursued under two different directions. On the one hand, mutual recognition has been achieved by a partial or complete harmonization of procedural law (Regulation No 1896 / 2006 creating a European order for payment procedure; Regulation No 861 / 2007 establishing a European Small Claims Procedure). On the other hand, mutual recognition has entailed a gradual abolition of all intermediate measures or proceedings for the recognition and enforcement of civil judgments issued by Member States (Regulation No 805 / 2004 on the European enforcement order for <b>uncontested</b> <b>claims,</b> and, partially, Regulation No 4 / 2009 on cross-border maintenance obligations). More recently, Regulation No 1215 / 2012 (Brussels I-bis) has provided for the direct enforcement of judgments given in another Member State without a declaration of enforceability (abolition of exequatur). Nevertheless, under some of these instruments there remain limits to mutual recognition. For instance, under Brussels I-bis, the person against whom enforcement is sought may apply for refusal of the recognition or enforcement of a judgment if he considers that one of the grounds for refusal of recognition (e. g. public policy) is present. It is also possible to invoke the grounds for refusal available under the national law of the Member State of enforcement. The main purpose of the paper is to provide a coherent and comprehensive framework of the expansion of the principle of mutual recognition in EPIL instruments. It will then review the challenges posed by the (potential) extension of the principle on other sensitive areas of law, such as family matters and civil status documents...|$|R
40|$|Scholars and jurists {{have long}} sought an {{explanation}} for why the Framers of Article III distinguished “Cases” from “Controversies. ” In a previous article that cataloged the exercise of federal jurisdiction over uncontested matters, such as pension claims, warrant applications, and naturalization proceedings, we tried to provide an answer to this question. We suggested that, at least as to “cases” arising under federal law, the federal courts could exercise what Roman and civil lawyers called non-contentious jurisdiction or, {{in the words of}} Chief Justice Marshall, could hear <b>uncontested</b> <b>claims</b> of right in the form prescribed by law. As for “controversies,” by contrast, the federal courts were limited to the adjudication of disputes between parties aligned as Article III specifies. Much that seems strange about the practice of federal jurisdiction becomes clear when viewed in light of our proposed interpretation. Thus, our Article accounts not only for the difference in Article III’s text, but also for the refusal of the federal courts to hear uncontested matters of state law, such as some probate and domestic relations proceedings. Our account also calls into question the claim that Article III embeds inflexible “injury” and “adverse-party” requirements in the definition of judicial power. It was those claims that triggered the response from Professor Ann Woolhandler, to which this Article briefly replies. Woolhandler argues that Article III requires not adverse parties, so much, as adverse interests. In the course of doing so, she embraces a late nineteenth-century revisionism that twisted the meaning of Article III. In the end, however, she fails to offer a coherent theory of the text of Article III or to explain why her newfangled adverse-interest construct better explains the history of judicial practice than the eighteenth-century construct of non-contentious jurisdiction with which the Framers were familiar...|$|R

In theory the side judges, who are generally not attorneys, have input only on matters of fact, with matters of law left to the presiding judge, but the vote of a side judge has the same weight {{as that of the}} judge, so two side judges can outvote the judge. If there is only one side judge and the side judge and the judge disagree on a matter of fact, a mistrial is declared.

40|$|In 2010, the ‘Brand Africa’ {{initiative}} was launched {{with the mission}} to transform perceptions of Africa from a continent of calamities into one of promising economic prospects and entrepreneurial populations. This transformation, ‘Brand Africa’ claims, is one where Africans take their representation {{from the hands of}} foreigners and make, through a new image, their own (hi) story. In this respect Brand Africa can be interpreted as a form of subaltern geopolitics seeking to subvert dominant geopolitical knowledge and to fight established structures of domination. However, the article argues its subversive elements are limited, especially when compared to the historical discourses of decolonial pan-Africanism upon which it draws for legitimacy. Indeed, while appropriating this legacy Brand Africa offers up a very different geopolitical vision of possible/desirable African futures. It is argued that this may be accounted for by understanding {{the extent to which the}} Brand Africa initiative appears embedded within a South African national context and its own geopolitical ambitions evident within its own nation-branding project. What this highlights in turn is that the emancipatory potential and assumed synergies between national and supranational branding central to the Brand Africa initiative are not as unproblematic or <b>uncontested</b> as <b>claimed...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} the thesis is Regulation (EC) No 1896 / 2006 of the EP and of the Council of 12 December 2006 {{creating}} a European order for payment procedure. Regulation established an additional and optional means for the claimant, with the purpose to simplify, speed up and reduce the costs of litigation in cross-border cases concerning <b>uncontested</b> pecuniary <b>claims</b> and to permit the free circulation of European orders for payment throughout the Member States without any intermediate proceedings prior to recognition and enforcement. The aim of the thesis is to analyze the current shape of legislation, its interpretation by the ECJ and existing practical experiences with {{the application of the}} tool in the Czech Republic. Chapter one is devoted to the development in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters, called as well as European civil procedure, and to the summary of the existing regulations. Chapter two deals with the thorough analysis of the laid down proceedings and its consecutive phases. It also contains the evaluation of these regulatory efforts. Chapter three focuses on the analysis of a reference for a preliminary ruling in the Case C- 215 / 11 Szyrocka which is not yet decided. The reference depicts problematic points of coordination between the Regulation and civil procedures of Member States. Last chapter pursues the application of the European order for payment in the Czech judicial system. It summarizes the statistical data about usage of the procedure in the Czech Republic. Moreover, it presents the findings of the qualitative research carried out at thirty district and regional courts...|$|R
