5|$|Today, mirror {{symmetry}} is a {{major research}} topic in pure mathematics, and mathematicians are working to develop a mathematical {{understanding of the relationship}} based on physicists' intuition. Mirror symmetry is also a fundamental tool for doing calculations in string theory, and it has been used to understand aspects of quantum field theory, the formalism that physicists <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> elementary particles. Major approaches to mirror symmetry include the homological mirror symmetry program of Maxim Kontsevich and the SYZ conjecture of Andrew Strominger, Shing-Tung Yau, and Eric Zaslow.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{of string}} theory, mirror {{symmetry}} {{is used to}} understand aspects of quantum field theory, the formalism that physicists <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> elementary particles. For example, gauge theories are a class of highly symmetric physical theories appearing in the standard model of particle physics {{and other parts of}} theoretical physics. Some gauge theories which {{are not part of the}} standard model, but which are nevertheless important for theoretical reasons, arise from strings propagating on a nearly singular background. For such theories, mirror symmetry is a useful computational tool. Indeed, mirror symmetry can be used to perform calculations in an important gauge theory in four spacetime dimensions that was studied by Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten and is also familiar in mathematics in the context of Donaldson invariants. There is also a generalization of mirror symmetry called 3D mirror symmetry which relates pairs of quantum field theories in three spacetime dimensions.|$|E

5000|$|The term {{symbiosis}} (living together) can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> {{various degrees}} of close relationship between organisms of different species. Sometimes it is used only for cases where both organisms benefit; sometimes it is <b>used</b> more generally <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> all varieties of relatively tight relationships, i.e. even parasitism, but not predation. Some even {{go so far as}} <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> predation. [...] It can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> relationships where one organism lives on or in another, or it can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> cases where organisms are related by mutual stereotypic behaviors.|$|R

25|$|The term British {{empiricism}} {{came into}} <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> philosophical differences perceived {{between two of}} its founders Francis Bacon, described as empiricist, and René Descartes, who {{was described as a}} rationalist. Thomas Hobbes, George Berkeley, and David Hume were the philosophy's primary exponents, who developed a sophisticated empirical tradition as the basis of human knowledge.|$|E
25|$|By 5 May 1961, {{the term}} Forces Armées Neutralistes came into <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> Kong Le's military. Kong Le {{recruited}} enough new soldiers to split BP 2 into six companies. Although designated as airborne units, only the veteran cadre had parachute training. By October 1961, FAN was {{in conflict with}} the Royalist guerrillas surrounding the Plain; the effect was to push FAN into cooperation with the communists. After a 23 December 1961 battle between FAN and the guerrillas, a FAN defector and a Vietnamese prisoner verified Vietnamese communist backing for FAN.|$|E
25|$|Home sign arises due to {{the absence}} of any other way to communicate. Within the span of a single {{lifetime}} and without the support or feedback of a community, the child naturally invents signs to help meet his or her communication needs, and may even develop a few grammatical rules for combining short sequences of signs. Still, this kind of system is inadequate for the intellectual development of a child and it comes nowhere near meeting the standards linguists <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> a complete language. No type of home sign is recognized as a full language.|$|E

500|$|In British {{politics}} {{during this}} period, the term [...] "Bennism" [...] came into <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> the conviction politics, economic, {{social and political}} ideology of Tony Benn; and an exponent or advocate of Bennism {{was regarded as a}} [...] "Bennite".|$|E
500|$|The name {{first came}} into <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> the {{north-western}} section of the Perth Road District in 1906. Hamersley Ward was a large area of land covering what is now Hamersley, Carine, Watermans Bay, North Beach, Gwelup and parts of Balcatta, Karrinyup and Trigg. The Hamersley townsite, consisting of Hamersley Ward, was gazetted in 1945. As a result, many facilities in North Beach, including a primary school, a golf course, several sporting clubs and residents' and seniors' associations, were called Hamersley. After the Hamersley Development Scheme started in 1968, confusion as to exactly what Hamersley referred to led to conflict between established organisations in North Beach and emerging ones in Hamersley – the Hamersley Gazette noted in 1973 that [...] "North Beach people have the prior claim but ours is more officially accepted".|$|E
500|$|The name [...] "Foo Fighters" [...] {{was taken}} from the {{description}} World War II aircraft pilots would <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> various UFOs. This science fiction theme is further continued with the name of Grohl's Capitol Records imprint, Roswell Records, a reference to the city of Roswell, New Mexico, known for the Roswell UFO incident of 1947; and the album cover done by Grohl's then-wife, photographer Jennifer Youngblood, featuring a Buck Rogers XZ-38 Disintegrator Pistol. Some reviewers considered the gun on the cover as insensitive, given Kurt Cobain died by shooting himself, but Grohl dutifully disregarded it as just a coincidence. [...] Goldsmith later explained, [...] "It was all pretty much based on the whole Foo Fighters thing—Roswell, the space stuff, an antique Buck Rogers raygun. It's really a completely separate thing. Dave wasn't even conscious of that." [...] Despite Grohl being the album's only contributor, at Capitol's insistence the liner notes included a picture of the full band that Grohl had recruited.|$|E

500|$|In the Browns' early years, Paul Brown {{wanted to}} keep on reserve a number of {{promising}} players who {{did not make the}} team's official roster. McBride made this happen by putting the reserves on his payroll as taxi drivers, although none of them were asked to drive cabs. This group {{came to be known as}} the [...] "taxi squad", a term still in <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> players kept on hand to fill in for injured team members. The taxi squad was just one of the ways in which McBride backed Brown. He viewed owning the team as primarily a civic duty – as a gift to the city. [...] "Cleveland has been good to me," [...] he said in a 1947 interview. [...] "I've made a great deal of money here. If I was looking for a get-rich-quick investment, the last thing I'd do is buy a pro football club. It's a risky business. Too much depends on ideal weather conditions, and this is no climate to risk a buck on a raindrop." ...|$|E
500|$|The campus' {{office of}} public affairs recognizes two {{official}} names for the university: [...] "California State Polytechnic University, Pomona" [...] and [...] "Cal Poly Pomona". However, [...] "Cal Poly" [...] has also been {{used to refer to}} Cal Poly at Pomona, as both itself and California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo, California were one institution spanning two locations from 1938 to 1966. Cal Poly's {{office of public}} affairs recommends not to abbreviate the university's name merely as [...] "Cal Poly". In the years when the University of California was in charge of Kellogg's donated estate in Pomona (1932–1943), the names [...] "University of California, W.K. Kellogg Institute" [...] and [...] "W.K. Kellogg Institute of Animal Husbandry University of California, Pomona", came into <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> the site. Although Cal Poly Pomona is now part of the California State University, its naming convention does not follow that of most campuses within the system (for example, the CSU campus in San Diego bears the full official name [...] "San Diego State University" [...] and the CSU campus in Fullerton uses the name [...] "California State University, Fullerton"). Thus, [...] "Pomona State University" [...] and [...] "California State University, Pomona" [...] are seldom used and not in the university's graphic standard's manual.|$|E
500|$|Nintendo first {{revealed}} WarioWare: Smooth Moves for the Wii at the 2006 E3 convention. The {{game was}} co-developed by Intelligent Systems and the Software Planning Development department of Nintendo. Development {{on the game}} began in late 2005 {{with a team of}} 20 people, directed by Goro Abe and produced by Yoshio Sakamoto. Abe first {{came up with the idea}} for the game when the Wii Remote was revealed to him. Since the developers believed that holding the controller in only one way limited the game's entertainment value, they decided to introduce new positions and motions to the game for the Remote to be held. The software used to register the Remote's movements was written from scratch because of the unique movements required for the game. Similar to previous games in the WarioWare series, the game's subtitle, [...] "Smooth Moves", was used to represent the basic movement that players perform in the game. The developers wanted players to move as if they were dancing when playing the game, so they decided that Smooth Moves was the best phrase to <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> the game's actions. Because of its party genre, the developers made the game's multiplayer mode its [...] "best point".|$|E

5000|$|The Latin word [...] "phallus" [...] (from Greek φαλλος) is {{sometimes}} <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> the penis, although [...] "phallus" [...] originally was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> representations, pictorial or carved, of the penis.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "toughened glass" [...] is {{generally}} <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> fully tempered glass but is sometimes <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> heat-strengthened glass as both types undergo a thermal [...] "toughening" [...] process.|$|R
500|$|The {{allusions to}} {{politics}} throughout the narrative {{are supposed to}} represent the darker undertones surrounding {{the foundations of the}} American Dream. In addition, the game itself exhibits qualities relating to the movement from a [...] "violent freedom" [...] to a situation of [...] "overt state control", told through a story of innocence and freedom. Vice President for Creativity Dan Houser made parallels with this representation, and the more recent predicament of the modern society of America. Houser also expressed the difficulty in balancing the game's narrative to avoid feeling both [...] "camp" [...] and [...] "pompous"; he explained that balancing the two while maintaining realism was where the difficulty spawned. With the story, Houser felt that it does not fully represent the racial attitudes commonly associated with the game's era. He stated that this was a choice made by the designers due to the unpleasantness of the attitudes. [...] "he language people <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> other races is insanely offensive to modern ears and we hint at that but we maybe don't do it with quite the vibrancy that people use in some of our research," [...] he explained. The team focused more on the combination of old and modern America, and the change that was experienced during this period. In terms of the violence depicted throughout the game, Houser spoke about the team's need for it to feel [...] "slightly raw and unpleasant"; they tried to achieve realism without exaggerating. The team were hoping for players to display an [...] "emotional response" [...] from the game, and for them to feel immersed in the game world and time period.|$|E

In North America the term plaid is commonly <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> tartan. The word plaid, derived from the Scottish Gaelic , meaning [...] "blanket", was first used of any rectangular garment, sometimes made up of tartan, particularly that which preceded the modern kilt (see: belted plaid). In time, plaid was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> blankets themselves.|$|R
50|$|The word {{indigenization}} {{first appeared}} in a paper about studies conducted in India about Christian missionaries. The word was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> {{the process of making}} Churches indigenous in southern India. From there, it spread to The Economist where it was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> managerial positions and to a book by John Spencer, named English Language in West Africa, where it was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> the adoption of English. Indigenization is often <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> the adoption of colonial culture in Africa because of the effects of colonialism by Europe in the 19th and early 20th century.|$|R
