Areas of special interest are: A) Balancing the supply and demand of hot water, B) Control strategy of the producers of hot water and C) Possibilities of replacing <b>utility</b> <b>steam</b> with secondary heat. Hot water producers within the Cooking plant, Evaporation plant, Bleaching plant and the Recovery boiler in the mill are examined {{to determine if the}} production of water from each producer is variable or not. The marginal cost for producing water is determined for the variable producers using efficiency data and <b>utility</b> <b>steam</b> cost. Data spanning over the past year for the individual water production to and the fill level in the four different buffer tanks of the secondary heating systems are then analysed to identify imbalances in supply and demand of water. In particular variable producers supplying hot water even when the corresponding buffer tank is full, something which may lead to increased costs, is examined. Furthermore to find the cost minimal solution to balance supply and demand a priority order of producers and some consumers of hot water is established. Any discrepancies compared to the current priority lists are determined to find potential savings. Finally some processes with a heat demand at a relatively low temperature level, which is currently satisfied using <b>utility</b> <b>steam,</b> is studied briefly. If instead supplying the heat demands with excess heat from the secondary heating system, the potential cost reductions are calculated. The conclusions are that approximately 0. 3 million SEK per year can be saved by better balancing supply and demand alone, in this case by implementing an automatic control on one hot water producer. On the other hand there is a potential to reduce the costs by up to 1. 3 million SEK annually if the cost-minimal control strategy identified in this study is used. On top of this, two processes are found in which <b>utility</b> <b>steam</b> use possibly can be replaced with excess secondary heat. If so the yearly potential savings are 3. 2 and 0. 5 million SEK respectively for the processes...|$|E

40|$|Biopharmaceutical {{industries}} consistently applied Water for Injection (WFI) as {{a solvent}} during their production stage. Generally, water is considered as non-hazardous material, {{but in the}} pharmaceutical industries the involved treatments to produce WET typically consumes {{a large amount of}} energy. This energy usually comes from the use of <b>utility</b> <b>steam</b> as well as electricity to heat the water as part of the purification process. Consequently, generation of <b>utility</b> <b>steam</b> and electricity needed to produce WFI releases gas pollutants and directly affecting the environment. However, such potential environmental impact (PEI), which is associated to the demand of WFI in a biopharmaceutical process, is typically not included in the environmental assessment of the process as water is considered benign. Therefore, this work aims to estimate the PET value from WFT and pure steam generation using a simple algorithm which is modified from Waste Reduction (WAR) Algorithm. The PEI is estimated based on the gas pollutants emitted from the energy generation process, which is in this case, the electricity and <b>utility</b> <b>steam.</b> In order to determine the energy needed in WET and pure steam generation, their generation system was modelled and simulated in SuperPro Designer®. WFI is typically produced in Multiple Effect Distillation (MED) system or Vapour Compression Distillation (VCD) system and meanwhile pure steam is produced in pure steam generator (PSG). A hypothetical large-scale of monoclonal antibody (MAb) production is used as a case study to demonstrate the environmental impact assessment using WAR Algorithm inclusive of PET from WFI and pure steam demand during manufacturing process. From the case study, it can be concluded that the WET generation, regardless of using MED or VCD, occupied the largest percentage of energy consumption. The PET shows a major contribution to the total PET value, particularly in global warming potential. The hotspot based on the highest WET consumption is Protein A chromatography. This equipment is used in the downstream processing step to purify the target product. As biopharmaceutical process needs a large amount of WET in the process, therefore it is important to include PET from WFI as part of the environmental assessment. This result is essentially useful as a tool for decision-making {{in order to create a}} more sustainable process...|$|E
