5|$|Six {{months after}} Sam sold {{the bar to}} a corporation, the place caters to a more <b>up-market</b> clientele. Eddie Lebec turns up and is {{surprised}} when Carla Tortelli tells him she is pregnant (incorporated by actress Rhea Perlman's real-life pregnancy). Sam Malone then returns to the bar after his attempt to sail around the world failed at the first hurdle when his sailboat ran ashore in the Caribbean. Though Cheers has new management, Woody Boyd and Carla are still employed at the bar, but they're now required to wear uniforms, much to their chagrin. Sam then also needs a job, but the bar already has two bartenders, Woody and a new employee, Wayne. Diane Chambers' attempts at writing her novel {{are said to have}} failed, which led to her leaving Boston to write in Hollywood.|$|E

40|$|Performance {{of active}} fund {{managers}} {{continues to be}} examined in finance literature. Current convictions are that different investment styles perform {{at different stages of}} the market cycle. Specifically, active manager 2 ̆ 7 s claim that performance is better in bear markets rather than in bull markets. Therefore, this paper examines whether active managers risk adjusted performance is superior in down-markets rather than in <b>up-markets.</b> The performance of 58 mutual funds is examined, as well as the performance of the Fama and French 25 portfolios sorted by size and book-to-market equity. Performance is measured by Jensen 2 ̆ 7 s (1 968) alpha and Fama and French (1 993) and Carhart (1 997) asset-pricing models. The results show little evidence of manager 2 ̆ 7 s outperformance. The results also show no evidence to performance being superior in down-markets rather than in <b>up-markets.</b> Rather, the number of positive alphas is greater in bull markets; however differences between the two market stages are not statistically significant. ii...|$|R
40|$|This {{analysis}} {{explores the}} cross-sectional relationship between stock returns and some firm-specific characteristics in the Chinese A-share {{market for the}} period 1994 to 2002. First, our results indicate that beta lacks explanatory power even when its effect is examined alone in the regression analysis. We also find that size has the most significant effect in capturing variations in stock returns over the whole period. Moreover, while previous studies {{have concluded that the}} A-share market is driven by market rumour and individual investors&# 039; sentiment, this analysis suggests that the book-to-market ratio is also significantly priced. Finally, the use of beta as a measure of systematic risk in China remains unsupported when the beta effect is re-examined in <b>up-markets</b> and down-markets respectively...|$|R

25|$|Unlike other 4x4s {{such as the}} Jeep Wagoneer, the {{original}} Range Rover was not designed as a luxury-type vehicle. While certainly <b>up-market</b> compared to preceding Land Rover models, the early Range Rovers had fairly basic, utilitarian interiors with vinyl seats and plastic dashboards that were designed to be washed down with a hose. Convenience features such as power steering, carpeted floors, air conditioning, cloth/leather seats, and wooden interior trim were fitted later.|$|E

None of this constitutes a loss on the scale of Frescati.|$|E
40|$|Active {{investment}} managers provide {{two types}} of return: the return generated from market exposure or “beta ” and the return that comes from selection skill or “alpha. ” Active “beta ” returns typically come from market timing. That is, increasing market exposure in <b>up-markets</b> and decreasing it in down-markets. Passive beta returns come from index fund exposure. “Alpha ” comes from security selection within an asset class. As such, the value-added from a true alpha strategy does not depend upon {{the direction of the}} market. A true stock-picker, for instance, would have a beta of 1. 0 relative to their market benchmark, and all value-added would come from their “active risk ” or stock picking. Portable alpha refers to the process of separating the alpha from the beta and then applying it to other portfolios. Our focus here is to show how investors can obtain portable alphas via traditional long-only strategies and explore the effects of implementing portable alphas in a variety of investment scenarios and provide a discussion of the benefits and drawbacks. ...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{examines}} the relative strength of two imperfect accounting rules: historical cost and mark to market. The manifest inaccuracy of historical cost {{is well known}} and, paradoxically, one source of its hidden strength. Because private parties know of its evident weaknesses, they look elsewhere for information. In contrast, mark to market for hard-to-value assets has many hidden weaknesses. In this Article we show how it creates asset bubbles and exacerbates their negative collateral consequences once they burst. It does the former by allowing banks to adopt generous valuations in <b>up-markets</b> that increase their lending capacity. It does the latter by forcing the hand of counterparties to demand collateral, even when watchful waiting and inaction is the more efficient course of action when downward cascades generated by mark-to-market accounting might trigger massive sell-offs at prices below true asset value. The fears of private suits and regulatory sanctions on counterparties can compound the problem. Mark to market generates the functional equivalent of bank runs for which the functional equivalent of the automatic-stay rule in bankruptcy is the appropriate response...|$|R

25|$|In 2001, Target {{announced}} its first ever loss, to {{the sum of}} $43m. New senior management was soon put in place, with Target repositioning itself from a store directly competing with Coles Myer stablemate Kmart and Woolworths Limited's Big W, to a more stylish, <b>up-market,</b> but still value-for-money, alternative to speciality stores. Store fittings and layouts were altered to reflect this change. In 2006 Target appointed Launa Inman as managing director, named Telstra Business Women of the Year in 2003, {{a result of her}} achievements as an apparel retail buyer for the company. Her position saw Target's $32 million loss at the end of 2000 turn into a $68 million profit 18 months later.|$|E
25|$|The Land Rover was {{designed}} to only be in production {{for two or three}} years to gain some cash flow and export orders for the Rover Company so it could restart <b>up-market</b> car production. Once car production restarted, however, it was greatly outsold by the off-road Land Rover, which developed into its own brand that remains successful today. Many of the defining and successful features of the Land Rover design were in fact the result of Rover's drive to simplify the tooling required for the vehicle and to use the minimum amount of rationed materials. As well as the aluminium alloy bodywork (which has been retained throughout production despite it now being more expensive than a conventional steel body due to its ideal properties of light weight and corrosion resistance) other examples include the distinctive flat body panels with only simple, constant-radius curves (originally used because they could be cut and formed by hand from aluminium sheet on a basic jig) and the sturdy box-section ladder chassis, which on Series vehicles was made up from four strips of steel welded at each side to form a box, thus cutting down on the complex welding operations required when making a more conventional U- or I-section frame.|$|E

In contrast to her encyclopaedic knowledge of the social distinctions of London's street names, Jack's obscure parentage is subtly evoked. He defends himself against her [...] "A handbag?" [...] with the clarification, [...] "The Brighton Line". At the time, Victoria Station consisted of two separate but adjacent terminal stations sharing the same name. To the east was the ramshackle LC Railway, on the west the <b>up-market</b> LB—the Brighton Line, which went to Worthing, the fashionable, expensive town the gentleman who found baby Jack was travelling to at the time (and after which Jack was named).|$|E
500|$|There {{were two}} cinemas in Sophiatown. The larger was the Odin {{which at the}} time was also the largest in Africa and could seat 1 200 people. The other cinema, Balansky's, was the lower class, rougher movie-house while the Odin Cinema was more <b>up-market.</b> The Odin was the pride of Sophiatown. It was owned by a white couple, the Egnoses, who were known as Mr and Mrs Odin. Not only did they provide much loved entertainment, but also made the Odin {{available}} for political meetings, parties and stage performances. Some international acts played to multi-racial audiences at the Odin. It was also the site of a series of [...] "Jazz at the Odin" [...] jam sessions featuring white and black musicians. Also at a meeting at the Odin, the ultimately unsuccessful resistance to the destruction of Sophiatown began to coalesce.|$|E
500|$|Many reasons {{have been}} {{suggested}} {{for the failure of}} Sinclair Vehicles and what Dale calls [...] "the jigsaw of the C5's disappointment". One of the receivers of Sinclair Vehicles, John Sapte, suggested that Sinclair had taken the wrong tack with its marketing of the C5: [...] "It was presented as a serious transport, when perhaps it should have been presented as a luxury product, an <b>up-market</b> plaything." [...] Ellar's director Maurice Levensohn took exactly this tack when he purchased Sinclair Vehicles' remaining stock, saying that his company would market them as [...] "a sophisticated toy": [...] "If you were a little boy, wouldn't you want your parents to get you one this Christmas?" [...] His strategy was notably successful; Ellar sold nearly 7,000 C5s at up to £700 each, far more (and at a higher price) than Sinclair had ever managed.|$|E
500|$|After Fleming's friend, William Stephenson, {{sent him}} a {{magazine}} article about the spa town of Saratoga Springs, Fleming flew to the US in August 1954, where he met his friends Ivar Bryce and Ernest Cuneo; the three travelled to the town in New York State. There, Fleming and Cuneo visited a mud-bath: en route to an <b>up-market</b> establishment they took the wrong directions and ended up at a run-down outlet, which became {{the inspiration for the}} Acme Mud and Sulphur Baths scene in the book. Fleming met the rich socialite, William Woodward, Jr., who drove a Studillac—a Studebaker with a powerful Cadillac engine. According to Henry Chancellor, [...] "the speed and comfort of it impressed Ian, and he shamelessly appropriated this car" [...] for the book. Woodward was killed by his wife shortly afterwards—she claimed she mistook him for a prowler—and when Diamonds Are Forever was published, it was dedicated to Bryce, Cuneo and [...] "the memory of W.

500|$|The couple {{married and}} settled in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1972, with Gibson looking after their first child while they lived off his wife's {{teaching}} salary. During the 1970s, Gibson made {{a substantial part of}} his living from scouring Salvation Army thrift stores for underpriced artifacts he would then <b>up-market</b> to specialist dealers. Realizing that it was easier to sustain high college grades, and thus qualify for generous student financial aid, than to work, he enrolled at the University of British Columbia (UBC), earning [...] "a desultory bachelor's degree in English" [...] in 1977. Through studying English literature, he was exposed to a wider range of fiction than he would have read otherwise; something he credits with giving him ideas inaccessible from within the culture of science fiction, including an awareness of postmodernity. It was at UBC that he attended his first course on science fiction, taught by Susan Wood, {{at the end of which}} he was encouraged to write his first short story, [...] "Fragments of a Hologram Rose".|$|E
500|$|When reviewing, {{film critics}} often {{compared}} the respective adaptations of Persuasion and Sense and Sensibility. Thompson's film received more recognition and accolades from Hollywood, while Michell's production gained the admiration of <b>up-market</b> critics, who {{felt it was}} a more authentic and thoughtful representation of Austen's world. Janet Maslin of The New York Times, for instance, wrote that Sense and Sensibility [...] "can't match the brilliant incisiveness of the more spartan Persuasion, still the most thoughtful new Austen adaptation". The Los Angeles Times characterised Persuasion as [...] "the most authentically British version and the one closest to the spirit of the novels" [...] and Sense and Sensibility as [...] "the audience-friendly Hollywood version of Austen, easygoing and aiming to please". Time magazine named them both the best films of 1995, referring to Persuasion as [...] "reserved" [...] and Sense and Sensibility as [...] "more bustling". Higson, when analysing both productions, felt Persuasion captured a sense of [...] "gritty realism" [...] that would influence such later Austen adaptations as Mansfield Park (1999) and Becoming Jane (2007).|$|E
500|$|Whether any {{of these}} women could confirm their {{addresses}} for publication in Harris's List is something that author Sophie Carter doubts. [...] She views the annual as [...] "primarily a work of erotica", calling it [...] "nothing {{so much as a}} shopping list... textually arrayed for the delectation of the male consumer", continuing [...] "they [...] await his intervention to institute an exchange", epitomising the traditional male role in pornography. [...] Elizabeth Denlinger includes a similar sentiment in her essay, [...] "The Garment and the Man": [...] "This varied display of women to satisfy the 'great itch'... is a fundamental aspect of the sphere to which Harris's List offered British men a carte d'entrée". [...] Rubenhold writes that the variability in the descriptions of prostitutes over the years the list was published defy [...] "all attempts to categorise it as either exclusively <b>up-market</b> or simply middle of the road." [...] She suggests that the annual's purpose was to [...] "conduct the desirous to the embrace of a prostitute", and that its prose was designed for [...] "solitary sexual enjoyment" [...] (H. Ranger also sold back-issues of Harris's List). [...] Sold to a London public which was mostly patriarchal, its listings reflect the prejudices of the men who authored them. [...] They were therefore not representative of women generally, and as she concludes, [...] "it is likely that their stories would have differed quite significantly from those recounted by their customers {{for the benefit of the}} List's publishers." ...|$|E
500|$|Marvel Whiteside Parsons {{was born}} on October 2, 1914, at the Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles. His parents, Ruth Virginia Whiteside (c. 1893–1952) and Marvel H. Parsons (c. 1894–1947), had moved to California from Massachusetts the {{previous}} year, purchasing a house on Scarf Street in downtown Los Angeles. Their son was his father's namesake, but was known in the household as Jack. The marriage broke down soon after Jack's birth, when Ruth discovered {{that his father had}} made numerous visits to a prostitute, and she filed for divorce in March 1915. Parsons' father returned to Massachusetts after being publicly exposed as an adulterer, with Ruth forbidding him from having any contact with Jack. Parsons' father later joined the armed forces, reaching the rank of major, and married a woman with whom he had a son named Charles, a half-brother Jack would only meet once. Although she retained her ex-husband's surname, Ruth started calling her son John; many friends throughout his life knew him as Jack. Ruth's parents Walter and Carrie Whiteside moved to California to be with Jack and their daughter, using their wealth to buy an <b>up-market</b> house on Orange Grove Avenue in Pasadena—known locally as [...] "Millionaire's Mile"—where they could live together. Jack was surrounded by domestic servants. Having few friends, he lived a solitary childhood and spent much time reading; he took a particular interest in works of mythology, Arthurian legend, and the Arabian Nights. Through the works of Jules Verne he became interested in science fiction and a keen reader of pulp magazines like Amazing Stories, which led to his early interest in rocketry.|$|E
