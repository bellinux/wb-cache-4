25|$|On 6 January 1579 {{the provinces}} {{loyal to the}} Spanish Monarchy signed the {{defensive}} Union of Arras, expressed their loyalty to Philip II and recognized Farnese as Governor-General of the Netherlands.

25|$|Under Habsburg Charles V, {{ruler of}} the Holy Roman Empire and King of Spain, all fiefs in the current Netherlands region were united into the Seventeen Provinces, which also {{included}} most of present-day Belgium, Luxembourg, and some adjacent land {{in what is now}} France and Germany. In 1568, the Eighty Years' War between the Provinces and their Spanish ruler began. In 1579, the northern half of the Seventeen Provinces forged the <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> <b>Utrecht</b> in which they committed to support each other in their defence against the Spanish army. The <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> <b>Utrecht</b> is seen as the foundation of the modern Netherlands. In 1581, the northern provinces adopted the Act of Abjuration, the declaration of independence in which the provinces officially deposed Philip II of Spain as reigning monarch in the northern provinces.|$|E
25|$|In 1579 the {{northern}} seven provinces signed the <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> <b>Utrecht,</b> {{in which they}} decided to join forces against Spanish rule.

In 1580 the new and predominantly Protestant state abolished the bishoprics, including the archbishopric of Utrecht. The stadtholders disapproved of the independent course of the Utrecht bourgeoisie and brought the city under much more direct control of the republic; which shifted the power towards its dominant province Holland. This was the start of a long period of stagnation of trade and development in Utrecht. Utrecht remained an atypical city in the new republic with about 40% Catholic in the mid-17th-century, and even more among the elite groups, who included many rural nobility and gentry with town houses there.|$|E

Bartas did not recount the significance of Alvares' ideology, he only noted that the schism, around 1902, intended to convert corporately, to eastern orthodoxy. The cathedral in Colombo, had one priest, Alvares, fairly advanced in age. He and his parishioners asked the Holy Synod of the Church of Greece, in Athens, to accept them under its jurisdiction and to send them an officiating priest preaching in Latin and English. Bartas wrote:But the Greek Holy Synod, reflected on information provided by the Archimandrite Germain Kazakis, head of the Orthodox settlement of Calcutta in addition to the parishioners' application in which they declared themselves Orthodox but still held Roman Catholic liturgies, sacraments, and devotions. According to Smit, [...] "presumably seeing an analogy between the respective emergences of the two churches," [...] Stephen Silva, the [...] secretary, complained to Gregorio Aglipay of the Philippine Independent Church in 1903 that the [...] "cannot get sufficient priests to work independently of Rome."

25|$|Historically Anglican {{churches have}} had strong ecumenical {{ties with the}} Eastern Orthodox Churches, and the Episcopal Church {{particularly}} with the Russian Orthodox Church, but relations in more recent years have been strained by {{the ordination of women}} and the ordination of Gene Robinson to the episcopate.

25|$|The {{army in the}} Netherlands mutinied {{not long}} after, seizing Antwerp and looting the {{southern}} Netherlands, prompting several cities in the previously peaceful southern provinces to join the rebellion.

25|$|The {{northern}} part of Belgica Regia, comprising seven provinces and eventually forming the Dutch Republic, became increasingly Protestant (i.e. Calvinistic), while the larger part, called 't Hof van Brabant and comprising the ten southern provinces, remained primarily Catholic. This schism, and other cultural differences which had been present since ancient times, launched the Union of Atrecht in the Belgian regions, later followed by the <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> <b>Utrecht</b> in the northern regions. When Philip II, son of Charles V, ascended the Spanish throne he tried to abolish all Protestantism. Portions of Belgica Regia revolted, eventually resulting in the Eighty Years' War between Spain and the Dutch Republic.|$|E

25|$|The Great Assembly {{that was}} held between January and August, 1651, {{addressed}} {{a number of important}} issues. The first one was that of the stadholderate. Friesland and Groningen led the opposition to Holland, arguing that the <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> <b>Utrecht</b> required the appointment of provincial stadtholders by implication, as the articles 9 and 21 of the treaty stipulated mediation by stadtholders in case of conflicts between provinces. In their interpretation the office of stadtholder thereby acquired a federal aspect. But the other provinces were not convinced. They decided to leave the office vacant indefinitely. It should be noted, however, that the office was not abolished, not even in Holland and Zeeland.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, Philip II {{sent the}} Duke of Alba to the Provinces to repress the revolt. Alba recaptured the {{southern}} part of the Provinces, who signed the Union of Atrecht, which meant that they would accept the Spanish government on condition of more freedom. But the northern part of the provinces signed the <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> <b>Utrecht</b> and settled in 1581 the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. Spanish troops quickly started fighting the rebels, but before the revolt could be completely defeated, a war between England and Spain had broken out, forcing Philip's Spanish troops to halt their advance. Meanwhile, the Spanish armies had already conquered the important trading cities of Bruges and Ghent. Antwerp, which was then the most important port in the world, also had to be conquered. On 17 August 1585, Antwerp fell. This ended the Eighty Years' War for the (from now on) Southern Netherlands. The United Provinces (the Northern Netherlands) fought on until 1648 – the Peace of Westphalia.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, if {{the office of}} stadtholder was indispensable, the States of the five provinces with a vacancy could and would have {{appointed}} a successor, though not necessarily someone from the Nassau families. As a matter of fact, there were the precedents of Willem IV van den Bergh and Adolf van Nieuwenaar in Gelderland in early Republican times. But the Holland regents did not feel a pressing need to appoint anyone, especially in view of recent events. They acted very quickly to undo the effects of William's coup, freeing the captive regents and reinstating them in their offices. The Gecommitteerde Raden (executive committee) of the States of Holland moved immediately to reassert their authority over the army and convened a plenary session of the States. Next Holland proposed in the States General that a so-called Great Assembly (a kind of constitutional convention) should be convened at short notice, to amend the <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> <b>Utrecht.</b>|$|E
