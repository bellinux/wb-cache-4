5|$|Paleo-Indians {{visited the}} area about 12,000 {{years ago but}} did not leave much archaeological {{evidence}}. Northern Shoshone created trails through the Craters of the Moon Lava Field during their summer migrations from the Snake River to the camas prairie, west of the lava field. Stone windbreaks at Indian Tunnel were used to protect campsites from the dry summer wind. No evidence exists for permanent habitation by any Native American group. A hunting and gathering culture, the Northern Shoshone pursued elk, bears, American bison, cougars, and bighorn sheep— all large game who no longer range the area. The most recent volcanic eruptions ended about 2,100 years ago and were likely witnessed by the Shoshone people. Shoshone legend speaks of a serpent on a mountain who, angered by lightning, coiled around and squeezed the mountain <b>until</b> <b>liquid</b> rock flowed, fire shot from cracks, and the mountain exploded.|$|E
2500|$|The {{temperature}} change produced during a Joule–Thomson expansion is quantified by the Joule–Thomson coefficient, [...] This [...] coefficient may be either positive (corresponding to cooling) or negative (heating); the regions where each occurs for molecular nitrogen, N2, {{are shown in}} the figure. Note that most conditions in the figure correspond to N2 being a supercritical fluid, where it has some properties of a gas and some of a liquid, but can not be really described as being either. The coefficient is negative at both very high and very low temperatures; at very high pressure it is negative at all temperatures. The maximum inversion temperature (621 K for N2) occurs as zero pressure is approached. For N2 gas at low pressures, [...] is negative at high temperatures and positive at low temperatures. At temperatures below the gas-liquid coexistence curve, N2 condenses to form a liquid and the coefficient again becomes negative. Thus, for N2 gas below 621 K, a Joule–Thomson expansion {{can be used to}} cool the gas <b>until</b> <b>liquid</b> N2 forms.|$|E

5000|$|In biryani, {{meat and}} rice are cooked {{separately}} before being layered and cooked together. Pulao is a single-pot dish: meat and rice are simmered in a <b>liquid</b> <b>until</b> the <b>liquid</b> is absorbed. However, some other writers, such as Holly Shaffer (based on her observations in Lucknow), R. K. Saxena and Sangeeta Bhatnagar have reported pulao recipes {{in which the}} rice and meat are cooked separately and then mixed before the dum cooking.|$|R
50|$|To make a thermoporometry / cryoporometry measurement, {{a liquid}} is imbibed into the porous sample, the sample cooled <b>until</b> all the <b>liquid</b> is frozen, and then warmed <b>until</b> all the <b>liquid</b> is again melted.

Dr. Edgar Gretener, his chief assistant at the ETH, was project leader for the development of Eidophor. This project was transferred to a company founded by Gretener, which later became Gretag AG. After years of development, Eidophor achieved commercial success <b>until</b> <b>Liquid</b> Crystal Display LCD (another invention with important Swiss contributors) and Digital Light Processing DLP video projectors became available.|$|E
50|$|To {{prepare the}} fruit, seeds are removed. To remove the seeds, apples are cored and cherries, plums and {{apricots}} are pitted. Grape skins {{are separated from}} the pulp. The pulp is cooked <b>until</b> <b>liquid,</b> then strained to remove the seeds. The strained pulp and skins are then combined and cooked further.The fruit butter is prepared by cooking the fruit, including the skins, in water until soft. Skins are retained to improve the flavor, texture, and color. Once the fruit is soft, sugar may be added, if desired. Prune and apricot butter generally require no added sugar. The fruit butter then is cooked slowly, adding water {{so that it does}} not burn, until both thickened and macerated to the desired extent. The lekvár is filled in jars and the jars are steamed and locked.|$|E
5000|$|To {{determine}} the viscosity of a liquid, the cup is dipped and completely {{filled with the}} substance. After lifting the cup out of the substance the user measures the time <b>until</b> the <b>liquid</b> streaming out of it breaks up, this is the corresponding [...] "efflux time".|$|R

5000|$|Torture was rampant. Iron wire {{was used}} to pierce the ears of 'bad elements', while women were {{stripped}} and suspended by their hair. In {{the words of a}} leader in Jieshou county, 'their breasts were twisted <b>until</b> <b>liquid</b> oozed out'. In Linquan, the use of violence was summarised as follows by the local party boss: 'People died in tragic circumstances, being beaten and hanged to death, deprived of food or buried alive. Some were severely tortured and beaten, having their ears chopped off, their noses dug out, their mouths torn off, and so on, which often caused death. We discovered how extremely serious all of this was once we started investigating.' Murder was common. In Dahuangzhuang, a small village in Linquan, nine out of nineteen cadres had killed at least one villager during the famine. Li Fengying, a team leader, killed five people.|$|E

First, if the machine was put into the barn with the main burner lighted, {{it would have been}} extinguished automatically when the steam in the boiler reached its given pressure, but {{what is known as the}} pilot light would have remained burning. If there happened to be a leak in the gasoline tank or pipes, allowing the dry gas to escape <b>until</b> <b>liquid</b> gasoline forced its way down into the burner and was ignited by the pilot light, an explosion would have ensued. The accident could have happened if the big burner had been automatically extinguished and the pilot light blown out accidentally by a gust of wind, allowing the gas to escape and come in contact with a bare light in the barn." ...|$|E

5000|$|Cars with nitrous-equipped engines can be {{identified}} by the [...] "purge" [...] of the delivery system that most drivers perform prior to reaching the starting line. A separate electrically operated valve is used to release air and gaseous nitrous oxide trapped in the delivery system. This brings liquid nitrous oxide {{all the way up}} through the plumbing from the storage tank to the solenoid valve or valves that will release it into the engine's intake tract. When the purge system is activated, one or more plumes of nitrous oxide will be visible for a moment as the liquid flashes to vapor as it is released. The purpose of a nitrous purge is to ensure that the correct amount of nitrous oxide is delivered the moment the system is activated as nitrous and fuel jets are sized to produce correct air / fuel ratios, and as liquid nitrous is denser than gaseous nitrous, any nitrous vapor in the lines will cause the car to [...] "bog" [...] for an instant (as the ratio of nitrous / fuel will be too rich) <b>until</b> <b>liquid</b> nitrous oxide reaches the intake.|$|E
50|$|Polyamide {{material}} is heated <b>until</b> <b>liquid</b> (typically at 410F/210C). The hot liquid Polyamide {{material is}} then injected {{at very low}} pressure, typically 50 to 200 psi (3.5 to 14 bar) into a relative cold mold-set (65F/18C). The low viscosity polyamide material flows gently into the mold-set cavity and around the electronics to be encapsulated. It also starts cooling down {{as soon as it}} touches the mold-set cavity and the electronics. A mold-set cavity is typically filled in a few seconds but a typical full molding cycle is 20 to 45 seconds. As the Polyamide material starts to cool down it also starts to shrink. Continuous injection pressure is therefore applied to the cavity, even after its initial fill. This is done in order to compensate for the shrinkage that naturally occurs when the Polyamide material goes from liquid to solid (i.e. hot to cold). The Polyamide temperature is not too hot for the electronics and does not re-melt or re-flow the solder. This is simply because the relative cold mold-set will absorb the brunt of the heat, thereby reducing the temperature that a circuit board may see. Millions of circuit boards are successfully over-molded without causing any harm in the process. A low injection pressure does not stress a fragile solder joint.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two ways}} of making daechu-cha: boiling dried jujubes or {{diluting}} the preserved jujubes into boiling water. Preserved jujubes {{can be made by}} simmering dried—preferably sun-dried— jujubes on low heat for about eight hours to a day, <b>until</b> the <b>liquid</b> becomes sweet and syrupy. A pre-made sweet jujube syrup is also commercially available in Korean grocery stores.|$|R

5000|$|A tantric Saiva text, the Mālinīvijayottaratantra, warns: If {{his mouth}} fills with a {{slightly}} salty liquid that smells of iron then he should not drink it but spit it out. He should practice thus <b>until</b> <b>liquid</b> becomes sweet-tasting. Bhattacharyya defines [...] as [...] "name of Yogic posture which bestows spiritual attainment and enables one to overcome disease and death." [...] He explains that [...] "Kha denotes brahman, and that power which moves (cara) as the kinetic energy of brahman is known (as) Khecarī." [...] Singh defines [...] as [...] "the bliss of the vast expanse of spiritual consciousness, also known as divya mudrā or Śivāvasthā (the state of Śivā)." [...] He further identifies it in a higher sense - with the end state of consciousness, {{and not just the}} physical posture used to achieve that end: [...] "So Khecarī Mudrā in Śaiva āgama means a state of universal consciousness which is the state of Śiva." [...] Abhinavagupta, in his Tantraloka, states that all other mudras derive from Khecarī mudrā, which he describes as [...] "the stance of moving or flying through the void of the supreme consciousness." [...] The practice is also mentioned in the Hatha Yoga Pradipika (III. 6-7).|$|E
50|$|After {{the outer}} steel mantle has been cleaned, {{it is again}} lowered over the outer bell model. The mantle and the outer bell mould are then lowered over the inner mould and the outer and inner {{sections}} are clamped together, leaving a space between them. The clamped mould is supported, by being buried in a casting pit which bears the weight of metal and allows even cooling. Ingots of either ready-made bronze or its component metals are melted in a melting furnace and heated <b>until</b> <b>liquid</b> at a temperature of approximately 1100 C. The liquid metal is then skimmed to remove impurities {{before the start of}} the casting process. When everything is ready, the molten bronze is transferred to the moulds using either ladles or a system of brick channels specially constructed in the casting pit, through which the hot metal can then flow from the melting furnace into the space between the two moulds. Holes in the top of the mantle ensure that gases are able to escape. If gas remained in the metal, the bell would be porous and susceptible to cracking. Porousness can also develop if the mould is damp, is not at the proper temperature, or if the metal, when poured, is not hot enough. The bell is allowed to cool for several days. Large bells can take over a week to cool completely. Small bells, those under 500 lb, can be removed from the moulding pit the following day.|$|E
