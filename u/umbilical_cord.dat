5|$|In 2008, {{the body}} of a 38-year-old woman, seven months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in an open field four days after she had disappeared from her residence in Panama. A plastic bag had been left over her head, and she had been gagged; the case was ruled a homicide. The body had suffered from the tropical heat and high humidity, and was bloated and highly discolored. At autopsy, the remains of the fetus were discovered in the woman's undergarments. Although the fetus was in a similar state of decomposition, the <b>umbilical</b> <b>cord</b> was intact and still attached to the placenta inside the uterus.|$|E
5|$|Jaco Van Dormael {{was born}} in Ixelles. Belgium, on 9 February 1957 to a Belgian couple. Van Dormael was raised in Germany until age seven, when his family {{returned}} to Belgium. At his birth, he had nearly been strangled by the <b>umbilical</b> <b>cord</b> and received an insufficient supply of oxygen. It was feared that he may end up mentally impaired. This trauma accounts for the recurring themes in his films, which explore the worlds of people with mental and physical disabilities.|$|E
5|$|Sarcoscypha coccinea {{was used}} as a {{medicinal}} fungus by the Oneida Indians, and possibly by other tribes of the Iroquois Six Nations. The fungus, after being dried and ground up into a powder, was applied as a styptic, particularly to the navels of newborn children that were not healing properly after the <b>umbilical</b> <b>cord</b> had been severed. Pulverized fruit bodies were also kept under bandages made of soft-tanned deerskin. In Scarborough, England, the fruit bodies used to be arranged with moss and leaves and sold as a table decoration.|$|E

40|$|To {{establish}} {{the frequency of}} necrotizing funisitis in congenital syphilis, we conducted a prospective descriptive study of maternal syphilis in Bolivia by testing 1, 559 women at delivery with rapid plasma reagin (RPR). We examined <b>umbilical</b> <b>cords</b> of 66 infants whose mothers had positive RPR and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption tests. Histologic abnormalities were detected in 28 (42 %) <b>umbilical</b> <b>cords</b> (seven [11 %] had necrotizing funisitis with spirochetes; three [4 %] had marked funisitis without necrosis; and 18 [27 %] had mild funisitis), and 38 [58 %] were normal. Of 22 <b>umbilical</b> <b>cords</b> of infants from mothers without syphilis (controls), only two (9 %) showed mild funisitis; the others were normal. Testing <b>umbilical</b> <b>cords</b> by using immunohistochemistry is a research tool that can {{establish the}} frequency of funisitis due to Treponema pallidum infection...|$|R

Out of options, Pentecost reluctantly allows Mako and Raleigh to pilot Gipsy Danger. Gipsy successfully kills Leatherback and Otachi, while almost destroying Hong Kong in the process. Examining Otachi's body, Newton and Hannibal {{find out that}} it is pregnant.

5|$|In 2007, a 23-year-old {{woman in}} India, over eight months pregnant, hanged herself after contractions had begun. A viable infant was spontaneously {{delivered}} unassisted from the woman's body, which was suspended by the neck. The healthy infant {{was found on}} the floor, still tethered to the body of the mother by the <b>umbilical</b> <b>cord.</b> The primary cause of the delivery was the otherwise normal contractions, which had begun prior to death, and was therefore not related to processes of decomposition. While this is not postmortem fetal extrusion, it may be referred to as a case of postmortem delivery, a term which is applied to a broad range of techniques and phenomena with a resultant delivery of a live infant.|$|E
5|$|The gestational period {{lasts for}} about {{eight and a}} half months, after which a single calf is born. Females in labour do not move away from the female herd and {{repeatedly}} lie down and get up again. Births normally take place in areas with short grass when the cow is in the lying position. She stands up immediately afterwards which causes the <b>umbilical</b> <b>cord</b> to break, vigorously licks the calf and chews on the afterbirth. In spite of regional variations, around 80% of the females give birth to their calves within a period of two to three weeks after the onset of the rainy season - from mid-November to the end of December. Seasonal breeding has also been reported among wildebeest in captivity in European zoos. Twin births have not been reported.|$|E

5|$|The {{next step}} is to apply hair. The hair can either be done in one of two ways; wigging, rooting or microrooting. when rooting hair is added 1-4 hair strands per plug. When microrooting, hair is added strand by strand. This can take up to 30 or more hours per head. Once the hair is finished, the {{original}} vinyl body is weighted with a soft stuffed body filled with pellets/fine glass beads/fiberfill.The weight corresponds with its age to achieve a real effect. Various additions also can be added to give the doll an even more life like appearance. Reborns heads are often weighted, so that owners have to support the head like one would a real newborn. Purchasers can have magnets attached inside the mouth or head for attaching a pacifier or hair bows. Electronic devices that mimic a heart beat, or make the chest rise and fall to simulate breathing are common. Reborns can come with an <b>umbilical</b> <b>cord,</b> baby fat, heat packs to make the reborn warm to the touch, or voice boxes that mimic infant sounds. For preemie dolls, they may come in incubators with a breathing apparatus attached to their nose.|$|E

25|$|The <b>umbilical</b> <b>cord</b> of {{a newborn}} is bluish-white in color. After birth, the <b>umbilical</b> <b>cord</b> is {{normally}} cut, leaving a 1–2inch stub.

40|$|Background: Zidovudine (AZT) {{constitutes}} part of {{the recommended}} regimens for prevention and treatment of HIV- 1 infection. At the same time, AZT as well as HIV- 1 infection itself may induce mitochondrial damage. In this study, we analyzed the impact of prenatal AZT-exposure on mitochondrial alterations in HIV-infected women and their infants. Methods: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) levels in placentas of HIV- 1 infected Tanzanian women with and without prenatal AZT exposure, and in the <b>umbilical</b> <b>cords</b> of their AZT-exposed/unexposed infants were quantified using real-time PCR. Furthermore, we checked for the most common mitochondrial deletion in humans, the 4977 base pair deletion (dmtDNA 4977) as a marker for mitochondrial stress. Results: 83 women fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 30 women had been treated with AZT (median duration 56 days; IQR 43 – 70 days) while 53 women had not taken AZT during pregnancy. Baseline maternal characteristics {{in the two groups}} were similar. The median mtDNA levels in placentas and <b>umbilical</b> <b>cords</b> of women (311 copies/cell) and infants (190 copies/cell) exposed to AZT were significantly higher than in AZT-unexposed women (187 copies/cell; p = 0. 021) and infants (127 copies/cell; p = 0. 037). The dmtDNA 4977 was found in placentas of one woman of each group and in 3 <b>umbilical</b> <b>cords</b> of AZT-unexposed infants but not in <b>umbilical</b> <b>cords</b> of AZT-exposed infants. Conclusions: Antenatal AZT intake did not increase the risk for the common mitochondrial deletion dmtDNA 4977. Our dat...|$|R

40|$|TRAIL is {{a member}} of the TNF family of cytokines that {{influences}} many functions including cell death, immune response and inflammation 1. In a previous study on cul-tured HUVEC we demonstrated that TRAIL is able to activate eNOS and to increase NO release and prostanoid production 1 that play a crucial role in endothelial cells func-tion 2. Since hyperglycaemia can result in endothelial injury, due to a decreased bioavail-ability of NO 3, we investigated the effects of TRAIL and nitric oxide synthase/nitric oxide (NOS/NO) related pathways on the endothelial cells function in <b>umbilical</b> <b>cords</b> derived from Gestational Diabetic women, as a model of chronic in vivo exposure to hyperglycaemia in humans. The expression of sTRAIL and TRAIL-Rs was evaluated on paraffin-embedded sections of <b>umbilical</b> <b>cords</b> obtained from 10 healthy pregnant women (controls) and 10 women affected with GD as well as on mononuclear cells puri-fied from PBMC of 6 controls and 6 GD women. The labelling for sTRAIL, TRAIL-R 1 and TRAIL-R 2 was found significantly higher in GD <b>umbilical</b> <b>cords</b> (venous endothe-lial layer) as compared with controls (p< 0. 05).
