Will warns Jack he cannot simply repair the fracture then and there, {{as it would}} erase key future events and risk a time paradox. Passing a frozen Beth during a stutter, Jack reaches to <b>unfreeze</b> her, but hesitates and leaves. Reaching the Bradbury Pool, Jack and Will travel forward in time, only to find Paul and Monarch waiting for them. Paul is intent on either retrieving the CFR or destroying it. Jack fights and kills him. Hooking the CFR into his time machine, Will asks Jack to jumpstart it with chronon energy. The CFR activates and blasts the area with chronons, fixing the tear and vaporizing Paul. As Will examines the CFR, burnt out from the blast, Jack has a vision of his future self traveling {{to the end of}} time, and begins exhibiting symptoms of chronon syndrome.|$|E

5|$|McKay initiates an anti-Replicator {{field to}} protect them from the Asurans, but Oberoth (David Ogden Stiers) discovers this and sends a wave to {{override}} the field. Weir leaves McKay, confronts Oberoth and uses his power to freeze all the Asurans, even tricking him into believing that he has captured the team, all to buy Sheppard enough time to upload the programme. However, Weir struggles to keep Asurans frozen, and when Sheppard finds her just as she loses control, she orders him to leave her behind as the Asurans <b>unfreeze</b> and capture her. The team escapes without Weir, but end up trapped as they lack the power to make it to hyperspace. They are unexpectedly assisted by the Apollo, who have found Atlantis with Colonel Carter's (Amanda Tapping) help. The Apollo lays down covering fire long enough for the team to land in the fighter bay and carries them back to Atlantis. However, the Apollo is unable to lock onto Doctor Weir and beam her aboard. Now fully powered, Sheppard sends the city to M35-117, a back-up planet, and makes a rough landing onto its ocean. Whilst the team mourns the loss of Weir, McKay regains contact with Stargate Command. Dr. Zelenka (David Nykl) announces that the Asurans have begun their attack against the Wraith, meaning Weir's sacrifice was not in vain. Carter tells Sheppard that they will miss Weir, though Sheppard vows to find her again.|$|E

25|$|By {{defeating}} Russia in 1917 Germany {{was able}} to bring hundreds of thousands of combat troops from the east to the Western Front, giving it a numerical advantage over the Allies. By retraining the soldiers in new storm-trooper tactics, the Germans expected to <b>unfreeze</b> the Battlefield and win a decisive victory before the American army arrived in strength. However, the spring offensives all failed, as the Allies fell back and regrouped, and the Germans lacked the reserves necessary to consolidate their gains.

500|$|The {{development}} team researched unexpected {{ways the}} player could combine Corvo's special powers, such as combining a high jump {{with the ability}} to teleport in order to travel greater distances than either ability allowed independently. Instead of restricting these exploits, the team tried to design levels to accommodate them. The designers did not consider all of the powers they conceived during development, such as a power to become a shadow that could move along walls, to be suitable for the game. Some existing powers went through several revisions: a version of [...] "Bend Time" [...] caused the player to <b>unfreeze</b> enemies when touched; [...] "Possession" [...] allowed the player to control a victim remotely without inhabiting their body, but this offered less challenge. Balancing the effectiveness of the player's powers was considered difficult. Colantonio said, [...] "we wanted to give [...] very strong powers, to make [...] really a badass, {{but at the same time}} we didn't want the game to be too easy." [...] Each power has a duration, mana cost, and other variable properties that allowed the team to effectively scale even the most destructive of abilities by making them costly to use frequently or limiting the time they remain active.|$|E
500|$|Homer takes Bart's sons to a {{cryonics}} {{facility where}} Grampa has been frozen alive {{to prevent a}} disease from killing him. Although a cure has now been discovered, he is kept frozen by Homer because it is cheaper than paying for a nursing home and because Grampa has constantly been rude to him. Homer says to the boys that they should give their father another chance, since he knows Bart loves them. At that point, Bart arrives and apologizes to his sons, admitting how much he treasures them. Touched, the two boys forgive him for not having included them [...] in his life much, while an inspired Homer decides to <b>unfreeze</b> Grampa and forgive him as well. Meanwhile, Lisa goes into the Ultranet to find Zia and discovers a door leading into Zia's private world.

When Zia arrives, Lisa thanks her for looking up to her and the two reconcile at last, and secretly hides her life as a party poser. With the conflicts resolved, Bart and Lisa gather their children in preparation for a new Christmas family photo. Marge arrives with Maggie, who has given birth to a baby girl.

30|$|During <b>unfreezing,</b> {{instructors}} gain {{motivation to}} change through experiencing incongruence {{of their teaching}} goals with the outcomes of their teaching practices. In the next stage, changing, instructors learn, apply, and reflect on new teaching strategies so that their behaviors work toward their desired outcomes. In this stage, teaching strategies are fluid as instructors test and refine new methods. In our previous paper (Hayward, Kogan, and Laursen 2016), we offered evidence from surveys and interviews that instructors did change their instruction in the direction espoused by the workshop. Based on workshop observations, we also argued that the design, conduct, and overarching messages of this workshop series were instrumental in facilitating the <b>unfreezing</b> and changing stages. For example, the workshop’s attention to how IBL strategies could be adapted for different settings helped instructors find ways to teach that were consistent with their own identities and classroom contexts, thus aiding <b>unfreezing</b> and providing a viable, individualized vision of how to change. The workshops were designed to help with changing by incorporating features of effective professional development including active participation and addressing common participant concerns.|$|R

Throughout the story, many characters (including Hitler's own subordinates) often refer him being a tyrannical lunatic. In the animated series Code Monkeys, Hitler is also cryogenically frozen (in carbonite, in reference to Han Solo) and is kept secret by the Hitler family, and the Gamevision crew is invited there because of the game that Dave makes.

Hook walks Emma home and at the door to the loft they share a kiss after Emma jokingly invites him in for coffee with her parents.

Hook runs into a drunk Will Scarlet trying to break into the library and punches him in the face when Will refuses to stop. Hook again is put off by his hand controlling his actions and tells Will that if he informs anyone of what happened he will be a dead man. As Mr. Gold is preparing to go home in his car with flowers Hook enters the passenger door and tells Mr. Gold to replace his hand with the hook. He refuses, saying Hook should've heeded his warnings. Hook threatens to inform Belle (Emilie de Ravin) of the dagger, but Gold then tells Hook that he has swapped the daggers and that Belle has the actual dagger. Mr. Gold says he will replace the Hook once Hook does a favor for him. He refuses to give Hook a definite date or time and Hook states he {{can find a way to}} remove it without magic. Mr. Gold tells Hook that since his magic restored the hand, only his magic can take it off. Enraged, Hook thrusts the hook into Gold's chest.
