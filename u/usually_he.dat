[...] Brown inked the pre-Vortex stories with a brush; when he committed himself to a regular schedule, he felt inking with a brush would be too slow, and switched to cheap markers or pencils to increase his productivity. [...] He continued to use a brush to fill in blacks and to letter his dialogue balloons. [...] Brown came to favour {{the quality of the}} brush again {{toward the end of the}} story's run, but found it slow to work with and thus used it less than he would have preferred. [...] By photocopying before sending the artwork to the printer, Brown could ensure that the copy printed from was sufficiently black.|$|E
500|$|Barrymore and {{his wife}} both {{appeared}} in supporting roles in the 1939 screwball comedy Midnight, her only film role. The New York Times thought the film was [...] "one of the liveliest, gayest, wittiest and naughtiest comedies of a long hard season" [...] and that Barrymore, [...] "the [...] Gehrig of eye-brow batting, rolls his phrases with his usual richly humorous effect". The film {{was inducted into the}} National Film Registry in 2013. Barrymore {{and his wife}} appeared together in the stage farce My Dear Children, which opened in March 1939 at Princeton University's McCarter Theatre. He played the lead role, Allan Manville, an ageing hammy Shakespearean has-been. Because of his failing memory, Barrymore ad-libbed constantly throughout the show. In some points the new additions were an improvement, but he also greeted friends in the audience, and used profanities freely. Nevertheless, the show was a success. Life magazine wrote that [...] "People flock to see , not for polished performance, but because he converts the theater into a rowdy histrionic madhouse. Sometimes he arrives late. Sometimes he is tight. <b>Usually</b> <b>he</b> forgets his lines. But he always puts on a great show." [...] When the show reached Broadway, Life wrote that [...] "Barrymore's return to Times Square was a huge professional triumph". Brooks Atkinson, writing for The New York Times thought that Barrymore was [...] "still the most gifted actor in this country.... Although he has recklessly played the fool for a number of years, he is nobody's fool in My Dear Children but a superbly gifted actor on a tired holiday." [...] Barrymore and his wife continued to argue during the play's run, and she left the play part way through the tour. They attempted a reconciliation when the production reached New York, but the couple divorced in late 1940.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the release}} of their debut album Yes in July 1969 for Atlantic Records, Yes resumed {{extensive}} touring across the UK.

Towards the end of 1969, they booked time at Advision Studios in London during gaps between shows to record Time and a Word. In a November 1969 interview during a tour of Switzerland, Bruford talked about the album, saying Anderson was [...] "pouring out new numbers for us to play ... <b>Usually</b> <b>he</b> writes a tune and we listen to the tape and take it from there". At Advision, Yes were joined by producer Tony Colton, a friend of Anderson's who was also the singer of the rock band Heads Hands & Feet. Phil Carson, the European managing director of Atlantic and {{a fan of the}} band, brought in audio engineer Eddy Offord to assist Colton in the album's production because of his skills and hard work.

2500|$|During {{the last}} two decades - when most of the works shown here were made – the {{activities}} of the poster designer, the printmaker, the illustrator, and the film director have completed each other. Many motive, stylistic features, technical solutions appeared in all of the media and for Orosz it seemingly did not cause any problem to cross the borders of the different genres. When he was drawing a poster <b>usually</b> <b>he</b> did it with the preciseness of illustrators, when he was illustrating a book, he did it with the narrative mood of filmmakers, if he was animating films, sometimes he used the several layers approach of etchers and engravers and for prints he often chose the emblematic simplifying way of depiction of posters. If we call him only a poster designer based on his functional prints, we narrow down his field of activity, we go closer to the truth if we associate him with „postering" [...] as a way of thinking, or if we call his many sided image depicting ourselves and our age as the poster-mirror of István Orosz.

[...] <b>Usually</b> <b>he</b> waits until his sisters already commit an infraction, then he tattles to see his father explode. Rory is his father's favorite, being the boy. He becomes involved in money-making schemes with C.J. He is commonly seen playing {{in the living room}} and mentions wanting a monkey, which he once had by trading some of his father's baseball cards; the monkey was later traded for a guitar, which was short-lived, as Rory annoyed the family with it. He also delights in showing his friends the private aspects of his sister Bridget's life, mentioning once that his friends looted Bridget's underwear drawer. Rory was hit hard by Paul's death and ended up punching a hole in his wall out of anger, cutting his hand. He covered for it saying he burnt it taking a casserole out of the oven. After he enters high school, Rory matures, leaving C.J. to be the er of the family. However, Rory still had his moments.|$|E
