5|$|Social housing {{represents}} {{a little more}} than 17 percent of the city's total residences, but these are rather <b>unevenly</b> distributed throughout the capital: the vast majority of these are concentrated in a crescent formed by Paris's south-western to northern periphery arrondissements.|$|E
5|$|From 1200 onwards, the dialects in Denmark {{began to}} diverge {{from those of}} Sweden. The {{innovations}} spread <b>unevenly</b> from Denmark which created a series of minor dialectal boundaries, or isoglosses, ranging from Zealand {{in the south to}} Norrland, Österbotten and northwestern Finland in the north.|$|E
5|$|A Thousand Leaves is the 10th studio album by the American {{experimental}} {{rock band}} Sonic Youth. It {{was released on}} May 12, 1998, by DGC Records. A Thousand Leaves was the band's first album recorded at their own studio in Lower Manhattan, which was built with the money they had made at the 1995 Lollapalooza music festival. Since the band had an unlimited {{amount of time to}} work in their studio, the album features numerous lengthy and improvisational tracks that were developed <b>unevenly.</b> Three highly experimental extended plays, , , and , were recorded simultaneously with the album.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the 2001 census Kilmuir parish in Skye had 47% Gaelic speakers, with Skye overall having an <b>unevenly</b> {{distributed}} 31%. At that time Tiree had 48% of the population Gaelic-speaking, Lismore 29%, Islay 24%, Coll 12%, Jura 11%, Mull 13% and Iona 5%. Students of Scottish Gaelic travel {{from all over the world}} to attend Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, a Scottish Gaelic college based on Skye.|$|E
5|$|Following the purges and {{subsequent}} recoveries, {{gaps in the}} Doctor Who archive are spread <b>unevenly</b> through its first eleven seasons. Major losses mostly affect First and Second Doctor serials; although two stories are missing just one episode each (The Tenth Planet, Episode 4 and The Web of Fear Episode 3), other stories are lost altogether. Patrick Troughton's era as the Second Doctor is particularly affected; of the fourteen stories comprising his first two seasons, only The Tomb of the Cybermen and The Enemy of the World are complete, and these only exist due to telerecordings later returned from Hong Kong and Nigeria, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In Queensland, koalas are <b>unevenly</b> {{distributed}} and uncommon {{except in}} the southeast, where they are numerous. In New South Wales, they are abundant only in Pilliga, while in Victoria they are common nearly everywhere. In South Australia, koalas were extirpated by 1920 and subsequently reintroduced. Koalas {{can be found in}} habitats ranging from relatively open forests to woodlands, and in climates ranging from tropical to cool temperate. In semi-arid climates, they prefer riparian habitats, where nearby streams and creeks provide refuge during times of drought and extreme heat.|$|E
5|$|Woodward’s own {{judgment}} {{of the war and}} of Bush doesn’t really matter. In the course of four books he has given readers the conversations and documents we need to reach our {{own judgment}}s. He has also, however <b>unevenly</b> and imperfectly, supplied enough synthesis and analysis to make that judgment genuinely informed. Sure, these books can be a slog. But they stand as the fullest story yet of the Bush presidency and of the war that is likely to be its most important legacy.|$|E
5|$|England took a 38-run lead after Australia {{replied with}} 458. Morris contributed only six while batting with vice-captain Lindsay Hassett, {{who had been}} {{promoted}} from the middle order to open while Barnes was still injured; Bradman had overlooked reserve opener Brown. Morris chipped Bedser {{in the air to}} Ken Cranston at mid-wicket to leave Australia at 1/13. Australia slumped to 3/68 before a middle-order fightback took Australia to 458 early on the fourth morning. England declared at 8/365 early on the fifth morning, leaving Australia to chase 404 runs for victory. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley the right to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help to break up the wicket and make the surface more likely to spin and bounce <b>unevenly.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} is {{the least}} symmetric curve of constant width according to two different measures of central asymmetry, the Kovner–Besicovitch measure (ratio of area to the largest centrally symmetric shape enclosed by the curve) and the Estermann measure (ratio of area to the smallest centrally symmetric shape enclosing the curve). For the Reuleaux triangle, the two centrally symmetric shapes that determine the measures of asymmetry are both hexagonal, although the inner one has curved sides. The Reuleaux triangle has diameters that split its area more <b>unevenly</b> than any other curve of constant width. That is, the maximum ratio of areas {{on either side of}} a diameter, another measure of asymmetry, is bigger for the Reuleaux triangle than for other curves of constant width.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} about how effectively the edict was enforced. Supposedly, inflation, speculation, and monetary instability continued, and a black market arose to trade in goods forced out of official markets. The edict's penalties were applied <b>unevenly</b> across the empire (some scholars believe they were applied only in Diocletian's domains), widely resisted, and eventually dropped, perhaps {{within a year of}} the edict's issue. Lactantius has written of the perverse accompaniments to the edict; of goods withdrawn from the market, of brawls over minute variations in price, of the deaths that came when its provisions were enforced. His account may be true, but it seems to modern historians exaggerated and hyperbolic, and the impact of the law is recorded in no other ancient source.|$|E
5|$|Within {{minutes of}} issuing the signal and turning his {{flagship}} HMS Queen Charlotte, Howe's plan began to falter. Many of the British captains had either misunderstood or ignored the signal and were hanging {{back in the}} original line. Other ships were still struggling with damage from Howe's earlier engagements and could not get into action fast enough. The result was a ragged formation tipped by Queen Charlotte that headed <b>unevenly</b> for Villaret's fleet. The French responded by firing on the British ships as they approached, {{but the lack of}} training and coordination in the French fleet was obvious; many ships which did obey Howe's order and attacked the French directly arrived in action without significant damage.|$|E
5|$|Alan Turing, {{and later}} the {{mathematical}} biologist James Murray, described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns: a reaction-diffusion system. The cells of a young organism have genes that can be switched on by a chemical signal, a morphogen, resulting {{in the growth of}} a certain type of structure, say a darkly pigmented patch of skin. If the morphogen is present everywhere, the result is an even pigmentation, as in a black leopard. But if it is <b>unevenly</b> distributed, spots or stripes can result. Turing suggested that there could be feedback control of the production of the morphogen itself. This could cause continuous fluctuations in the amount of morphogen as it diffused around the body. A second mechanism is needed to create standing wave patterns (to result in spots or stripes): an inhibitor chemical that switches off production of the morphogen, and that itself diffuses through the body more quickly than the morphogen, resulting in an activator-inhibitor scheme. The Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction is a non-biological example of this kind of scheme, a chemical oscillator.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{variable}} winds of 20 May, some ships were more heavily engaged than others {{and as a}} result the casualties in the action were <b>unevenly</b> spread. According to the French account of the battle, Renommée suffered 93 killed and wounded, including Commodore Roquebert dead and the first lieutenant and commander of the troops on board both badly wounded, although British accounts give a figure of 145 casualties. The French accounts also demonstrate that Néréide had suffered severely, losing 25 dead including Captain Lemaresquier and 32 wounded (again the British accounts differ, stating that she suffered 130 casualties). Clorinde, which had caused severe damage to Galatea while the British ship was immobile but had failed to support Renommée against Schomberg, lost just one man killed and six wounded. British losses were less severe, although still significant, Galatea losing 16 and 46 wounded, Phoebe seven dead and 24 wounded and Astraea two dead and 16 wounded. Racehorse, despite being badly damaged in her masts and rigging, reportedly suffered no casualties.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Skye was {{overwhelmingly}} Gaelic-speaking, {{but this}} changed between 1921 and 2001. In both the 1901 and 1921 censuses, all Skye parishes {{were more than}} 75 per cent Gaelic-speaking. By 1971, only Kilmuir parish had more than three quarters Gaelic speakers {{while the rest of}} Skye ranged between 50 and 74 per cent. At that time, Kilmuir was the only area outside the Western Isles that had such a high proportion of Gaelic speakers. In the 2001 census Kilmuir had just under half Gaelic speakers, and overall, Skye had 31 per cent, distributed <b>unevenly.</b> The strongest Gaelic areas were in the north and south-west of the island, including Staffin at 61 per cent. The weakest areas were in the west and east (e.g. Luib 23 per cent and Kylerhea 19 per cent). Other areas on Skye ranged between 48 per cent and 25 per cent.|$|E
5|$|Horses, {{originally}} {{acquired from}} Spanish New Mexico, spread widely via native trade networks, reaching the Shoshone of the Snake River Plain by 1700. The Nez Perce, Cayuse, and Flathead people acquired their first horses around 1730. Along with horses came {{aspects of the}} emerging plains culture, such as equestrian and horse training skills, greatly increased mobility, hunting efficiency, trade over long distances, intensified warfare, the linking of wealth and prestige to horses and war, {{and the rise of}} large and powerful tribal confederacies. The Nez Perce and Cayuse kept large herds and made annual long-distance trips to the Great Plains for bison hunting, adopted the plains culture to a significant degree, and became the main conduit through which horses and the plains culture diffused into the Columbia River region. Other peoples acquired horses and aspects of the plains culture <b>unevenly.</b> The Yakama, Umatilla, Palus, Spokane, and Coeur d'Alene maintained sizable herds of horses and adopted some of the plains cultural characteristics, but fishing and fish-related economies remained important. Less affected groups included the Molala, Klickitat, Wenatchi, Okanagan, and Sinkiuse-Columbia peoples, who owned small numbers of horses and adopted few plains culture features. Some groups remained essentially unaffected, such as the Sanpoil and Nespelem people, whose culture remained centered on fishing.|$|E
5|$|In April 1992, South Africa toured West Indies for {{the first}} time, and played their first Test match for 22 years. Ambrose played in all three ODIs, {{all of which were}} won by West Indies. The Test match was the first time West Indies bowled under a new playing {{regulation}} which permitted only one bouncer per over; this seemed to affect the home bowlers, but Ambrose took two for 47 from 36 overs. South Africa began {{the final day of the}} match requiring 79 runs to win with just two batsmen out, but Ambrose and Courtney Walsh took the last eight wickets for 26 runs to bowl West Indies to a 52-run win. On a difficult pitch for batting, the ball bounced <b>unevenly,</b> and both bowlers concentrated on accuracy. Ambrose took six for 34 in the second innings, and was named joint man of the match; in just over 60 overs, he took eight for 81 in the match.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} {{the battle of the}} Glorious First of June the {{previous}} year, rewards for the British victory at Groix were <b>unevenly</b> distributed. Bridport's dispatch to the Admiralty was short and lacking in detail, the only officer commended being Bridport's own flag captain William Domett, whose ship had only joined the action in the last stages. The situation was worsened by the Parliament of Great Britain, which voted thanks for the battle but specifically named only Bridport, Lord Hugh Seymour and Vice-Admiral Sir Alan Gardner of Queen. This omitted not only the numerous captains who had taken part in the battle, but also Vice-Admiral John Colpoys of London, whose ship had been much more heavily engaged than Gardner's. Numerous historians have commented on these unexplained omissions, William James noting that Douglas and Queen Charlotte were particularly unfortunate in this regard as the admiral normally aboard, Rear-Admiral Sir Roger Curtis, was ashore at the court-martial of Captain Anthony Molloy and consequently the ship received no recognition despite being the most heavily engaged of any in the British fleet.|$|E
5|$|Royal {{power in}} Wales was <b>unevenly</b> applied, {{with the country}} divided between the marcher lords along the borders, royal territories in Pembrokeshire and the more {{independent}} native Welsh lords of North Wales. John took a close interest in Wales and knew the country well, visiting every year between 1204 and 1211 and marrying his illegitimate daughter, Joan, to the Welsh prince Llywelyn the Great. The king used the marcher lords and the native Welsh to increase his own territory and power, striking a sequence of increasingly precise deals backed by royal military power with the Welsh rulers. A major royal expedition to enforce these agreements occurred in 1211, after Llywelyn attempted to exploit the instability caused by the removal of William de Braose, through the Welsh uprising of 1211. John's invasion, striking into the Welsh heartlands, was a military success. Llywelyn came to terms that included an expansion of John's power across much of Wales, albeit only temporarily.|$|E
5|$|The {{south tower}} forms an unequal {{pentagon}} in shape, and has three storeys with thick walls. The walls were built {{to contain the}} stairs and garderobes, the <b>unevenly</b> positioned empty spaces weakening the structure, and this meant that two large buttresses had {{to be added to}} the tower during its construction to support the walls. The current floors are Victorian in origin, having been built after the fire of 1830, but the tower remains unglazed, as in the 13th century, with shutters at the windows providing protection in winter. The basement was originally only accessible from the first floor, and would have provided a secure area for storage, in addition to also containing a well. The first floor, which formed the original entrance to the tower, contains a 17th-century fireplace, reusing the original 13th-century chimney. The second floor has been subdivided in the past, but has been restored to form a single chamber, as it would have been when first built.|$|E
5|$|Just {{north of}} the Lexicon-Tirtur {{junction}} was the village of al-Galaa. Prior to the 1967 Six Day War, the village had been {{the site of an}} agricultural project. This agricultural station incorporated several irrigation ditches and specialized Japanese-made machinery. When the Sinai came under Israeli occupation, Israeli soldiers unwittingly mistook the Japanese characters for Chinese ones, leading to the location being labeled 'Chinese Farm' on military maps. Just north and north-west of Chinese Farm was a hill mass known by its Israeli codename 'Missouri'. During Operation Badr, al-Galaa and the Chinese Farm fell within the designated bridgehead of the 16th Infantry Division. Abd el-Hamid's 16th Infantry Brigade occupied and defended these locations. After partaking in the initial canal-crossing, the brigade, {{along with the rest of}} the division, faced an attack by Raviv's brigade on October 9. The Israelis achieved some initial gains, but were repelled by the end of the day. Also located within 16th Division's bridgehead, as of October 13, was the 21st Armored Division. Its units were positioned in the center and the {{north of the}} bridgehead. The 14th Brigade had been involved in the crossing and, along with the 1st Brigade, participated in the Egyptian offensive on October 14; as a result, it had lost half of its operational tank strength. In the aftermath, Oraby's efforts to reorganize and replace armored losses were hampered by frequent artillery barrages and air strikes. On October 15, there were 136 tanks in the Egyptian bridgehead, <b>unevenly</b> split among Oraby's brigades: 66 with the 1st Armored Brigade, 39 with the 14th Armored Brigade, and 31 in the 18th Mechanized Brigade. Despite their heavy losses, the Egyptian forces in the bridgehead outnumbered Reshef's force.|$|E
