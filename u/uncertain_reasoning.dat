40|$|An {{important}} {{topic in}} philosophy and the semantics of natural language {{has been the}} representation and verification of counterfactuals. The majority of approaches have taken a classical view of language where statements can be reasoned about solely {{in terms of their}} truth functions. This has led to several well known problems in the verification of counterfactuals. We take another view, inspired by cognitive linguistics, that language relies on the mappings between the conceptual structures (or domains) so that phenomena such as metaphor, blending and analogy are not exceptional uses of language but rather central aspects. To this end, we present an analysis of counterfactuals based on mapping between different reasoning spaces and the drawing of analogies between these spaces. This analysis is implemented in an artificial intelligence reasoning system. The system, called ATT-Meta, was originally designed for <b>uncertain</b> metaphor-based <b>reasoning</b> (and belief reasoning), and was applied without modification to the task of verification of counterfactuals. This was possible because the system approaches metaphor by a pretence mechanism akin to counterfactual reasoning, and because it already contained powerful mechanisms for resolving conflicts between competing arguments. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the extent to}} which <b>uncertain</b> propositional <b>reasoning</b> can track probabilistic reasoning, and addresses kinematic problems that extend the familiar Lottery paradox. An acceptance rule assigns to each Bayesian credal state p a propositional belief revision method Bp, which specifies an initial belief state Bp(⊤), that is revised to the new propositional belief state B(E) upon receipt of information E. An acceptance rule tracks Bayesian conditioning when Bp(E) = Bp|E (⊤), for every E such that p(E) > 0; namely, when acceptance by propositional belief revision equals Bayesian conditioning followed by acceptance. Standard proposals for uncertain acceptance and belief revision do not track Bayesian conditioning. The “Lockean ” rule that accepts propositions above a probability threshold is subject to the familiar lottery paradox (Kyburg 1961), and we show that it is also subject to new and more stubborn paradoxes when the tracking property is taken into account. Moreover, we show that the familiar AGM approach to belief revision (Harper 1975 and Alchourrón, Gärdenfors, and Makinson 1985) cannot be realized in a sensible way by any uncertain acceptance rule that tracks Bayesian conditioning. Finally, we present a plausible, alternative approach that tracks Bayesian conditioning and avoids all of the paradoxes. It combines an odds-based acceptance rule proposed originally by Levi (1996) with a non-AGM belief revision method proposed originally by Shoham (1987) ...|$|R
