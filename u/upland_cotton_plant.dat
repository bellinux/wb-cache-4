The aim of this work was to select SSR markers which can be used to monitor gene flow from herbaceous to mocó <b>cotton</b> <b>plants,</b> using non transgenic <b>upland</b> <b>cotton</b> as a pollen source. Unique mocó cotton feral populations were identified in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, and mother plants and their seeds were collected. Allele frequencies were studied among fifteen plants from these populations using 64 SSR primer pairs. Ten SSR markers, with alleles exclusive to mocó or upland genotypes, were selected to monitor gene flow by paternity analysis (BNL 3627; 2960; 2572; 3261; 3398; 3948; 3502; 3646 and CIR 094; 097). The collected seeds had none of the <b>upland</b> <b>cotton</b> alleles. The absence of exclusive alleles from <b>upland</b> <b>cotton</b> in the offspring showed that gene flow to mocó cotton was absent or lower than the analysis could detect.

Methods We measured diurnal leaf movement, incident photon flux density (PFD) on leaves, leaf temperature, maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm), PSII photochemical efficiency (ΦPSII), electron transport rate (ETR), photochemical quenching coefficient (qP), non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs) and photorespiration (Pr) in pima and <b>upland</b> <b>cotton.</b> Important findings <b>Upland</b> <b>cotton</b> had higher Pn and Gs than pima cotton. Nevertheless, the ratio of photorespiration rate to gross photosynthetic rate was generally higher in pima cotton. Pima <b>cotton</b> and <b>upland</b> <b>cotton</b> had similar degrees of photoinhibition. Furthermore, pima cotton had generally higher thermal energy dissipation capacity than <b>upland</b> <b>cotton.</b> All results indicated that differences in leaf diaheliotropic movement and Gs in pima <b>cotton</b> and <b>upland</b> <b>cotton</b> resulted in differences of both incident PFD on leaves and leaf temperature. <b>Upland</b> <b>cotton</b> and pima cotton preferentially used electron transport flux and thermal energy dissipation, respectively, for light energy dissipation toward photoprotection to against photoinhibition.

In cDNA-AFLP analysis of 25 DPA (days post anthesis) fiber mRNA, two FLA gene-related transcripts exhibit differential expression between Sea Island cotton (G. barbadense L.) and <b>Upland</b> <b>cotton.</b> Based on the transcript-derived fragment, RACE-PCR and realtime PCR technique, GbFLA 5 full-length cDNA was isolated and its expression profiles were characterized in both <b>cotton</b> <b>plant</b> tissues and secondary cell wall (SCW) fibers in this study. The 1154 bp GbFLA 5 cDNA contains an ORF of 720 bp, encoding GbFLA 5 protein of 239 amino acids residues in length with an estimated molecular mass of 25. 41 kDa and isoelectric point of 8. 63.

40|$|RNA {{silencing}} is a conserved {{mechanism in}} plants that targets viruses. Viral small RNAs (vsiRNAs) {{can be generated}} from viral double-stranded RNA replicative intermediates within the infected host, or from host RNA-dependent RNA polymerases activity on viral templates. The abundance and profile of vsiRNAs in viral infections have been reported previously. However, the involvement of vsiRNAs during infection of the Geminiviridae family member cotton leaf curl virus (CLCuD), which causes significant economic losses in cotton growing regions, remains largely uncharacterized. Cotton leaf curl Multan virus (CLCuMuV) associated with a betasatellite called Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite (CLCuMuB) is a major constraint to cotton production in South Asia and is now established in Southern China. In this study, we obtained the profiles of vsiRNAs from CLCuMV and CLCuMB in infected <b>upland</b> <b>cotton</b> (Gossypium hirsutum) <b>plants</b> by deep sequencing. Our data showed that vsiRNA that were derived almost equally from sense and antisense CLCuD DNA strands accumulated preferentially as 21 - and 22 -nucleotide (nt) small RNA population and had a cytosine bias at the 5 ’-terminus. Polarity distribution revealed that vsiRNAs were almost continuously present along the CLCuD genome and hotspots of sense and antisense strands were mainly distributed in the Rep proteins region of CLCuMuV and in the C 1 protein of CLCuMuB. In addition, hundreds of host transcripts targeted by vsiRNAs were predicted, many of which encode transcription factors associated with biotic and abiotic stresses.

50|$|Before the {{invention}} of the cotton gin in 1793, cotton production was limited to coastal plain areas of South Carolina and Georgia, and, on a smaller scale, along the lower Mississippi River. The cotton gin allowed profitable processing of short-staple cotton, which could be grown in the upland regions of the Deep South. After 1793 the Natchez District rapidly became the leading cotton-producing region in Mississippi. Natchez planters developed new <b>cotton</b> <b>plant</b> hybrids and a mechanized system that fueled the spread of the cotton plantation system throughout the Old Southeast. The demand by European Americans for land to develop for <b>upland</b> <b>cotton</b> drove the removal of Native American tribes from the Southeast after 1830. The central part of this area, extending into Texas, became known as the Black Belt for the fertility of the soil and later the high proportion of slave population.|$|R
