5|$|A {{number of}} {{contemporary}} national political {{issues have been}} influenced by events in Massachusetts, such as the decision in 2003 by the state Supreme Judicial Court allowing same-sex marriage and a 2006 bill which mandated health insurance for all Bay Staters. In 2008, Massachusetts voters passed an initiative decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana. Voters in Massachusetts also approved a ballot measure in 2012 that legalized the medical <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>marijuana.</b>|$|E
5|$|Concerning drugs, Paul {{has criticized}} {{mandatory}} minimums {{that he believes}} have led to unreasonably harsh sentences for repeat offenders. He has highlighted the case of Timothy L. Tyler as particularly unfair. Paul {{does not believe in}} legalizing the recreational use of drugs like marijuana and cocaine, but does not support jailing marijuana users. He supports state laws to legalize the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>marijuana</b> for medical purposes. Paul was one of three U.S. senators in 2015 to introduce a bipartisan bill, CARERS, that would legalize medical marijuana under federal law.|$|E
5|$|As of November 2014, 28 {{states have}} enacted medical {{marijuana}} laws, removed jail time {{for possession of}} small amounts of marijuana, and/or have legalized the possession, distribution, and sale of marijuana outright. The factors which have led to this change are many, {{but some of them}} could include increased support from the medical community for legalization, viable regulatory systems modeled off of alcohol regulation, and the potential for state financial gains from decreased criminal justice costs and increased tax revenues. Although outright legalization for non-medical <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>marijuana</b> has only occurred in four states in the Union, in view of the movements in many states, it is possible that those states will not be alone for long.|$|E

25|$|The {{prevalence}} of libertarian political attitudes is widespread.

25|$|The recent anecdotal {{reports of}} {{positive}} effects of the marijuana derivative cannabidiol for some individuals with treatment-resistant epilepsy give reason for hope.

25|$|In late 2000, Sullivan {{began his}} blog, The Daily Dish. The core {{principle}} of the blog has been the style of conservatism he views as traditional. This includes fiscal conservatism, limited government, and classic libertarianism on social issues. Sullivan opposes government involvement with respect to sexual and consensual matters between adults, such as the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>marijuana</b> and prostitution. He believes recognition of same-sex marriage is a civil-rights issue but expressed willingness to promote it on a state-by-state legislative federalism basis, {{rather than trying to}} judicially impose the change. Most of Sullivan's disputes with other conservatives have been over social issues and the handling of postwar Iraq.|$|E

It features soundtracks written and performed by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released as the album More. Schroeder's inspiration for the film a little bit came from the counterculture tradition of the 1960s, between addiction of drug, sexual freedom and beauty of life that refers New Wave film. Real drugs were used in scenes showing the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>marijuana,</b> heroin, and LSD. Production began in 1968, and the film was partially funded by Jet Films with an executive produced by Les Films du Losange of a slight budget.|$|E
25|$|On November 27, 2012, after {{voters in}} the states of CO and WA voted to legalize {{recreational}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>marijuana,</b> Rep. Diana DeGette (D-CO) introduced a bill {{referred to as the}} 'Respect States and Citizens Rights Act' which aimed to amend the Controlled Substances Act to exclude any state that has legalized marijuana (for medical OR recreational use) from marijuana provisions of the CSA, effectively giving state law precedence over federal law in cases where an individual (or commercial enterprise) is acting within the letter of state law regarding marijuana/cannabis. The bill was referred to committee but died when no further action was taken. The same bill was reintroduced later in the 113th and 114th Congresses, where it died each time.|$|E
25|$|Current {{cannabis}} use {{was found}} to be significantly correlated in a dose-dependent manner with a decline in IQ scores, during the effect of the use. However, no such decline was seen in subjects who had formerly been heavy cannabis users and had stopped taking the drug. The authors concluded that cannabis does not have a long-term effect on intelligence. However this is contradicted by the long term longitudinal study, carried out by Otago and Duke universities,which found that regular <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>marijuana</b> in teenage years affects IQ in adulthood even when the use stops. The drop in IQ was 8 points. Adults smoking marijuana had no lasting effect on IQ. Effects on fetal development are minimal when compared with the well-documented adverse effects of tobacco or alcohol use.|$|E
