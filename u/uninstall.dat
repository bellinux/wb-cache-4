5|$|Symantec {{reports that}} Norton 2010 range of {{products}} feature a cleaner <b>uninstall</b> and over-installs is the recommended update route to 2011.|$|E
5|$|Older {{versions}} of Norton were hard and slow to <b>uninstall,</b> leaving many traces and sometimes completing with errors. However, in the 2009 versions, Symantec featured their own uninstaller, that removes their products {{better and more}} quickly, usually {{in less than a}} minute. Norton Removal Tool is a well known instrument that removes Norton products completely, without any trace. The tool can be downloaded from Symantec's website].|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 2010, Symantec {{released}} the 18.5 version through Norton LiveUpdate. However, this update was later pulled due to numerous {{reports on the}} Norton forums that the update is causing system instability and freeze ups during system scans (both full and quick scans). This issue only affects some customers. Users affected by this update are advised to <b>uninstall</b> the product, run the Norton Removal Tool, and reinstall the 18.1 version from http://www.norton.com/nis11. Symantec later fixed the bugs and re-{{released the}} update.|$|E
50|$|Starting from StarForce 4.0 it {{includes}} a removal service. This service automatically <b>uninstalls</b> StarForce drivers after StarForce protected product is <b>uninstalled.</b> After the drivers are <b>uninstalled,</b> the service <b>uninstalls</b> itself as well.|$|R
50|$|Revo <b>Uninstaller</b> first {{runs the}} {{selected}} program's built-in <b>uninstaller,</b> then searches and removes associated files and registry entries that the <b>uninstaller</b> {{may not have}} removed from the user's drive.|$|R
50|$|The Cydoor {{software}} downloads advertisements from the Cydoor servers, to be {{displayed in the}} Cydoor-supported software. Cydoor consumes about 3.4MB of hard drive space, and cannot be <b>uninstalled</b> using the Windows <b>uninstaller.</b> No <b>uninstaller</b> is provided. Cydoor is often bundled with commercial Peer-to-peer file sharing programs such as Kazaa, iMesh and eXeem.|$|R
5|$|TuneUp Utilities 2003: The {{first version}} {{to have become}} {{available}} in English and French, {{as well as the}} original German language. It consists of 16 individual tools accessible through the Start Center, as well as the Windows start menu. It includes features to clean the hard disks, clean and defragment the Windows Registry, optimize Windows and Internet connection settings and change {{the look and feel of}} Windows. It also provides features targeted at users with an intermediate or advanced level of computer knowledge that enables them to edit the registry, manage running processes, <b>uninstall</b> programs, shred and undelete files, and display system information. In addition to the previously-supported Windows 95 and Windows 98, TuneUp Utilities 2003 also supports Windows 2000, Me and Windows XP.|$|E
25|$|It has no uninstaller, and is {{installed}} {{in such a}} way that inexpert attempts to <b>uninstall</b> it can lead to the operating system to fail to recognize existing drives.|$|E
25|$|The project's aim was {{to enable}} {{existing}} Windows users, unacquainted with Linux, to try Ubuntu without risking any data loss (due to disk formatting or partitioning mistakes). It could also safely <b>uninstall</b> Ubuntu from within Windows.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} <b>uninstaller</b> was different. An {{analysis of}} this <b>uninstaller</b> has been published by Mark Russinovich - who initially uncovered XCP - titled [...] "More on Sony: Dangerous Decloaking Patch, EULAs and Phoning Home". Obtaining the original <b>uninstaller</b> requires one to use a specific browser (Microsoft Internet Explorer) and to fill out an online form with their email address, receive an email, install the patch, fill out a second online form, {{and then they will}} receive a link to the <b>uninstaller.</b> The link is personalized, and will not work for multiple <b>uninstalls.</b> Furthermore, Sony's Privacy Policy states that this address can be used for promotions, or given to affiliates or [...] "reputable third parties who may contact you directly".|$|R
50|$|ZSoft <b>Uninstaller</b> is a {{freeware}} software utility from ZSoft Software for the Microsoft Windows operating system. When {{programs are}} deleted using the default program <b>uninstaller,</b> it may leave behind some files and registry entries. ZSoft <b>Uninstaller</b> {{provides a way}} to completely remove leftover data by taking {{a snapshot of the}} hard drive and registry before and after program installation.|$|R
5000|$|Uninstaller: The <b>Uninstaller</b> is used {{to reverse}} changes in the log. This way, the {{applications}} can be <b>uninstalled</b> because all changes that were made at the times of installation are reversed.|$|R
25|$|All {{installation}} {{operations are}} transactional. In other words, for each operation that Windows Installer performs, it generates an equivalent undo operation that would revert the change {{made to the}} system. In case any script action fails during deferred execution, or the operation is cancelled by the user, all the actions performed until that point are rolled back, restoring the system to its original state. Standard Windows Installer actions automatically write information into a rollback script; package authors who create custom actions that change the target system should also create corresponding rollback actions (as well as <b>uninstall</b> actions and uninstallation-rollback actions). As a design feature, if applied correctly this mechanism will also roll back a failed <b>uninstall</b> of an application to a good working state.|$|E
25|$|A user may install or <b>uninstall</b> an MSI {{package in}} passive mode or silent mode, {{bypassing}} this phase entirely. (Passive mode bypasses the user interface phase but shows a graphical progress bar. Silent mode shows nothing.) During installation, information gathered {{in this phase}} may be supplied beforehand through the command-line interface.|$|E
25|$|Immediate mode. In this phase, Windows Installer {{receives}} instructions, {{either from}} a user or an application, to install or <b>uninstall</b> {{features of a}} product. The requests cause the execution of sequences of actions, which query the installation database to build an internal script describing the execution phase in detail.|$|E
25|$|While a {{major upgrade}} of Internet Explorer can be <b>uninstalled</b> in a {{traditional}} way if the user has saved the original application files for installation, the matter of <b>uninstalling</b> the version of the browser that has shipped with an operating system remains a controversial one.|$|R
50|$|Revo <b>Uninstaller</b> {{can also}} irrecoverably delete files.|$|R

25|$|Some copy-protection {{technologies}} have borrowed from spyware. In 2005, Sony BMG Music Entertainment {{was found to}} be using rootkits in its XCP digital rights management technology Like spyware, not only was it difficult to detect and <b>uninstall,</b> it was so poorly written that most efforts to remove it could have rendered computers unable to function.|$|E
25|$|WeatherStudio has a plugin that {{displays}} a window-panel {{near the bottom}} of a browser window. The official website notes that it is easy to remove (<b>uninstall)</b> WeatherStudio from a computer, using its own uninstall-program, such as under C:\Program Files\WeatherStudio. Once WeatherStudio is removed, a browser returns to the prior display appearance, without the need to modify the browser settings.|$|E
25|$|The {{developer}} of an installer package may write code {{to serve their}} own purpose, delivered as a DLL, EXE, VBScript or JavaScript. This can be executed during the installation sequences, including when the user clicks a button in the user interface, or during the InstallExecuteSequence. Custom Actions typically validate product license keys, or initialize more complex services. Developers should normally provide inverse custom actions for use during <b>uninstall.</b>|$|E

25|$|By December 30, v1.1 {{was on the}} way to stores. Bungie also {{issued a}} {{statement}} on their website telling players who had managed to get a copy of v1.0 to <b>uninstall</b> the game by manually dragging the game's folder to the recycle bin. They also made the v1.1 patch available for download. The gaming press lauded Bungie's handling of the situation, praising their decision to take the financial hit and recall the game.|$|E
25|$|Smart TV {{platforms}} or middleware have {{a public}} Software development kit (SDK) and/or Native development kit (NDK) for apps so that third-party developers can develop applications for it, and an app store so that the end-users can install and <b>uninstall</b> apps themselves. The public SDK enables third-party companies and other interactive application developers to “write” applications once and see them run successfully on any device that supports the smart TV platform or middleware architecture which it was written for, no matter who the hardware manufacturer is.|$|E
25|$|If a spyware {{program is}} not blocked and manages to get itself installed, it may resist {{attempts}} to terminate or <b>uninstall</b> it. Some programs work in pairs: when an anti-spyware scanner (or the user) terminates one running process, the other one respawns the killed program. Likewise, some spyware will detect attempts to remove registry keys and immediately add them again. Usually, booting the infected computer in safe mode allows an anti-spyware program {{a better chance of}} removing persistent spyware. Killing the process tree may also work.|$|E

25|$|Wanting {{to go back}} to his {{interesting}} life, Kyon activates {{the program}} and goes back in time to the Tanabata of three years ago. After meeting up with the future Mikuru, he obtains an <b>uninstall</b> program from the past's Yuki, which needs to be shot at the culprit right after the change in the early hours of December 18. Returning to the present, they find the culprit, Yuki, who had borrowed Haruhi's power to change everyone's memories except Kyon's, giving him the choice of which world he would rather live in. Kyon questions himself about his choice and thinks to himself that a normal world without the SOS Brigade and Haruhi Suzumiya would be calm and peaceful and thinks Yuki was tired of everything she had to do like monitoring Haruhi's behavior and protecting Kyon, but finally decides that his original world was more interesting and fun. Kyon tries to install the program into Yuki but is stabbed by Ryoko, who had retained her psychotic behavior. Before Ryoko can finish him off, he is rescued by future counterparts of Yuki, Mikuru and himself. He wakes up a few days later in a hospital, where the world is back to normal, but almost everyone believes Kyon had been in a coma since December 18 after falling down the stairs. When Yuki mentions to Kyon how the Data Integration Thought Entity would punish her for her actions, Kyon tells her to let them know that if they ever try such a thing, he can tell Haruhi about him being John Smith and have her alter reality so the organization would cease to exist. As December 24 comes and his everyday life returns, Kyon decides there is still time before he has to go back in time to save himself and decides to join in on the Christmas party.|$|E
500|$|The {{complaint}} also {{alleged that}} the defendants made it difficult or impossible for consumers to <b>uninstall</b> the software. Those attempting to remove it through the Windows Control Panel [...] "Add or Remove Programs" [...] function were redirected to a web page telling them {{that they had to}} pay the $29.95 fee to stop the pop-ups. The only way many consumers could regain control of their computers was to pay the fee, or pay a computer technician to remove the software.|$|E
500|$|Media {{coverage}} {{as early}} as January 2006 recounted consumer complaints and mentioned that several anti-spyware companies were buying Google advertisements boasting their product's ability to [...] "Remove Movieland Now". [...] In a report updated February 20, 2008, the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School calls Movieland's MediaPipe component [...] "badware" [...] because [...] "it does not fully disclose what it is installing, does not completely remove all components and 'obligations' during the <b>uninstall</b> process, and modifies other software without disclosure." [...] Richard Stiennon of IT-Harvest referred to Movieland {{as a form of}} [...] "Ransomware" [...] due to its behaviour. As of July 2008, the MediaPipe report is still cited by the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School.|$|E
50|$|The {{main feature}} of ZSoft <b>Uninstaller</b> {{is to remove}} {{unnecessary}} files and registry entries left behind after <b>uninstalling</b> a program. It begins by analyzing the hard drive and registry before the program is installed. The user is then asked to install the program {{that they want to}} analyze. After the program is installed, ZSoft <b>Uninstaller</b> will reanalyze the same hard drive and registry, and compare the differences of the pre-installation with the post-installation. Each difference will be logged and the user can return at any time to delete the program and all of the files that were installed.|$|R
