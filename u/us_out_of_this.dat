500|$|Afterward, Johnson began celebrating {{his fifth}} {{consecutive}} Sprint Cup Series championship. During the celebration, Johnson's crew chief, Chad Knaus commented, [...] "I think finally, finally after pulling this off Jimmie {{will get the}} respect that he deserves. Knowing {{what we had to}} do— come down here and beat them— and we beat them." [...] Hamlin, the points leader before the race, described his disappointment by saying, [...] "I’m disappointed. Our car was lightning fast until that last wreck. When we hit the 16 (Biffle) that knocked the toe-in out. It wasn’t as fast after that. It’s just circumstances but we had a great year. We won the most races (8) and we contended like we have never contended before but circumstances took <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> one. I don’t think the 48 (Johnson) showed the strength this year like they did in the past and that opened the door for the rest of us." [...] Harvick, who finished third in points, stated: ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the morning}} of September 15, Jackson had {{positioned}} nearly 50 guns on Maryland Heights and {{at the base of}} Loudoun Heights, prepared to enfilade the rear of the Federal line on Bolivar Heights. Jackson began a fierce artillery barrage from all sides and ordered an infantry assault for 8 a.m. Miles realized that the situation was hopeless. He had no expectation that relief would arrive from McClellan in time and his artillery ammunition was in short supply. At a council of war with his brigade commanders, he agreed to raise the white flag of surrender. But he would not be personally present at any ceremony. He was confronted by a captain of the 126th New York Infantry, who said, [...] "For 's sake, Colonel, don't surrender us. Don't you hear the signal guns? Our forces are near us. Let us cut our way out and join them." [...] But Miles replied, [...] "Impossible. They will blow <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> place in half an hour." [...] As the captain turned away in disdain, a shell exploded, shattering Miles's left leg. So disgusted were the men of the garrison with Miles's behavior, which some claimed involved being drunk again, it was difficult to find a man who would take him to the hospital. He was mortally wounded and died the next day. Some historians have speculated that Miles was struck deliberately by fire from his own men.|$|E

6000|$|... "O, Lord, have mercy!" [...] said Eliza, sobbing. [...] "If he {{will only}} let <b>us</b> get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> country together, {{that is all}} we ask." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let <b>us</b> get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{hole and}} then throw fire brands into the cave---like we did {{when we were}} after the wildcats," [...] {{suggested}} Giant.|$|R
6000|$|... "Does he {{make any}} {{objection}} to helping <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> hole if we're {{willing to do}} our full share of work?" [...] the Mexican asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll try it," [...] said Uncle John. [...] "Do your best, my man, {{and if you}} {{can help}} <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> bog you shall be amply rewarded." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm steady enough," [...] Mr. Mace replied impatiently. [...] "I want to {{know how}} you're going to get <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> What was the charge, anyhow?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] {{returned}} Betsy, briskly, [...] "we'll {{take your}} word for it, Kaliko. And now let <b>us</b> get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> tunnel {{and into the}} world again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] {{said the}} girl, [...] "let <b>us</b> get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> stuffy, {{underground}} cavern {{and go in}} search of new adventures. I'm sure it has stopped raining." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let <b>us</b> get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> place, and as {{far away}} as {{possible}} under the cover of darkness, and I doubt not I may find a way to bring you to your father's castle," [...] replied Norman of Torn.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all right, Michael," [...] Harley soothed. [...] "Take it easy. Don't hurt yourself. The trouble's over. Anybody'll happen along {{any time}} now and get <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> fix." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother," [...] he said, earnestly, [...] "if Mr. Bartol gets <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> scrape {{will you}} go away with me into some new country and give up this business?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not. If they do, we'll be in a pickle, for I {{guess it}} will be Tom and the others {{who will have to}} get <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> hole." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sure of it, George," [...] said Eliza, looking upward, while {{tears of}} hope and enthusiasm shone on her long, dark lashes. [...] "I feel it in me, that God {{is going to bring}} <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bondage, <b>this</b> very day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll do it, Tim!" [...] {{he cried}} {{in a low}} voice. [...] "Come ahead--let <b>us</b> get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> hotel {{just as soon as}} possible. And on the way downstairs I'll see if I can't lift that cap and overcoat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now, let <b>us</b> get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> place,' said Neigh. He {{proceeded}} at once {{down the}} stairs, followed by Ladywell, who--settling his account at the bureau without {{calling for a}} bill, and directing his portmanteau {{to be sent to}} the Right-bank railway station--went with Neigh into the street.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where now?" [...] he asked. [...] "Or do we stay hidden {{here like}} frightened chicks until {{the war is}} over and the Baron returns to let <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> musty hole?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Scraps {{has a lot}} of brains, even if she IS {{stuffed with}} cotton," [...] {{asserted}} the Wizard. [...] "If her brains can help <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> trouble, we ought to use them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By damn, it's dead," [...] was Captain Doane's comment {{five minutes}} later. [...] "Who'd believe it? A rifle bullet! I wish to heaven {{we could get}} half an hour's breeze of wind to get <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> neighbourhood." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. BRENNAN (angry at {{the lack}} of enthusiasm shown by Eileen). Let <b>us</b> get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> Bill. We're not wanted, that's plain as the nose on your face. It's little she's caring about you, and little thanks she has for all you've done for her and the money you've spent.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will see}} that I shall not be allowed. It is of no use to think about it!" [...] said the girl, with a sigh. [...] "Here, let <b>us</b> get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> broad path, or she may yet come after us--persuade Mrs. Charnock Poynsett it is too cold to stand about--anything {{to break up a}} tete-a-tete." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't it awful? Let <b>us</b> get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> before there's another {{avalanche}} or {{we shall}} be globular silicates and isometric crystals in spite of ourselves," [...] whispered Steve with a panic-stricken air, and they fled from the hailstorm of hard words that rattled about their ears, leaving Mac to enjoy himself in his own way.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{steering}} {{very close}} to the law," [...] his son retorted. [...] "No speculating, now, while I am away; whatever comes in must go towards getting <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> scrape, not to plunging us deeper in the mire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wright {{may think}} we're whipped," [...] Billings was saying; [...] "but that's where {{he makes a}} big mistake. He can't drive <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> town, {{no matter how much}} he may blow, an' it won't be many days before we'll show what's what." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ye'll go to Danville {{and take}} Davy with ye and fight it," [...] {{answered}} Polly Ann, decidedly. [...] "Davy has {{a word to}} say, I reckon. 'Twas he made the mill and scar't that Mr. Potts away. I reckon he'll git <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> fix." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "While noting {{these things}} with an {{interest}} and attention which it now astonishes me to recall I felt myself thrust aside, and Judge Veigh, whom in the intensity and vicissitudes of my feelings I had altogether forgotten, pushed by me into the room. 'For God's sake,' I cried, 'do not go in there! Let <b>us</b> get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> dreadful place!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "None, save my {{love and}} duty. Tell him that, thanks to you, {{although}} still somewhat feeble, I am recovered of my hurt upon {{the ship and}} the fever which I took from the sun, and that if he can make any plan to get <b>us</b> all <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> accursed city and the grip of Morella I will bless his name and yours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, Jeekie. Now {{listen to}} me--you've {{got to get}} <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Asiki-land by <b>this</b> day two months. If you don't, that lady will do {{anything}} to oblige me and no doubt there are more executioners left." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That Captain Ludlow {{would gladly}} {{take some of}} <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> boat, by fair means or by foul, is a fact clear as a bright star in a {{cloudless}} night; and, well knowing a seaman's duty to his superiors, I shall leave him to his choice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Call me no French names, dearies. Call me the Leddy Lindsay or Dame Elspeth, as I {{should be}} at home. We be all Scots here, in one sore stour. If I could win a word to my son, Ritchie, he would soon have <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> place.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems as}} though she must, if she used the towel; but that ain't botherin' me half so much jest now as Dan Fernald is. I reckon he's pretty near wild by this time, an' {{it would be a}} terrible thing if the perlice should come an' drag <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> place, wouldn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The shaken Wilfred was {{led away}} by Father Brown, {{who had an}} easy and {{friendly}} way with him. [...] "Let <b>us</b> get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> horrid place, Mr. Bohun," [...] he said. [...] "May I look inside your church? I hear it's {{one of the oldest}} in England. We take some interest, you know," [...] he added with a comical grimace, [...] "in old English churches." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't do it, any way. Got {{to pick up}} {{mother at}} the corner, {{and that will be}} all I can carry. It's lifting a little; hurry along, Lizzie, and let <b>us</b> get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> as quick is possible," [...] said Uncle Eben, impatiently; for going to a circus with a young family is not an easy task, as every one knows who has ever tried it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look you, William," [...] says I; [...] "let me {{have your}} {{proposal}} for {{putting an end}} to our present way of living first, for that is the case before us, and you and I will talk of the other afterwards. I am not so insensible," [...] said I, [...] "as you may think me to be. But let <b>us</b> get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> hellish condition we are in first." ...|$|R
