25|$|In March 2013, {{the prime}} suspect in the {{unlawful}} killing of Donohoe fled to the United States, according to senior Garda sources. The man - in his 20s and from south Armagh - travelled from Northern Ireland to mainland Britain, before boarding a flight to New York City using a British passport. Police in Ireland, Britain and the United States were powerless to prevent the suspect travelling {{because there was no}} warrant for his arrest. However, it is known that the suspect therefore failed to show for a court sitting in Ireland for separate offences that took place before the incident in Bellurgan, County Louth. Once the suspect landed in the US, security services were made aware of his presence by the Gardaí. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were furnished with the details of the suspect's identity, and the United States Marshals Service (USMS) was tasked with tracking the whereabouts of the suspect. Garda detectives also flew to the <b>US,</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> authorities trace the suspect's movements. The man was given a holiday visa by US officials upon entering the country.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1962 Littleton once again {{traveled}} to Europe, this time to research how glass was taught in universities there. He found nothing that he could bring back to the <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> him educate art students at the University of Wisconsin. At that time, European glass programs were geared solely toward industrial production. Students were not taught hands-on techniques with the material; the craft of working with hot glass was still taught at the factories, under the apprenticeship system. What Littleton did find in Europe was a kindred spirit in glass art, the German Erwin Eisch, who is recognized today as a founder of European studio glass. [...] Eisch {{had set up a}} small work area in his family’s glass factory in Frauenau for the production of his own glass art. [...] Trained as a fine artist in the academies of Germany, he was largely self-taught as a glass blower and at the time produced his work {{with the help of the}} factory’s craftsmen. The friendship begun when Littleton visited Eisch in Frauenau in 1962 lasted for the rest of Littleton’s life, and had profound influence on the work of each. [...] The two spent some of almost every summer together for the next thirty years.|$|E
500|$|The {{continued}} resupply {{of horses}} {{was a major}} issue of the war. One estimate puts the number of horses that served in World War I at around six million, with {{a large percentage of}} them dying due to war-related causes. In 1914, the year the war began, the British Army owned only about 25,000 horses. This shortfall required the <b>US</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> with remount efforts, even before it had formally entered the war. Between 1914 and 1918, the US sent almost one million horses overseas, and another 182,000 were taken overseas with American troops. [...] This deployment seriously depleted the country's equine population. Only 200 returned to the US, and 60,000 were killed outright. By the middle of 1917, Britain had procured 591,000 horses and 213,000mules, as well as almost 60,000camels and oxen. Britain's Remount Department spent £67.5million on purchasing, training and delivering horses and mules to the front. The British Remount Department became a major multinational business and a leading player in the international horse trade, through supplying horses to not only the British Army but also to Canada, Belgium, Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, and even a few to the US. Shipping horses between the US and Europe was both costly and dangerous; American Expeditionary Force officials calculated that almost seven times as much room was needed per ton for animals than for average wartime cargo, and over 6,500horses and mules were drowned or killed by shell fire on Allied ships attacked by the Germans. In turn, New Zealand lost around 3percent of the nearly 10,000horses shipped to the front during the war.|$|E

Keynes wanted incentives for the <b>US</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Britain {{and the rest of}} Europe rebuild after WWII.
