But don't let me talk of misery now; time enough when it comes; ces demoiselles have gone to join the serried ranks of their amiable predecessors. Excuse me--I comprehend your impatience. I will tell you of whom ces demoiselles consist.|$|E

5000|$|In his Testament, Cardinal Andouin Aubert {{founded the}} {{residential}} Collège de Maguelone {{in the city}} of Toulouse, for the benefit of ten poor scholars and a priest to care for them. He made the college his <b>universal</b> heir (residual <b>legatee).</b> Cardinal Jean de Blauzac, his executor, obtained letters from King Charles VI of France to finance the college, and Pope Gregory XI granted him the necessary powers to draw up the Statutes for the college. The College was to be for students in grammar, logic, and the other liberal arts. He left a silver chalice and a gilded paten to each of his benefices. He wrote his own epitaph: ...|$|R
5000|$|Arguing the [...] "renewal" [...] plan {{violated}} the donor's original {{intention of the}} gift, Newcomb's heirs filed and lost two suits against the university to invoke the restrictions of Newcomb's lifetime gifts and bequest in her will. The university stated that by naming Tulane her <b>universal</b> <b>legatee</b> in her will, Josephine Louise Newcomb placed no conditions {{on the use of}} her donations, but entrusted her gifts to the discretion of the Administrators of Tulane University.|$|E
50|$|The {{judgment}} of the Committee was given by Sir Robert Phillimore, a noted expert in ecclesiastical law in England. He addressed the various procedural issues which had been raised by the case, beginning by noting that the church officials had not pressed their objections to the Institut's standing {{to carry on the}} appeal, since the Institut was Brown's <b>universal</b> <b>legatee</b> and therefore had an interest in having the order to pay costs overturned. He also confirmed that the Committee did not think the argument for recusation of the Queen's Bench judges could be sustained. As well, he ruled that the original writ for mandamus was in proper form and gave the court sufficient discretion to craft the remedy sought.|$|E
5000|$|His {{workshop}} is then {{stored in}} boxes and almost forgotten in an attic. Fiebig's work will resurface again {{thanks to the}} persistance of his daughter Raya who will make his work better known from 1975. Joseph Logel a notability of Sélestat close to the painter's family who devoted some writings to Fiebig, became the <b>universal</b> <b>legatee</b> of Fiebig's work. But if he helped to make the work of Fiebig better known, Logel apparently [...] "drained" [...] the bank accounts of Raya, the artist's daughter. In 2006, the former Selestadian official and his son were tried for abuse of weakness to one year of prison probation sentence. Raya Fiebig dies without children in January 2007.|$|E
5000|$|Whitworth died {{without issue}} at Knole on 13 May 1825, when all his honours became extinct. His will was proved on 30 May by the Duchess of Dorset, his <b>universal</b> <b>legatee,</b> the {{personalty}} being sworn under £70,000. The duchess died at Knole on 1 August following, and was buried on 10 August at Withyam, Sussex, twenty-two horsemen following her remains to the grave. Her only son (by her first husband), the fourth Duke of Dorset, having died in 1815 after a fall from his horse, her large property (estimated at £35,000 per annum) was divided between her two sons-in-law, the Earls of Plymouth and De la Warr. [...] "Knole in Kent was judiciously bequeathed to the former, he being the richer {{man of the}} two, on the express condition that his lordship should expend £6,000. per annum on this favourite residence of the Sackvilles for several centuries".|$|E
5000|$|During Richard's absence in the Holy Land {{and during}} his captivity, the Jews of England were harassed by William de Longchamp. The Jewish {{community}} {{was forced to}} contribute toward the king's ransom 5,000 marks, {{more than three times}} as much as the contribution of the City of London. On his return, Richard determined to organise the Jewish community {{in order to ensure that}} he should no longer be defrauded, by any such outbreaks as those that occurred after his coronation, of his just dues as <b>universal</b> <b>legatee</b> of the Jewry. Richard accordingly decided, in 1194, that records should be kept by royal officials of all the transactions of the Jews, without which such transactions would not be legal. Every debt was to be entered upon a chirograph, one part of which was to be kept by the Jewish creditor, and the other preserved in a chest to which only special officials should have access. By this means the king could at any time ascertain the property of any Jew in the land; and no destruction of the bond held by the Jew could release the creditor from his indebtedness. This [...] "Ordinance of the Jewry" [...] was, in practice, the beginning of the office of Exchequer of the Jews, which made all the transactions of the English Jewry liable to taxation by the King of England, who thus became a sleeping partner in all the transactions of Jewish money lending. The king besides demanded two bezants in the pound, that is, 10 per cent, of all sums recovered by the Jews with the aid of his courts.|$|E
40|$|Legacies have an {{important}} influence in the Romanian law, respectively in the succession law. So that the legate {{was defined as the}} legal act encompassed in a testament by which the testator shall designate one or more persons who, at his death, will receive the entire heritage, a fraction of it or specific assets of the testator. Precisely for this reason, the Civil Code covers a number of conditions related to teaching legacies in art. 1128 - 1129, which says that teaching legacy is done according to the typology, namely: <b>universal</b> <b>legatee,</b> legatee with a universal title or legatee with a particular title. In this context, we can define the teaching of the legatee as remission of the goods forming the object of possession of the legatee...|$|E
