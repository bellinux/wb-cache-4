50|$|The term Cone of Uncertainty {{is used in}} {{software}} development where the technical and business environments change very rapidly. However, the concept, under different names, is a well-established basic principle of cost engineering. Most environments change so slowly {{that they can be}} considered static for the duration of a typical project, and traditional project management methods therefore focus on achieving a full understanding of the environment through careful analysis and planning. Well before any significant investments are made, the uncertainty is reduced to a level where the risk can be carried comfortably. In this kind of environment the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>level</b> decreases rapidly in the beginning and the cone shape is less obvious. The software business however is very volatile and there is an external pressure to decrease the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>level</b> over time.

The paper shows that, as relative price <b>uncertainty</b> or price <b>level</b> <b>uncertainty</b> increase, contracts where performance is assured through the posting of a bond become more advantageous than contracts that rely on reputation. Increases in relative price and price <b>level</b> <b>uncertainty</b> make contracting more expensive by increasing the payoff from defaulting on long-term contracts when unfavorable realizations occur. As uncertainty increases, long-term contracting becomes less frequent and reputation plays a smaller role in contracting. Copyright 1993 by Ohio State University Press. ...|$|R

40|$|With a {{stochastic}} price-dependent market demand, {{this paper}} investigates how demand uncertainty and capital constraint affect retailer’s integrated ordering and pricing policies towards seasonal products. The retailer with capital constraint is normalized {{to be with}} zero capital endowment while it can be financed by an external bank. The problems are studied under a low and high demand uncertainty scenario, respectively. Results show that when demand <b>uncertainty</b> <b>level</b> is relatively low, the retailer faced with demand uncertainty always sets a lower price than the riskless one, while its order quantity may be smaller or larger than the riskless retailer’s which depends {{on the level of}} market size. When adding a capital constraint, the retailer will strictly prefer a higher price but smaller quantity policy. However, in a high demand uncertainty scenario, the impacts are more intricate. The retailer faced with demand uncertainty will always order a larger quantity than the riskless one if demand <b>uncertainty</b> <b>level</b> is high enough (above a critical value), while the capital-constrained retailer is likely to set a lower price than the well-funded one when demand <b>uncertainty</b> <b>level</b> falls within a specific interval.

40|$|A Fuzzy Logic System (FLS) is {{generally}} credited with being an adequate methodology for real world applications which {{are subject to}} high <b>uncertainty</b> <b>levels.</b> Recent works have shown that interval type- 2 FLSs can outperform type- 1 FLSs in the applications which encompass high <b>uncertainty</b> <b>levels.</b> However, the majority of interval type- 2 FLSs handle the linguistic and input numerical uncertainties using singleton interval type- 2 FLSs that mix the numerical and linguistic uncertainties to be handled only by the linguistic labels type- 2 fuzzy sets. This {{ignores the fact that}} if input numerical uncertainties were present, they should affect the incoming inputs to the FLS. Even in the papers that employed nonsingleton type- 2 FLSs, the input signals were assumed to have a predefined shape (mostly Gaussian or triangular) which might not reflect the real uncertainty distribution which can vary with the associated measurement. In our previous work, we have presented some of the theoretical basis for generating an adaptive type- 2 fuzzy input which is better able to represent the encountered uncertainty at a given measurement. The nonsingleton type- 2 fuzzy inputs are dynamic and they are automatically generated from data and they do not assume a specific shape about the uncertainty distribution associated with the given sensor. In this paper, we will present an overview on how the adaptive type- 2 input based nonsingleton interval type- 2 FLS can operate in real time.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{defines a}} model to {{evaluate}} the uncertainty in performance indicators (PIs) based on Uncertainty Components (UCs). Methodology: The proposed work consists, in a first stage, of {{an assessment of the}} level of influence that each UC has in a given PI. Based on the questionnaire responses a matrix of UCs vs PIs is presented to show the relevance of the contribution of each UC to the uncertainty associated with a PI. The second stage of the methodology consists on the development of {{a model to}} infer the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>level</b> on a PI based on the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>level</b> of the identified UCs. Findings: A questionnaire referring to the assessment of PIs was applied, and the results provide evidence that UCs influence the PI. A model was developed based on logical relations between the UCs and the overall PI uncertainty, and the number of empirical analyses contribute to validate it. Originality/value: This paper presents a model to infer the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>level</b> of a PI based on UCs. The model can also be applied to propagate uncertainty among multiple related PIs. UCs definitions can guide the development of actions to reduce uncertainty in PIs, thus reducing the risk in the decision making process...|$|E
