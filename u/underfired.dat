These specimens were fired under conditions which produced a normal porcelin enamel and <b>underfired</b> and overfired enamels. The enamel, metal, and interface layer between the enamel were then removed separately, by chemical solution, and radioassays wer made on the solutions and residues. Other authors include: Joseph C.

40|$|Between about 500 A. D. and {{the late}} nineteenth century, clay cooking pots {{associated}} with the Thule culture were produced in the Arctic region. Ethnographic and archaeological records indicate that these vessels were typically <b>underfired</b> (often even unfired), highly porous, and easily broken. Despite these characteristics, the evidence indicates that {{they were used to}} heat water over open fires. In this paper, we examine how Arctic potters were able to produce unsintered vessels capable of holding liquids without disintegrating. We conclude that the application of seal oil and seal blood to the pot’s surface was the key to their success...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Seven {{unglazed}} figurines {{from private}} collections, attributed to Cyfflé’s Terre de Lorraine manufacture in Lunéville (1766 – 1780), {{were subjected to}} porosity and scanning electron microscopic analyses to determine bulk element compositions and the composition and nature of their constituent phases. One figurine bears the mark CYFFLE ́ À. LUNÉVILLE, three the mark TERRE DE LORRAINE. The studied samples pertain to four compositional groupings: (1) Two porous (18 – 20 % water adsorption W. A.) bodies containing milled quartz-rich fritþ anhydrite (former gypsum) þ phyllosilicateþCa-rich matrix; (2) A soft-paste (artificial) porcelain body (10 % W. A.), containing quartzþ calcic plagioclase (An 88 – 95) þ glassy matrix. The latter is inferred to derive from a former frit. A coronitic, amorphous (as revealed by electron backscattered diffraction analysis) reaction rim is visible around the quartzes. The K-rich and Na-poor composition of the frit is best explained as a mixture of potassium nitrate, alum, calcined gypsum, sand, and moderate amounts of salt and soda; (3) A porous (23 % W. A.), hybrid porcelain body with finely milled particles of quartz, mullite-bearing hard-paste porcelain, Na-Ca-siliceous glass and metakaolinite; (4) Three hard-paste porcelain bodies, some with relict quartz, andesine plagioclase (An 37 – 45), pseudo-morphs of kaolinite and the liquidus phase mullite in a glassy matrix.

These wares can contain small amounts of lead (1. 8 wt % PbO) and SO 3 (0. 6 wt%), suggesting the use of lead frit and gypsum. The diversity of Cyfflé’s production is now better recognized.

40|$|Instantaneous soot volume {{fractions}} {{and temperatures}} were {{measured in the}} fuel-rich (<b>underfire)</b> region of turbulent nonpremixed acetylene, propylene, ethylene, and propane flames burning in still air. Large-scale, highly buoyant, pool-like flames were considered, having characteristic residence times greater than 250 ms and burner exit Richardson numbers greater than 18. Measurements were made using an optical probe than involved laser extinction for soot volume fractions and two-wavelength pyrometry for temperatures. Strong correlations were found between soot volume fractions and temperatures for each fuel-relatively independent burner operating conditions and position in the <b>underfire</b> region. This behavior is supportive {{of the existence of}} nearly universal relationships between soot volume and mixture fractions in the <b>underfire</b> region of turbulent nonpremixed flames having large characteristic residence times. <b>Underfire</b> soot is largely confined to a narrow range of mixture fractions (yielding a soot spike) and temperatures. The latter observation supports approximations of constant-temperature soot layers that have been proposed in teh past for estimates of continuum radiation from soot-containing diffusion flames...|$|R
40|$|A {{coke oven}} battery is not {{considered}} as {{a significant source of}} PCDDs/PCDFs emissions; however, due to small amounts of chlorine in coal dioxins, dibenzofurans may be formed. The paper presents the attempts to determine the level of emission of PCDDs/PCDFs from the COB <b>underfiring</b> system and to confront the obtained results with the calculations based on the mass balance of chlorine in the coking process and reactions of both chlorophenols formation and PCDDs and PCDFs formation from mono- and polychlorophenols. There were PCDDs/PCDFs concentrations measured in flue gases from the <b>underfiring</b> system of two COBs at a Polish coking plant. The measurements included both an old and a new battery. The obtained concentrations of PCDDs/PCDFs were lower than reported in the literature (0. 5 - 1. 7 ng I-TEQ/tcoke), while the results for old COB were on average 3 times higher than for the new one. It was found that PCDD/F emission from COB <b>underfiring</b> system is insignificant and that PCDDs/PCDFs formation during coal coking should consider the mechanisms of their formation from mono- and polychlorophenols, as well as the influence of process parameters on the synthesis...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 A {{program of}} {{research}} has been established at Oregon State University to study wood residue combustion using an experimental spreader-stoker combustor. This research was conducted to increase the understanding of combustion occurring in wood fired boilers. Using Douglas Fir screened to 3 / 8 - 3 / 4 inches, two 4 x 4 factorial experiments were conducted varying depth of fuel bed and fuel feed rate. The objective of the experiments was to test the hypotheses that increased fuel bed depth has the statistically significant effects of decreasing particulate emissions and increasing the relative amount of solid carbon oxidized by the <b>underfire</b> air (the Relative Carbon Saturation). The amount of carbon is relative to the maximum amount that could be oxidized by the air. The results of the experiments were that the following effects {{were found to be}} statistically significant. 1. Increasing fuel bed depth from two to four inches decreases particulate emissions. 2. The effect of bed depth on particulate emissions is more pronounced at higher combustion rates. 3. Increasing fuel bed depth from two to four inches increases the Relative Carbon Saturation of the gases produced in the fuel bed. 4. At either fuel bed depth, the Relative Carbon Saturation is decreased by higher combustion rates. The most important results of the research are that a fuel bed several inches thick in a wood fired spreader-stoker can be used to effectively meter the <b>underfire</b> air to reduce particulate emissions and increase the heating value of the gases produced in the fuel bed which become fuel for the overfire combustion. New concepts of combustion mechanisms in wood fired boilers are presented in the thesis and recommendations for further research are offered...|$|R
50|$|The third song, “Unspoken”, {{features}} German rapper Carlprit and {{is about}} a mutual attraction between two lovers and their synchronicity with each other. The title track is an electropop song about conformity and the modern standard of beauty. The song features the use of Auto-Tune on Horler’s vocals along with bleeping synth effects reminiscent of 1980’s electro music. The ninth track from the album, “Sinner On the Dancefloor,” is written about a love affair {{on the dance floor}} and features pin-sharp beats produced by the drum machine, thick eurodance synthesizers, and the Auto-Tune effects on unknown male vocals on the song. “Enemy” is a slinky Euro disco song about a relationship at a standstill. “Hungover” is an obligatory pop ballad with urban influences that resembles the sound of American musician Ryan Tedder’s musical work.

50|$|Before the 1870s in the United States, {{architectural}} decoration {{was fairly}} sparse and largely consisted of wood or hand carved stone; these were both time-consuming and expensive. Experiments with terra cotta for this use {{were done in}} the 1850s; noted architects Richard Upjohn and James Renwick made the earliest use of the new material. At first there were technical difficulties and failures due to <b>underfiring,</b> as well as fierce resistance from stone cutters fearing loss of their livelihood.By the 1870s terra cotta was fast becoming the material of choice, as it was far easier to make, allowed for unlimited designs and could be made rapidly and inexpensively.Large sculptures and decorative schemes were divided into a multitude of blocks {{so that they could}} be reassembled by masons with mortar and metal cramps in place on the steel frames of the new architecture. This protected the steel from fire as well as the elements.The Chicago Terra Cotta Company, Midland Terra Cotta Company, N. Y. Architectural Terra Cotta Co., (Brooklyn 1886), Boston Terra Cotta Company (1880), Boston Valley Terra Cotta Company (NY 1889), Atlantic Terra Cotta Company, Gladding-McBean and many others began production of models, molds and finished ware for architects nationwide.The process started with the architect's or designer's sketches and drawings; sculptors created original models in the factory, usually of clay and sized about 14% larger than the final product to allow for shrinkage. The architects approved the models or suggested changes to them. Once the model was approved, plaster piece molds were made of the clay models. At this point, in order to create many identical multiples, additional molds were made of the model or of the first plaster piece mold.|$|R
