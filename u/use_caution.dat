5|$|Boats {{of nearly}} any variety are {{permitted}} on Lake Erie at Presque Isle State Park. Boats with internal combustion engines are prohibited {{in the interior}} lagoons, except for Grave Yard Pond, where a concession rents motor and pontoon boats, canoes, and kayaks for recreational use. The park also has a 500-slip marina, open to boats up to , and five boat launches. Boat tours provide views of the park, lake, bay, and Erie skyline. All boats must have a current registration from any state. Water conditions on Lake Erie can change with little notice, and boaters are asked to <b>use</b> <b>caution.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the Mission Status briefing, Lead Flight Director Tony Ceccacci {{noted that}} during the camera survey of the {{equipment}} in the payload bay, the team noticed some fine particulate matter around the box containing the Wide Field Camera 3 and asked the crew to take additional images using a higher resolution camera for the ground teams to assess. Cain later confirmed that the dust was not present prior to launch, and was most likely particulate shaken loose from the thick insulation blankets inside the payload bay during launch. The team advised the crew to avoid the particulate {{as much as possible}} during the spacewalks, and <b>use</b> <b>caution</b> when working around the container to avoid the debris, {{but it was not a}} significant concern.|$|E

25|$|Foggerty {{is afraid}} that Spiff will ruin his marriage, but a fairy {{guardian}} named Rebecca arrives and offers help. Foggerty wishes that Spiff did not exist. She gives Foggerty a magic elixir {{that will change}} a past event in his life. Rebecca warns him that all the consequences of any event changed by the elixir will also be changed and that this may lead to unanticipated results. He promises to <b>use</b> <b>caution.</b> She also gives him pills that he can swallow before summoning her. Now Spiff arrives and claims Foggerty in marriage. Jenny calls off the engagement, Walkinshaw is pleased, and in desperation Foggerty drinks the elixir.|$|E
25|$|In the Canadian {{province}} of New Brunswick, collisions with moose are frequent enough that all new highways have fences to prevent moose from accessing the road, as {{has long been}} done in Finland, Norway, and Sweden. A demonstration project, Highway7 between Fredericton and Saint John, which {{has one of the}} highest frequencies of moose collisions in the province, did not have these fences until 2008, although it was and continues to be extremely well signed. Newfoundland and Labrador recommended that motorists <b>use</b> <b>caution</b> between dusk and dawn because that is when moose are most active and most difficult to see, increasing the risk of collisions. Local moose sightings are often reported on radio stations so that motorists can take care while driving in particular areas.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that approximately 68% of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy experience disturbances in sensory perception such as dysgeusia. In a pilot study involving twelve lung cancer patients, chemotherapy drugs were infused with zinc in order to test its potential as a treatment. The results indicated that, after two weeks, no taste disturbances were reported by the patients who received the zinc-supplemented treatment while most of the patients in the control group who did not receive the zinc reported taste alterations. A multi-institutional study involving a larger sample size of 169 patients, however, indicated that zinc-infused chemotherapy did not {{have an effect on the}} development of taste disorders in cancer patients. An excess amount of zinc in the body can have negative effects on the immune system, and physicians must <b>use</b> <b>caution</b> when administering zinc to immunocompromised cancer patients. Because taste disorders can have detrimental effects on a patient's quality of life, more research needs to be conducted concerning possible treatments such as zinc supplementation.|$|E

The Driver must report to Series Officials on pit lane for consultation and/or penalty within four (4) laps or face possible additional disciplinary actions), BLACK WITH ORANGE DISC IN CENTER (shown to the Driver {{with a number}} board from the Starter and/or at designated flag stations on the circuit to advise of a mechanical problem that may endanger the Driver or other competitors. Driver must report immediately to their assigned pit at reduced speed and may not rejoin the session until released by the Technical Director or his designate), YELLOW (local / partial course caution – must reduce speed and line up in single file – no passing), WAVED YELLOW (use great caution!), DOUBLE YELLOW (full course caution – no passing), RED (the session has been stopped – <b>use</b> <b>caution</b> and proceed immediately to pit lane – no passing), and BLACK AND WHITE CHECKERED (completion of practice, qualifying, or race).|$|E
25|$|People {{who suffer}} from dysgeusia are also forced to manage the impact that the {{disorder}} has on their quality of life. An altered taste has effects on food choice and intake {{and can lead to}} weight loss, malnutrition, impaired immunity, and a decline in health. Patients diagnosed with dysgeusia must <b>use</b> <b>caution</b> when adding sugar and salt to food and must be sure not to overcompensate for their lack of taste with excess amounts. Since the elderly are often on multiple medications, they are at risk for taste disturbances increasing the chances of developing depression, loss of appetite, and extreme weight loss. This is cause for an evaluation and management of their dysgeusia. In patients undergoing chemotherapy, taste distortions can often be severe and make compliance with cancer treatment difficult. Other problems that may arise include anorexia and behavioral changes that can be misinterpreted as psychiatric delusions regarding food. Symptoms including paranoia, amnesia, cerebellar malfunction, and lethargy can also manifest when undergoing histidine treatment. This makes it critical that these patients' dysgeusia is either treated or managed in order to improve their quality of life.|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the trails}} {{in the park}} are {{difficult}} and hikers are urged to <b>use</b> <b>caution,</b> especially on the Falls Trail, which is steep and often wet and slippery. Each year hikers fall in the glens {{and have to be}} rescued, which usually takes dozens of volunteers and up to 11hours because of the remote locations and rugged terrain.

500|$|The player {{proceeds}} through 24 missions {{divided into}} several [...] "phases" [...] each, making 72 levels in all. There are various settings including medieval, gangster-themed Chicago, an alien spacecraft and an alien planet. The player must also contend with mines and other booby traps. As well as shooting action, the game features strategy elements and employs a point-and-click control system more common to strategy than action games. As the player's troops are heavily outnumbered and easily killed, he must <b>use</b> <b>caution,</b> {{as well as}} careful planning and positioning. To this end, he can split the squad into smaller units to take up separate positions or risk fewer soldiers when moving into dangerous areas. In alternative settings, heavy weapons are replaced graphically by such units as battering rams (replaces trucks) and wizards (replaces rockets).|$|E

The park has areas set aside for trap shooting, and archery, participants are required to bring their own equipment and restrictions apply. For anglers, Loon Lake is stocked in the spring and fall with rainbow trout and a small one-half acre pond to the east of the lake is stocked annually for children during the National Hunting and Fishing Days, which is marked yearly by events at Silver Springs. The Fox River is open for fishing from both the bank and boats. There are no motor restrictions and a boat launch is available at the park.
