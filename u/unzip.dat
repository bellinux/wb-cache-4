In the restroom, he starts to <b>unzip,</b> then realizes that the bathroom {{is attached to a}} large white room with many men in white coats ready to observe and take notes on his performance. He then meets Buffy, Giles, and Spike in a playground; Spike – unaffected by daylight – tells him that Giles is going to teach him to be a Watcher, as Buffy plays in a sandbox. Xander then finds himself in an ice cream truck with Anya; Willow and Tara (wearing skimpy clothing and garish make-up) are in the back, and they invite him to join them. He tries to do so, only to end up in the basement where his parents allow him to live. He goes to the university and comes across Giles, who starts revealing the reason for the dream, but who suddenly switches to speaking in French. Xander next finds himself in a reenactment of the Apocalypse Now scene between a captive Captain Benjamin Willard and Colonel Walter Kurtz, with Principal Snyder as Kurtz. Throughout the sequence Xander finds himself in his basement again and again, chased by an unseen pursuer, who is revealed as the First Slayer when she tears his heart out.|$|E
25|$|The {{degradation}} of polymers to form smaller molecules may proceed by random scission or specific scission. The {{degradation of}} polyethylene occurs by random scission—a random breakage of the bonds that hold the atoms of the polymer together. When heated above 450°C, polyethylene degrades to form a mixture of hydrocarbons. Other polymers, such as poly(alpha-methylstyrene), undergo specific chain scission with breakage occurring only at the ends.

A remarkable specific capacitance of 33 Fg- 1 was obtained for the <b>unzipped</b> MWCNTs at a current density of 1 Ag- 1 in 0. 5 M KCl solution compared with 8 Fg- 1 for pristine MWCNTs, again confirming the enhanced effective surface area and increased defect density in the tube surfaces after the <b>unzipping</b> process.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) from {{chemical}} <b>unzipping</b> {{of carbon}} nanotubes (CNTs) {{have been reported}} to be a suitable candidate for lithium ion battery materials, but very few of them focused on controlling GNRs with different <b>unzipping</b> levels. Here we present a study of GNRs with controlled <b>unzipping</b> level and the prevailing factors that affect the lithium storage performance at early and final <b>unzipping</b> level; besides, the effect of thermal reduction has been investigated. On the basis of Raman and BET surface area tests, we found that the <b>unzipping</b> of CNTs starts with surface etching and then proceeds to partial and full <b>unzipping</b> and finally fragmentation and aggregation. Galvanostatic charge−discharge reveals that defect increase is mainly responsible for the capacity enhancement at the early <b>unzipping</b> level; surface area drop is associated with the capacity fade at the final <b>unzipping</b> level. Surface functional groups can result in low electrical conductivity and therefore cause capacity drop within several cycles. The GNRs with controlled <b>unzipping</b> level display different electrochemical behaviors and thus can provide rational choices for researchers who are searching for desired functions using GNRs as additives in lithium ion batteries. 1...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{have used}} the {{nanometer}} scale a-Hemolysin pore to study the <b>unzipping</b> kinetics of individual DNA hairpins under constant force or constant loading rate. Using a dynamic voltage control method, the entry rate of polynucleotides into the pore and the voltage pattern applied to induce hairpin <b>unzipping</b> are independently set. Thus, hundreds of <b>unzipping</b> events can be tested {{in a short period}} of time (few minutes), independently of the <b>unzipping</b> voltage amplitude. Because our method does not entail the physical coupling of the molecules under test to a force transducer, very high throughput can be achieved. We used our method to study DNA <b>unzipping</b> kinetics at small forces, which have not been accessed before. We find that in this regime the static <b>unzipping</b> times decrease exponentially with voltage with a characteristic slope that is independent of the duplex region sequence, and that the intercept depends strongly on the duplex region energy. We also present the first nanopore dynamic force measurements (time varying force). Our results are in agreement with the ~log (_V) dependence at high _V (where _V is the loading rate) observed by other methods. The extension of these measurements to lower loading rates reveals a much weaker dependence on _V...|$|R
