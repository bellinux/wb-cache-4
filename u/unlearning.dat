25|$|The modern {{roots of}} CBT {{can be traced}} to the {{development}} of behavior therapy in the early 20th century, the development of cognitive therapy in the 1960s, and the subsequent merging of the two. Groundbreaking work of behaviorism began with John B. Watson and Rosalie Rayner's studies of conditioning in 1920. Behaviorally-centered therapeutic approaches appeared as early as 1924 with Mary Cover Jones' work dedicated to the <b>unlearning</b> of fears in children. These were the antecedents of the development of Joseph Wolpe's behavioral therapy in the 1950s. It was the work of Wolpe and Watson, which was based on Ivan Pavlov's work on learning and conditioning, that influenced Hans Eysenck and Arnold Lazarus to develop new behavioral therapy techniques based on classical conditioning. One of Eysenck's colleagues, Glenn Wilson showed that classical fear conditioning in humans could be controlled by verbally induced cognitive expectations, thus opening a field of research that supports the rationale of cognitive behaviorial therapy.|$|E

[...] Ilene Strizver, {{founder of the}} Type Studio, says, [...] "Forget about tolerating differences of opinion: typographically speaking, typing two spaces {{before the start of}} a new sentence is absolutely, unequivocally wrong." [...] The Complete Manual on Typography (2003) states that [...] "The typewriter tradition of separating sentences with two word spaces after a period has no place in typesetting" [...] and the single space is [...] "standard typographic practice". [...] The Elements of Typographic Style (2004) advocates a single space between sentences, noting that [...] "your typing as well as your typesetting will benefit from <b>unlearning</b> this quaint [...] Victorian habit".|$|E

2500|$|According to the {{regression}} hypothesis, two similar approaches developed. Cohen started to conduct several studies {{on his own}} to determine [...] "whether the last things learned are, in fact, the first things to be forgotten, and whether forgetting entails <b>unlearning</b> in reverse order from the original learning process" [...] (Cohen 1975: 128). He observed the attrition of Spanish, as the second language, among school children during the summer vacation. Cohen's results supported {{the regression}} hypothesis and his last-learned-first-forgotten thesis. It supported the idea that some things, which are learned last, {{are the first to}} be forgotten when the learner has no input of the target language anymore.|$|E

She had once imagined otherwise, and most of her life had been the slow <b>unlearning</b> of that initial error. She had imagined that the hostels were hers simply because he had put it in that way.

50|$|An <b>unlearned</b> {{appetite}} is {{one that}} an animal possesses at birth, without conditioning through prior stress followed by alleviation with specific foods. An <b>unlearned</b> appetite suggests a physiological mechanism for detecting {{the absence of a}} nutrient as well as a signalling component that directs the animal to seek out the missing nutrient. An example of an <b>unlearned</b> appetite might be caloric appetite, as seen in all domestic animals. Other <b>unlearned</b> appetites are more difficult to demonstrate. In one study, protein-deficient rats that had not previously experienced protein deficiency demonstrated strong preferences for high-protein foods such as soybean, gluten, and ovalbumin within thirty minutes of food presentation. This preference was not seen in controls, and was also exhibited by pregnant females with higher protein needs who were not experimentally protein-deficient. Rats also seem to have an <b>unlearned</b> appetite for calcium and sodium. In addition, zinc-depleted chicks show preferences for zinc-rich feeds.|$|R
40|$|Behavioural {{responses}} {{are influenced by}} knowledge acquired during the lifetime of an individual and by predispositions transmitted across generations. Establishing the origin of knowledge {{and the role of}} the <b>unlearned</b> component is a challenging task, given that both learned and <b>unlearned</b> knowledge can orient perception, learning, and the encoding of environmental features since the first stages of life. Ethical and practical issues constrain the investigation of <b>unlearned</b> knowledge in altricial species, including human beings. On the contrary, precocial animals can be tested on a wide range of tasks and capabilities immediately after birth and in controlled rearing conditions. Insects and precocial avian species are very convenient models to dissect the knowledge systems that enable young individuals to cope with their environment in the absence of specific previous experience. We present the state of the art of research on the origins of knowledge that come from different models and disciplines. Insects have been mainly used to investigate <b>unlearned</b> sensory preferences and prepared learning mechanisms. The relative simplicity of the neural system and fast life cycle of insects make them ideal models to investigate the neural circuitry and evolutionary dynamics of <b>unlearned</b> traits. Among avian species, chicks of the domestic fowl have been the focus of many studies, and showed to possess <b>unlearned</b> knowledge in the sensory, physical, spatial, numerical and social domains. Solid evidence shows the existence of <b>unlearned</b> knowledge in different domains in several species, from sensory and social preferences to the left-right representation of the mental number line. We show how non-mammalian models of cognition, and in particular precocial species, can shed light into the adaptive value and evolutionary history of <b>unlearned</b> knowledge...|$|R
60|$|I went {{abroad for}} the general election, and if I don't know how much, on the Continent, I forgot, I at least know how much I missed, him. At a distance, in a foreign land, ignoring, abjuring, <b>unlearning</b> him, I {{discovered}} {{what he had done}} for me. I owed him, oh unmistakeably, certain noble conceptions; I had lighted my little taper at his smoky lamp, and lo it continued to twinkle. But the light it gave me just showed me how much more I wanted. I was pursued of course by letters from Mrs. Saltram which I didn't scruple not to read, though quite aware her embarrassments couldn't but be now of the gravest. I sacrificed to propriety by simply putting them away, and this is how, one day as my absence drew to an end, my eye, while I rummaged in my desk for another paper, was caught by a name on a leaf that had detached itself from the packet. The allusion was to Miss Anvoy, who, it appeared, was engaged to be married to Mr. George Gravener; and the news was two months old. A direct question of Mrs. Saltram's had thus remained unanswered--she had enquired of me in a postscript what sort of man this aspirant to such a hand might be. The great other fact about him just then was that he had been triumphantly returned for Clockborough {{in the interest of the}} party that had swept the country--so that I might easily have referred Mrs. Saltram to the journals of the day. Yet when I at last wrote her that I was coming home and would discharge my accumulated burden by seeing her, I but remarked in regard to her question that she must really put it to Miss Anvoy.|$|E
60|$|Once every {{people in}} the world {{believed}} that trees were divine, and could take a human or grotesque shape and dance among the shadows; and that deer, and ravens and foxes, and wolves and bears, and clouds and pools, almost all things under the sun and moon, and the sun and moon, were not less divine and changeable. They saw in the rainbow the still bent bow of a god thrown down in his negligence; they heard in the thunder the sound of his beaten water-jar, or the tumult of his chariot wheels; and when a sudden flight of wild duck, or of crows, passed over their heads, they thought they were gazing at the dead hastening to their rest; while they dreamed of so great a mystery in little things that they believed the waving of a hand, or of a sacred bough, enough to trouble far-off hearts, or hood the moon with darkness. All old literatures are full of these or of like imaginations, and all the poets of races, who have not lost this way of looking at things, could have said of themselves, as the poet of the Kalevala said of himself, 'I have learned my songs from the music of many birds, and from the music of many waters.' When a mother in the Kalevala weeps for a daughter, who was drowned flying from an old suitor, she weeps so greatly that her tears become three rivers, and cast up three rocks, on which grow three birch-trees, where three cuckoos sit and sing, the one 'love, love,' the one 'suitor, suitor,' the one 'consolation, consolation.' And the makers of the Sagas made the squirrel run up and down the sacred ash-tree carrying words of hatred from the eagle to the worm, and from the worm to the eagle; although they had less of the old way than the makers of the Kalavala, for they lived in a more crowded and complicated world, and were learning the abstract meditation which lures men from visible beauty, and were <b>unlearning,</b> it may be, the impassioned meditation which brings men beyond the edge of trance and makes trees, and beasts, and dead things talk with human voices.|$|E
6000|$|This had become, of a sudden, the {{simplest}} {{thing in the}} world-- the sense of which moreover seemed really to amount to a portent that he should feel, forevermore, on the general head, conveniently at his ease with her. He went in fact a step further than Charlotte--put the latter forward as creating his necessity. She was staying over luncheon to oblige their hostess--as a consequence of which he must also stay to see her decently home. He must deliver her safe and sound, he felt, in Eaton Square. Regret as he might, too, the difference made by this obligation, he frankly didn't mind, inasmuch as, {{over and above the}} pleasure itself, his scruple would certainly gratify both Mr. Verver and Maggie. They never yet had absolutely and entirely learned, he even found deliberation to intimate, how little he really neglected the first--as it seemed nowadays quite to have become-- of his domestic duties: therefore he still constantly felt how little he must remit his effort to make them remark it. To which he added with equal lucidity that they would return in time for dinner, and if he didn't, as a last word, subjoin that it would be [...] "lovely" [...] of Fanny to find, on her own return, a moment to go to Eaton Square and report them as struggling bravely on, this was not because the impulse, down to the very name for the amiable act, altogether failed to rise. His inward assurance, his general plan, had at moments, where she was concerned, its drops of continuity, and nothing would less have pleased him than that she should suspect in him, however tempted, any element of conscious [...] "cheek." [...] But he was always--that was really the upshot--cultivating thanklessly the considerate and the delicate: it was a long lesson, this <b>unlearning,</b> with people of English race, all the little superstitions that accompany friendship. Mrs. Assingham herself was the first to say that she would unfailingly [...] "report"; she brought it out in fact, he thought, quite wonderfully--having attained the summit of the wonderful during the brief interval that had separated her appeal to Charlotte from this passage with himself. She had taken the five minutes, obviously, amid the rest of the talk and the movement, to retire into her tent for meditation--which showed, among several things, the impression Charlotte had made on her. It was from the tent she emerged, as with arms refurbished; though who indeed could say if the manner in which she now met him spoke most, really, of the glitter of battle or of the white waver of the flag of truce? The parley was short either way; the gallantry of her offer was all sufficient.|$|E

6000|$|You ask me [...] "why I do not brandish my {{tomahawk}} and, like Walt [...] Whitman, {{raise my}} barbaric yawp over {{the roofs of}} all the houses." [...] It is because I am not yet a [...] "cosmos" [...] as that gentleman avowedly [...] is, but only a very dim nebula, doing its modest best, no doubt, to [...] solidify into cosmical dimensions, but still requiring an [...] "awful [...] sight" [...] of time and pains and patience {{on the part of}} its friends. [...] You evidently fancy that cosmoses are born to all the faculty they [...] shall ever have, like ducks: no such thing. There is no respectable [...] cosmos but what is born to such a vapoury and even gaseous [...] inheritance as requires long centuries of conflict on its part to [...] overcome the same and become pronounced or educated in its proper [...] mineral, vegatable or animal order. Ducks are born perfect; that is [...] to say they utter the same unmodified unimproved quack on their [...] dying pillow that they uttered on their natal day; whereas cosmoses [...] are destined to a life of such surprising change that you may say [...] their career is an incessant disavowal of their birth, or that [...] their highest maturation consists in their utter renunciation of [...] their natural father and mother. You transcendentalists make the [...] fatal mistake of denying education, of sundering present from past [...] and future from present. These things are indissolubly one, the [...] present deriving its consciousness only from the past, and the [...] future drawing all its distinctive wisdom from our present [...] experience. The law is the same with the individual as it is with [...] the race: none of us can dodge the necessity of regeneration, of [...] disavowing our natural ancestry in order to come forth in our own [...] divinely-given proportions. The secret of this necessity ought to [...] reconcile us to it, however onerous the obligation it imposes; for [...] that secret is nothing more nor less than this, that we cosmoses [...] have a plenary divine origin and are bound eventually to see that [...] divinity reproduced in our most familiar and trivial experience, [...] even down to the length of our shoe-ties. If the Deity were an [...] immense Duck capable only of emitting an eternal quack we of course [...] should all have been born webfooted, each as infallible in his way [...] as the Pope, nor ever have been at the expense and bother of [...] swimming-schools. But He is a perfect man, incapable of the [...] slightest quackery, capable only of every honest and modest and [...] helpful purpose, and these are perfections to which manifestly no [...] one is born, but only re-born. We come to such states not by [...] learning, only by <b>unlearning.</b> No natural edification issues in [...] spiritual architecture of this splendour, but only a natural [...] demolition or undoing. I dimly recognise this great truth, and [...] hence hold more to a present imbecility than to a too eager [...] efficiency. I feel myself more fit to be knocked about for some [...] time yet and vastated of my natural vigour than to commence cosmos [...] and raise the barbaric yawp. Time enough for that when I am fairly [...] finished. Say what we will, you and I are all the while at school [...] just now.
