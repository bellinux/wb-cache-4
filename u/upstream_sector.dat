However, licensing in downstream sectors has {{a negative effect on}} productivity of suppliers of intermediate inputs.

Oil majors are not only characterized by their dominating power but also by their great concern with health, safety and environmental protection.

India's state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation is the largest oil company. ONGC is the leading player in India's <b>upstream</b> <b>sector,</b> accounting for roughly 75% of the country's oil output during 2006, as per Indian government estimates. As a net importer of all oil, the Indian Government has introduced policies aimed at growing domestic oil production and oil exploration activities. As part of the effort, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas crafted the New Exploration License Policy (NELP) in 2000, which permits foreign companies to hold 100% equity possession in {{oil and natural gas}} projects. However, to date, only a handful of oil fields are controlled by foreign firms.

This discovery, along with subsequent discoveries of huge oil and gas fields in Western offshore changed the oil scenario of the country. Subsequently, over 5 billion tonnes of hydrocarbons, which were present in the country, were discovered. The most important contribution of ONGC, however, is its self-reliance and development of core competence in E&P activities at a globally competitive level.|$|E
