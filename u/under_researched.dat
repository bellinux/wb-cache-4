50|$|As Zen {{practice}} has expanded throughout the United States {{over the last}} fifty years, the variety of Zen centers has increased. While some are now the homes of wealthy communities in major cities (such as Zen Center of Los Angeles), and some are in traditional mountain settings (such as Yokoji Zen Mountain Center), other Zen centers have either humble or no permanent physical location - meeting in members private homes, university classrooms, and Quaker Meeting Houses to name but a few examples. While large and established Zen centers may serve as the residence of priests, monks, and lay people, smaller and more rural Zen centers may have no ordained members. Although some recent studies have been made regarding Zen in America, the area remains <b>under</b> <b>researched,</b> and still quite heterogeneous.|$|E
50|$|As our {{healthcare}} system and {{society as a}} whole becomes increasingly reliant on technology, it is inevitable that the availability and use of CBTI software will also expand. The potential of the internet for extending the use of CBTIs has been recognized, although the potential problems associated with this modality have yet to be fully understood and will need to be addressed before the use of internet-based CBTI utilization proliferates. In addition, the application of computer-adaptive testing, although successfully applied in other assessment domains (i.e., ability and aptitude), provides a promising, yet <b>under</b> <b>researched</b> addition to personality assessment. Lastly, there is a call for the more effective integration of clinical and computer-based prediction methods, beginning with a partnership between clinicians and researchers in the development of CBTI programs.|$|E
