5|$|These fossils {{have been}} {{preserved}} in a distinctive style known as Burgess shale type preservation, which preserves fairly tough tissues such as cuticle as thin films, and soft tissues as solid shapes, quickly enough that decay has not destroyed them. Moderately soft tissues, such as muscles, are lost. Scientists are still <b>unsure</b> <b>about</b> {{the processes that}} created these fossils. While {{there is little doubt}} that the animals were buried under catastrophic flows of sediment, it is uncertain whether they were transported by the flows from other locations, or lived in the area where they were buried, or were a mixture of local and transported specimens. This issue is closely related to whether conditions around the burial sites were anoxic or had a moderate supply of oxygen. Anoxic conditions are generally thought the most favourable for fossilization, but imply that the animals could not have lived where they were buried.|$|E
40|$|Frequent Shopper {{programs}} are becoming ubiquitous in retailing. Retailers seem <b>unsure</b> however <b>about</b> whether these {{programs are}} leading to higher loyalty, or to higher profits. In this paper we analyze data from a US supermarket chain that has used a number of frequent shopper rewards to improve sales and profitability. We find that while {{these programs are}} profitable, this is only because substantial incremental sales to casual shoppers (cherry pickers) oset subsidies to already loyal customers. In this way our findings are inconsistent with existing theories about how frequent shopper programs are supposed to work. We construct our own Hotelling-like model that explicitly models cherry picking behavior and show that its predictions match the data quite closely. We further test the predictions of our model by characterizing the impact of such programs on trip frequency and basket size. We then use the model to examine more complex scenarios. For example, our analysis suggests that frequent shopper programs may be unprofitable if they eliminate all cherry picking. This may explain why some retailers seem dissatisfied with their programs. We end by proposing a solution that retains {{the benefits of the}} frequent shopper programs and yet continues to let supermarkets benefit fro...|$|R

5000|$|... ==Origin== The {{origin of}} the name [...] "Gjin" [...] is unclear, {{except for the fact}} that he is {{considered}} a Christian saint by Albanians. The Catholic clergy consider Shën Gjin (Saint Gjin) to be the same saint as Shën Gjon (Saint John) but the Christians of the Central Albanian Shpati region (who are Orthodox)) revere the two as separate saints with two different saint days-- 21 May for Shën Gjon, but 24 June for Shën Gjin. Linguists also are <b>unsure</b> etymologically <b>about</b> the derivation of Gjin, especially, once again, whether it has the same source as Gjon. If Gjin does not have the same source as Gjon, it is difficult to find any Christian source of the name despite Gjin being considered a Christian saint among Albanians. Krahe and Lambertz have theorized that Gjin is in fact a Christianization of a pre-Christian Albanian figure, arguing in particular that the original name of the figure in ancient times was Gentius before it was mutated over time. If so, Gjin could be not the only Albanian Christian saint with a non-Christian origin, as another saint is also thought to be of pre-Christian origin: Shën Premti which shares the origin of Premte, the Albanian word for Friday, and is thought to share the {{origin of the}} ancient goddess Prende, the Albanian equivalent of Roman Venus, Norse Freyja and Greek Aphrodite [...] but was identified by the Catholic Church with the martyr Saint Anne.|$|R
5|$|Between the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, Mr. Prospector, Cup Bearer, Ecole Etage, Champagne Charlie, and Step Nicely, none of {{whom had}} run in the Derby, were all named as {{possible}} entrants. Three horses, Secretariat, Sham, and Our Native, all raced in the Kentucky Derby two weeks prior. On May 15, seven owners confirmed their intentions to enter their horses by paying a US$1,000 deposit. The horses officially registered that day were Our Native, Secretariat, and Sham, along with new runners Deadly Dream, Ecole Etage, The Lark Twist, and Torsion. A day later, Deadly Dream's trainer stated that he was <b>unsure</b> <b>about</b> racing his colt because he felt the horse could not match Secretariat, Sham, or Our Native. In addition, The Lark Twist's owner Larry Boyce scratched his horse from the race because he received word that Our Native registered, dropping {{the total number of}} horses competing to six. However, on the 17th, Boyce attempted to re-enter The Lark Twist, but was denied under the Rules of Racing of Maryland which stated that the scratching of a horse was irreversible.

In October 1952, at the 19th Party Congress, Stalin restructured the party's leadership. His request, voiced through Malenkov, to be relieved of his duties in the party secretariat due to his age, was rejected by the party congress, as delegates were <b>unsure</b> <b>about</b> Stalin's intentions. In the end, the congress formally abolished Stalin's office of General Secretary, though Stalin remained one of the party secretaries and maintained ultimate control of the Party. When Stalin died on 5 March 1953, Malenkov was the most important member of the Secretariat, which also included Nikita Khrushchev, among others. Under a short-lived troika of Malenkov, Beria, and Molotov, Malenkov became Chairman of the Council of Ministers but was forced to resign from the Secretariat nine days later on 14 March, leaving Khrushchev in effective control of the body. Khrushchev was elected to the new office of First Secretary at the Central Committee plenum on 14 September of the same year. Originally conceived as a collective leadership, Khrushchev removed his rivals from power in both 1955 and (especially) 1957 and reinforced the supremacy of the First Secretary.|$|E

Under the belief that he had attended the Hollywood Stuntman's School, Gillette was offered the role of Jason Voorhees. Initially Gillette was <b>unsure</b> <b>about</b> the character, but the idea of starring in his first film grew on Gillette, and he also thought the role was amusing. It became apparent Gillette could not perform the necessary stunts, so the stunt coordinator Cliff Cudney brought in Steve Daskawisz. Daskawisz filmed all of the scenes except the opening sequence and the unmasking shot at the end; Gillette returned for the unmasking scenes. Gillette received credit for playing Jason, while Daskawisz was given credit as the stunt double. When Part 3 was released the following year, Daskawisz was credited as Jason for the reused footage from the climax of the film. Initially, Daskawisz was asked to return to the role for Part 3, but it would have required him to pay for his own transportation and housing during filming.

In addition, the study explored their perceptions about critical thinking and its teaching in classrooms with an aim to develop learning and teaching process. The study was conducted with twenty-nine male students at a teacher education program in the College of Education, King Saud University. The quantitative method was used, employing a three-part instrument. The quantitative data was analyzed with SPSS software program (ver. 20. 0), using sums, {{means and standard deviations of}} pre-service teachers’ responses on the questionnaires. According to the findings of the current study, pre-service teachers who were enrolled in the College of Education were found to have inadequate knowledge about critical thinking skills. Although, the present study concluded that pre-service teachers held positive opinions about the value of teaching critical thinking, they generally had <b>unsure</b> knowledge <b>about</b> critical thinking.

The current study recommends that education preparation programs are in need to be reviewed and specialized courses in critical thinking skills need to be incorporated. Pre-service teachers’ knowledge about critical thinking should be enhanced to enable them reflect what they have of skills on their future teaching duties. More exploration is suggested to explore critical thinking knowledge among college teachers and to examine their methods of teaching critical thinking.

Methods: All adult patients with mental capacity attending the de-partment for a CT study over a week period were invited {{to fill out a}} brief questionnaire prior to their scan. Results: 57 patients returned completed questionnaires. Overall 23 % of patients were <b>unsure</b> or incorrect <b>about</b> the type of scan scheduled. Of patients attending with a new condition, 46 % of them did not know their provisional diagnosis. Only 32 % of patients had insight into how a CT scan worked. This was taken to mean that the patient had included some refer-ence to either x-rays, radiation or cross sectional imaging. Only 23 % of patients were aware of potential complications of CT scans. Conclusion: Although written consent prior to CT scan is probably a step too far in providing patients with relevant risks/benefits of their investigation, we propose all patients undergoing CT have prior access to a written information sheet should they wish to be further informed regarding their procedure...|$|R
5|$|Nobuo Uematsu was {{the chief}} music {{composer}} of the Final Fantasy series until his resignation from Square Enix in November 2004. Other composers include Masashi Hamauzu, Hitoshi Sakimoto and Junya Nakano. Uematsu was allowed to create much of the music with little direction from the production staff. Sakaguchi, however, would request pieces to fit specific game scenes including battles and exploring {{different areas of the}} game world. Once a game's major scenarios were completed, Uematsu would begin writing the music based on the story, characters, and accompanying artwork. He started with a game's main theme, and developed other pieces to match its style. In creating character themes, Uematsu read the game's scenario to determine the characters' personality. He would also ask the scenario writer for more details to scenes he was <b>unsure</b> <b>about.</b> Technical limitations were prevalent in earlier titles; Sakaguchi would sometimes instruct Uematsu to only use specific notes. It was not until Final FantasyIV on the SNES that Uematsu was able to add more subtlety to the music.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the episode came from Matt Groening, who had wanted to do an episode in which Mr. Burns was shot, {{which could be used}} as a {{publicity}} stunt. The writers decided to write the episode in two parts with a mystery that could be used in a contest. It was important for them to design a mystery that had clues, took advantage of freeze frame technology, and was structured around one character who seemed to be the obvious culprit. While deciding who the culprit was, Oakley and Weinstein pitched Barney Gumble because he was a character that could go to jail and it could change the dynamic of the show. Mirkin suggested Maggie because he felt it was funnier and wanted the culprit to be a Simpsons family member. Oakley and Weinstein were initially <b>unsure</b> <b>about</b> having Maggie as the culprit, and it was decided that the episode would end with Maggie shifting her eyes and making it look like it was not a complete accident.|$|E

40|$|The problem {{presented}} in Le Spleen D’Ash is of identity, paralysis, and the Lyric. “Ash” {{serves as a}} representation of traditional connotations—a fire’s remains, a resurrection, the ash tree—as well as a symbol for the Lyric “I” in the poems: a plea toward my own voice in the manuscript. Placing honestly into a book is normal, and, when combined with abstract ideas, builds a foreign yet simultaneously comfortable frame for the poems. The presence of a named speaker, Ash, is a common practice, {{but the fact that}} my speaker is also metaphorically complex adds further dimensions. Familiar images like a whale become skewed so the reader isn’t sure their imagined whale is or can be the whale in the poem. A Dutch baby is simultaneously a breakfast pastry and infant. The poems work against their object’s familiarity to push the reader into an <b>unsure</b> space <b>about</b> their own perceptions of the meaning and purpose of the poems. Though these poems were not written with strict rules or restrictions, very specific processes produced the majority of the manuscript. Forms of communicating over distances—ex. celestial navigation, echo location, or telegraph—play {{a key role in the}} development of the movement in some poems: language structures designed to inform and define various communications are excised and used as forms of action in the poems. Research in these fields was necessary in order to develop an understanding of the languages of the communications. Translation is also important to this collection. As mentioned above, one goal of these poems is to create an uneasy feeling surrounding the preconceived notion of an image and what the poem attempts to imagine in itself. This toying manifests in a homophonic translation of Charles Baudelaire’s “Spleen. ” My goal here is to capture the meaning of Baudelaire’s “Spleen” in a brutal and forceful language that demands an increased commitment from the reader to push themselves into the uncomfortable space with these poems. If conclusions can be made in poems, Le Spleen D’Ash does not supply any beyond identifying with poetry’s abstract ideals. The purpose here is not to conclude, but rather supply a lens for thought; provoke questions of authenticity; and show the guttural honesty of the spleen in Ash. The Lyric isn’t meant to provide a conclusion but a portrait, and this, I feel, is accomplished...|$|R
40|$|Healthcare {{consultations}} with patients lacking English proficiency are challenging for all parties, even in Australian primary care where the engagement of interpreters is encouraged and fully subsidised. Our {{objective was to}} understand these challenges {{from the perspectives of}} interpreters, patients and general practitioners in order to improve the effectiveness of interpreted consultations. Our investigator team approached the interpreted consultation as an interprofessional collaboration. A convenience sample of seven general practitioners, eight health interpreters and six representatives from culturally and linguistically diverse communities (representing the patient perspective) participated in three separate focus group discussions, lasting 60 - 90  min each, exploring participant experiences with healthcare consultations in which interpreters were present. Two semistructured interviews were undertaken subsequently with three additional community representatives purposively recruited to increase participant diversity. Data were collected in 2016 and analysed inductively using a method of constant comparison to identify, and reach consensus on, key emerging themes. All participant groups emphasised the importance of working with trained interpreters, rather than relying on family interpreters or a doctor 2 ̆ 7 s own second language skills. Although participants reported experiences of effective interpreted consultations, other reports suggested that some doctors are unaware of, or have difficulty following, accepted guidelines about speech, gaze and turn-taking. Challenges identified in relation to interpreted consultations fell into the five themes of contextual constraints, consultation complexity, communication difficulties, the interpreter role and collaboration. Some general practitioner participants appeared to be <b>unsure</b> and anxious <b>about</b> the etiquette of interpreted consultations, and there was some confusion between and within participant groups about interpreter roles and professional codes. A briefing session prior to the consultation, clarifying the roles of all parties, including any family or bicultural workers present, may help to establish respectful, flexible and effective interprofessional collaborations and to encourage participants to directly address any problems during the consultation...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} study examines {{the voices of}} six first year university students as they encounter the formal structured learning environment of an Australian university. The study is situated within a context of the changing landscape of tertiary education in Australia, particularly {{as it relates to}} what is commonly called “the first year experience” (FYE). The emergence {{over the last two decades}} of a number of theoretical perspectives on the FYE have informed this study, including student engagement and satisfaction with the university experience. Within these perspectives the negotiated engagement of the modern student is discussed. It is against these theoretical perspectives that the interviews of the students are explored as they journey through the formal learning structures of lectures and tutorials and through the processes and academic relationships that support these structures. The aim of this study is to determine what engagement the traditional university learning structures of lectures and tutorials created for these six individual students. I also explored the academic relationships these students formed with their lecturers and tutors within these structures and their expectations about how they would learn and become knowledgeable in their discipline through these structures. The research design was situated within a qualitative paradigm. The framework of interpretivism was selected as it provides opportunities for a view of the reality in terms of the constructions of the six participants. In listening to the “voices” of the students I was able to grasp their meanings and then reconstruct the meanings into an interpretation. Within this framework of interpretivism I chose case studies using interviews as the key data collection method. Through the articulation of their learning experiences over both semesters, I was able to gain an insight into the issues involved in the transition to formal university structures for each of the six students. The students in this study were unclear about their role as learners in the formal university learning environment. In particular, university structures (such as lectures and tutorials) were alien to their previous encounters with formal education and they were <b>unsure</b> and confused <b>about</b> the nature and extent of their participation [...] All of the participants quickly adjusted their expectations when confronted with the same formal structures in second semester. The responses gained through this research cast these students as journey makers, engaging in rapid construction, deconstruction and reconstruction of the academic environment and the structures and processes within it. This study contributes to educational practice by raising questions about the type of learning structures and processes universities set up for first year students. It questions the quality of structures such as lectures and tutorials for all students. Importantly, it challenges the role of academics in facilitating better “signposts” to aid perseverance in the learning journey and success in an “alien place”...|$|R
