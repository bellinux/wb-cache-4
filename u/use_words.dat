5|$|Infants <b>use</b> <b>words</b> to {{communicate}} {{early in life}} and their communication skills develop as they grow older. Communication skills aid in word learning. Infants learn to take turns while communicating with adults. While preschoolers lack precise timing and rely on obvious speaker cues, older children are more precise in their timing and take fewer long pauses. Children get better at initiating and sustaining coherent conversations as they age. Toddlers and preschoolers use strategies such as repeating and recasting their partners' utterances to keep the conversation going. Older children add new relevant information to conversations. Connectives such as then, so, and because are more frequently used as children get older. When giving and responding to feedback, preschoolers are inconsistent, but around the age of six, children can mark corrections with phrases and head nods to indicate their continued attention. As children continue to age they provide more constructive interpretations back to listeners, which helps prompt conversations.|$|E
5|$|Matangi {{represents}} {{the power of}} the spoken word (Vaikhari) as an expression of thoughts and the mind. She also relates to the power of listening and grasping speech and converting it back to knowledge and thought. Besides spoken word, she also governs all other expressions of inner thought and knowledge, like art, music and dance. Matangi presides over the middle part of speech (Madhyama), where ideas are translated into the spoken word and in her highest role, represents Para-Vaikhari—the Supreme Word manifested through speech and that encompasses knowledge of the scriptures. She is described as the goddess of learning and speech, and the bestower of knowledge and talent. She is also called Mantrini, the mistress of the sacred mantras. She also {{represents the}} word of a guru, who serves as a spiritual guide. Matangi is described as dwelling in the Throat chakra—the origin of speech—and on the tip of the tongue. She is also associated with a channel called Sarasvati from the third eye to the tip of the tongue. According to David Frawley, her description as impure refers {{to the nature of the}} spoken word, which labels things and stereotypes them, thereby hindering actual contact with the soul of things. The goddess is described as one who helps a person to <b>use</b> <b>words</b> in the right way and to go beyond it to seek the soul and inner knowledge, which lie outside the demarcated boundaries of tradition.|$|E

The study also examined the interrelationship among word processing experience, method of composition, and quality of business writing. The purpose of the study was to produce research results to assist business communication teachers, budget administrators, and business writers. The results will assist them in determining the extent to which they will integrate computer-related composition activities into their business communication courses and offices. The study, which was conducted during fall semester, 1987, at the University of North Texas, used a posttest-only control group design, with a pretest to equate groups. It included 104 students enrolled in the introductory business communication course. Half of the students composed a business letter by hand and half did so <b>using</b> WordPerfect <b>word</b> processing software. The students' letters were then graded using a letter evaluation form containing 17 business writing quality categories.

[...] "I decided I was going to <b>use</b> <b>words</b> more, and say things. I wrote 'Well Respected Man'. That was the first real word-oriented song I wrote. ... abandoned any attempt to Americanise my accent." [...] The Kinks' allegiance to English styles was strengthened by the ban placed on them by the American Federation of Musicians. The ban cut them off from the American record buying public, the world's largest musical market, forcing them to focus on Britain and mainland Europe. The Kinks expanded on their English sound throughout the remainder of the 1960s, fusing music hall and folk, and creating some of the most influential and important music of the period.|$|E

Janet Maslin of The New York Times panned Jasmine: [...] "the sloe-eyed Princess Jasmine... a nymph in harem pants, <b>use</b> <b>words</b> like 'fabulous' and 'amazing' to express unremarkable thoughts", concluding, [...] "Luckily, [...] surrounded by an overpowering array of secondary characters who make the film's sidelines much more interesting than its supposed center."

500|$|Children <b>use</b> <b>words</b> {{differently}} for objects, spatial {{relations and}} actions. Children ages {{one to three}} often rely on general purpose deictic words such as [...] "here", [...] "that" [...] or [...] "look" [...] accompanied by a gesture, which is most often pointing, to pick out specific objects. Children also stretch already known or partly known words to cover other objects that appear similar to the original. This can result in word overextension or misuses of words. Word overextension is governed by the perceptual similarities children notice among the different referents. Misuses of words indirectly provide ways of finding out which meanings children have attached to particular words. When children {{come into contact with}} spatial relations, they talk about the location of one object with respect to another. They name the object located and use a deictic term, such as here or [...] "there" [...] for location, or they name both the object located and its location. They can also use a general purpose locative marker, which is a preposition, postposition or suffix depending on the language that is linked in some way to the word for location. Children's earliest words for actions usually encode both the action and its result. Children use a small number of general purpose verbs, such as [...] "do" [...] and [...] "make" [...] for a large variety of actions because their resources are limited. Children acquiring a second language seem to use the same production strategies for talking about actions. Sometimes children use a highly specific verb instead of a general purpose verb. In both cases children stretch their resources to communicate what they want to say.|$|E

He felt that the solid plot and the unambiguous storytelling of The Immortals of Meluha was missing in The Secret of the Nagas, whose ending failed to live up the curiosity. Pal particularly criticized Tripathi's language, saying [...] "It seems that while writing The Secret of the Nagas, much of Amish’s attention was upon language. There are obvious and woefully inept attempts at literary flair that make the novel a tiresome read. The book suffers from a rash of exclamation marks and unnecessary italics. Sentences have been sliced to create weak, dangling fragments ('Parashuram charged. Followed by his vicious horde'). Instead of simply talking, people bellow, scream, whisper and fall silent. They are flabbergasted, they pirouette {{in the middle of a}} fight, and <b>use</b> <b>words</b> like 'exponentially', 'gargantuan' and 'plethora' in their speech. The net result is text that is labored, trite and awkward." [...] Kishwar Desai from Asian Age felt that in The Secret of the Nagas, the characterization of Shiva lost some of the fervor in it from the first book, and is cast more as a Bollywood hero, comparable to the likes of actor Salman Khan. Desai also noticed that there were too many characters in the book, most of them remaining unexplored. Likening the book with a computer game, the reviewer concluded that [...] "one of the remarkable qualities of [...] is that it is a very visual tale and less like a literary exercise." [...] Some critics like Sandipan Deb of Outlook though favored the visual style more and felt that Tripathi stayed true to the fantasy genre.|$|E
