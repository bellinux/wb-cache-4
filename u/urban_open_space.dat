40|$|Design {{plays an}} {{important}} role in facilitating (or inhibiting) the performance of social activities in <b>urban</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces.</b> Although recent literature has acknowledged that visual and non-visual sensory aspects should be taken into account in the design of environments, most theory, practice and teaching of urban design have focused on the visual qualities of spaces. Furthermore, design processes have often been based on the practitioners own intuitions and preferences instead of knowledge of how people interact with <b>urban</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces.</b> The present research demonstrates that an approach to the multisensory design of <b>urban</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> responsive to user needs and preferences is feasible and holds the promise of guiding best practice in the creation of high-quality g 9 thering <b>urban</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces.</b> Using structured interviews, unstructured observation, behavioural mapping techniques, sketch maps and an innovative sensory-behavioural mapping technique, this research identifies fundamental urban design elements and qualities to inform a responsive multisensory approach to design. The methodology proposed is hoped to motivate practitioners to apply environment behaviour knowledge throughout the process of multisensory urban design in different cultural contexts. Further, the urban design elements (props, boundaries, landmarks, spaces, atmospheres, views, anchors and repellents) that emerged from the present study as supportive of social activities in <b>urban</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> are applicable to the design of most gathering <b>urban</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> while robustness, richness and legibility are identified as key urban design qualities in attracting and retaining people in these spaces due to their responsiveness to various user needs and preferences.

However, <b>urban</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> in tropical climate are highly exposed to solar radiation. These conditions will lead to increased global warming and urban heat island. Therefore, vegetation (trees) in urban areas is of special value as they can reduce the air temperature by direct shading of surface as well as by moderating solar heat gain through evapotranspiration of the trees. This study compares the effectiveness and influences of vegetation density (High, Medium and Low Density) on microclimate modification in improving ambient and human thermal comfort in <b>urban</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces.</b> The study employed three (3) methods: (i) plant species selection procedure, (ii) a field measurement procedure and (iii) computer-based microclimate analysis (Temperature, Surface temperature and Relative humidity).

High vegetation density of Peltophorum pterocarpum (Yellow Flame) species of 100 meter² capability contributes to the reduction of the air temperature of up to 3. 1 °C by promoting more evapotranspiration and effectively improving the ambience and outdoor thermal comfort in tropical <b>urban</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces...</b>|$|R

The availability of attractive <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> is an essential feature of a liveable urban environment, for the inhabitants of cities and urban areas. Such importance is sometimes oversimplified when making decisions about land-use or discussing the qualities of the built form. As a city characterized by rapid development, <b>urban</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> in Doha are scattered around from its peripheries to its centre.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} public and academic interest in the environmental qualities of <b>urban</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces.</b> The study in this thesis focuses on soundscape research in <b>urban</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces,</b> which is within the paradigm of environmental psychology. It explores {{how to use the}} results of soundscape research in aiding the design process of <b>urban</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> with regard to the sonic environment. It is based on common notions that the acoustic aspect of <b>urban</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> should be considered {{in the same way as}} the visual dimensions. The determinant of a soundscape is subjective evaluations, which depend on two acoustic aspects; one is the sound nois~ scales and the other is the effects of various. sound sources. Based on data collected from a series of field studies and laboratory experiments, the subjective evaluations of sound-level and sound preference have been separately studied using statistical analyses, and the overall evaluations of sounds cape and acoustic comfort have been examined. In 9 rder to provide a feasible tool to aid soundscape deigns, the study develops a modelling tool, namely artificial neural network (ANN), to present the subjective evaluations of potential users at the design stage. Based on the ANN models, soundscape maps can be produced. The results of statistical analyses suggest that various factors influencing the subjective evaluations of sound level, sound preference and acoustic comfort are different in terms of a variation among case study sites and noticed sounds. Generally speaking, sound physical and psychological characteristics have the most influence on the subjective evaluations. The subjective evaluations of other physical environments are also much relevant to the soundscape evaluations, whereas socialldemographical and behavioural factors are insignificant although some relationships have been found for certain factors. In addition to giving useful guidelines and information to soundscape research and design, the results are also crucial in selecting input variables for ANN prediction models. For ANN model predictions, it is found that a general model for all the case study sites is less feasible due to the complex physical and social environments. Practical models for certain type of <b>urban</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> are more reliable. The performance of acoustic comfort models is considerably better than that of sound level models. It is also found that the key variables to determine the prediction performance of sound preference models are sound meanings and the sounds' physical and psychological characteristics. Furthermore, the prediction maps based on ANN models' outputsú have been successfully produced in presenting the potential users' appraisals of a soundscape in developing <b>urban</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
