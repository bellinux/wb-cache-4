40|$|This {{paper is}} one of three {{companion}} papers presenting the results of our in-depth analysis of the interstellar neutral helium (ISN He) observations carried out using the IBEX-Lo during the first six Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) observation seasons. We derive corrections for losses due to the limited throughput of the interface buffer and determine the IBEX spin-axis pointing. We develop an <b>uncertainty</b> <b>system</b> for the data, taking into account the resulting correlations between the data points. This system includes uncertainties due to Poisson statistics, background, spin-axis determination, systematic deviation of the boresight from the prescribed position, correction for the interface buffer losses, and the expected Warm Breeze (WB) signal. Subsequently, we analyze the data from 2009 to examine the role of various components of the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>system.</b> We show that the ISN He flow parameters are in good agreement with the values obtained by the original analysis. We identify the WB as the principal contributor to the global χ^ 2 values in previous analyses. Other uncertainties have a much milder role and their contributions are comparable to each other. The application of this <b>uncertainty</b> <b>system</b> reduced the minimum χ^ 2 value 4 -fold. The obtained χ^ 2 value, still exceeding the expected value, suggests that either the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>system</b> may still be incomplete or the adopted physical model lacks a potentially important element, which is likely an imperfect determination of the WB parameters. The derived corrections and <b>uncertainty</b> <b>system</b> are used in the accompanying paper by Bzowski et al. in an analysis of the data from six seasons. Comment: 43 pages, 9 figure...|$|E

Its breadth and powerfulness has been shown by the tremendous work achieved in broad areas. Recently, researchers have become more and more interested in modeling and controlling the performance of agents in an <b>uncertainty</b> <b>system</b> with such language. In this paper, we focus on the problems that the autonomous agent performs similar strategies repeatedly under same local situations in some <b>uncertainty</b> <b>system.</b> We introduce a special concept of action — macro-action — into the situation calculus, extend basic action theories and regression operators, and develop a knowledge base for the macro-actions so that the agent can remember certain information of them and later “recall” it when the agent performs the macro-actions in the same local situation again, therefore achieving the goal of saving computational time...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the stability problem of uncertain linear neutral systems using a discretized Lyapunov functional approach. The uncertainty under consideration is linear fractional norm-bounded uncertainty which includes the routine norm-bounded uncertainty as a special case. A delay-dependent stability criterion is derived and is formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The criterion can be used to check the stability of linear neutral systems with both small and non-small delays. For nominal systems, the analytical results can be approached with fine discretization. For <b>uncertainty</b> <b>systems</b> with small delay, numerical examples show significant improvement over approaches in the literature. For <b>uncertainty</b> <b>systems</b> with non-small delay, the effect of the uncertainty on the maximum time-delay interval for asymptotic stability is also studied...|$|R

The model assumes linear demand functions, quadratic generation cost functions and a lossless DC network, resulting in equilibrium constraints as a parametric linear complementarity problem (LCP). We introduce an iterative procedure for solving this EPEC through repeated application of an MPEC algorithm. This MPEC algorithm is based on solving quadratic programming sub-problems and on parametric LCP pivoting. Numerical examples demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} MPEC and EPEC algorithms and the tractability of the model for realistic size power systems. ...|$|E

40|$|Refer to this paper, an intelligent-fuzzy {{feed-forward}} computed torque estimator for Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller {{is proposed}} for highly nonlinear continuum robot manipulator. In {{the absence of}} robot knowledge, PID {{may be the best}} controller, because it is model-free, and its parameters can be adjusted easily and separately and it is the most used in robot manipulators. In order to remove steady-state error caused by uncertainties and noise, the integrator gain has to be increased. This leads to worse transient performance, even destroys the stability. The integrator in a PID controller also reduces the bandwidth of the closed-loop system. Model-based compensation for PD control is an alternative method to substitute PID control. Computed torque compensation is one of the nonlinear compensator. The main problem of the pure computed torque compensator (CTC) was highly nonlinear dynamic parameters which related to system’s dynamic parameters in certain and uncertain systems. The nonlinear equivalent dynamic problem in uncertain system is solved by using feed-forward fuzzy inference system. To eliminate the continuum robot manipulator system’s dynamic; Mamdani fuzzy inference system is design and applied to CTC.
