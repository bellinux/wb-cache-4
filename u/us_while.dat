5|$|The {{trade in}} New England ice {{expanded}} during the 1830s and 1840s across the eastern {{coast of the}} <b>U.S.,</b> <b>while</b> new trade routes were created across the world. The first and most profitable of these new routes was to India: in 1833 Tudor combined with the businessmen Samuel Austin and William Rogers to attempt to export ice to Calcutta using the brigantine ship the Tuscany. The Anglo-Indian elite, concerned {{about the effects of}} the summer heat, quickly agreed to exempt the imports from the usual East India Company regulations and trade tariffs, and the initial net shipment of around a hundred tons (90,000kg) sold successfully. With the ice fetching for three pence (£0.80 in 2010 terms) per pound (0.5kg), the first shipment aboard the Tuscany produced profits of $9,900 ($253,000), and in 1835 Tudor commenced regular exports to Calcutta, Madras and Bombay.|$|E
5|$|Bon Jovi's third album, Slippery When Wet (1986), mixed {{hard rock}} with a pop {{sensitivity}} {{and spent a}} total of 8 weeks {{at the top of}} the Billboard 200 album chart, selling 12 million copies in the <b>US</b> <b>while</b> becoming the first hard rock album to spawn three top 10 singles — two of which reached number one. The album has been credited with widening the audiences for the genre, particularly by appealing to women as well as the traditional male dominated audience, and opening the door to MTV and commercial success for other bands at the end of the decade. The anthemic The Final Countdown (1986) by Swedish group Europe was an international hit, reaching number eight on the US charts while hitting the top 10 in nine other countries. This era also saw more glam-infused American hard rock bands come to the forefront, with both Poison and Cinderella releasing their multi-platinum début albums in 1986. Van Halen released 5150 (1986), their first album with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals, which was number one in the US for three weeks and sold over 6 million copies. By the second half of the decade, hard rock had become the most reliable form of commercial popular music in the United States.|$|E
