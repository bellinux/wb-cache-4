50|$|A googol is {{the large}} number 10100. In <b>decimal</b> <b>notation,</b> it is written as the digit 1 {{followed}} by one hundred zeroes: 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.|$|R

50|$|A googolplex is {{the number}} 10, or equivalently, 10. Written out in {{ordinary}} <b>decimal</b> <b>notation,</b> it is 1 followed by 10100 zeroes, that is, a 1 followed by a googol of zeroes.|$|R
25|$|A {{tallying}} {{system has}} {{no concept of}} place value (as in modern <b>decimal</b> <b>notation),</b> which limits its representation of large numbers. Nonetheless tallying systems are considered the first kind of abstract numeral system.|$|R

5|$|Hexadecimal is a base-16 {{numeral system}} {{used in the}} fields of {{computer}} programming and mathematics. The key is an ordinary number most widely known by its hexadecimal representation; in <b>decimal</b> <b>notation,</b> it is 13,256,278,887,989,457,651,018,865,901,401,704,640.|$|R
50|$|Napier made further contributions. He {{improved}} Simon Stevin's <b>decimal</b> <b>notation.</b> Lattice multiplication, used by Fibonacci, {{was made}} more convenient by his introduction of Napier's bones, a multiplication tool using {{a set of}} numbered rods.|$|R
50|$|Since 10,000 + (−2,000) + 200 + (−40) + 3 = 8,163, the {{representation}} 12,243 in negadecimal notation {{is equivalent to}} 8,163 in <b>decimal</b> <b>notation,</b> while −8,163 in decimal would be written 9,977 in negadecimal.|$|R
5000|$|Sentti is {{problematic}} in that its primary meaning in colloquial language is [...] "centimeter". Thus, the officially recommended abbreviation of sentti is snt, although Finnish merchants generally use a <b>decimal</b> <b>notation</b> (for example 0,35 €).|$|R
40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 2004 Dr. Vicki SteinleThis thesis reports on a longitudinal study of students’ understanding of <b>decimal</b> <b>notation.</b> Over 3000 students, from a volunteer sample of 12 schools in Victoria, Australia, completed nearly 10000 tests over a 4 -year period. The number of tests completed by individual students varied from 1 to 7 and the average inter-test time was 8 months. The diagnostic test used in this study, (Decimal Comparison Test), was created by extending and refining tests in the literature to identify students with one of 12 misconceptions about <b>decimal</b> <b>notation.</b> (For complete abstract open document) Open Acces...|$|R

5000|$|Non-standard {{numbers are}} elusive: {{each one is}} too {{enormous}} to be manageable in <b>decimal</b> <b>notation</b> or any other representation, explicit or implicit, no matter how ingenious your notation.

5000|$|In modern {{studies of}} ancient {{mathematics}} and astronomy it is customary to write sexagesimal numbers with each sexagesimal digit represented in standard <b>decimal</b> <b>notation</b> {{as a number}} from 0 to 59, and with each digit separated by a comma. When appropriate, the fractional part of the sexagesimal number is separated from the whole number part by a semicolon rather than a comma, although in many cases this distinction may {{not appear in the}} original historical document and must be taken as an interpretation of the text. [...] Using this notation the square root of two, which in <b>decimal</b> <b>notation</b> appears as 1.41421... appears in modern sexagesimal notation as 1;24,51,10.... This notation is used in this article.|$|R
50|$|With four bits, it is {{possible}} to create 16 different values. All single digit hexadecimal numbers can be written with four bits. Binary-coded decimal is a digital encoding method for numbers using <b>decimal</b> <b>notation,</b> with each <b>decimal</b> digit represented by four bits.|$|R
50|$|For real numbers {{written in}} <b>decimal</b> <b>notation,</b> a {{slightly}} different variant of the lexicographical order is used: the parts on {{the left of the}} decimal point are compared as before; if they are equal, the parts at the right of the decimal point are compared with the lexicographical order.|$|R
40|$|Historically, the {{notational}} {{system of}} the Dewey Decimal Classification provided for non-institution-specific, relative location shelf arrangements, thus substantially reducing bibliographic classification effort.
