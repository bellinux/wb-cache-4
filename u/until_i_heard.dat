5|$|One {{person could}} say that 'hero' is a schmaltzy piece of garbage, but another person can write to me a letter and say, 'I've {{considered}} committing suicide everyday of my life {{for the last ten}} years <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> that song and I realized after all I can be my own hero.' And that, that's an unexplainable feeling, like I've done something with my life, y'know?... It meant something to someone.|$|E
500|$|The band's {{earliest}} influences include Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Little Richard and Chuck Berry. During the Beatles' co-residency with Little Richard at the Star-Club in Hamburg, from April to May 1962, {{he advised}} {{them on the}} proper technique for performing his songs. Of Presley, Lennon said, [...] "Nothing really affected me <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> Elvis. If there hadn't been Elvis, there {{would not have been}} the Beatles." ...|$|E
500|$|Newman, a {{professional}} artist from Minneapolis, {{responded to the}} curators' cogitation by describing how the image came into being. She bought used canvases while a poor art student, and was unsure {{how to use a}} canvas with these dimensions. Inspired by a cartoon of a dachshund, she chose that as a subject, but was unhappy with the effect until she added a hula skirt she had seen in a magazine, and colored dog bones she spied in a pet store. Newman wrote to them, saying [...] "I almost threw it out <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> of MOBA. After many years of slashing rejected work, now I wish I had saved them all for you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Gentlemen,' said Darsie, with a {{throbbing}} bosom, for he {{felt the}} crisis a very painful one, 'Allow me to say, that I suspend expressing my sentiments on the important subject under discussion <b>until</b> <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> those of the present meeting.' ...|$|R
6000|$|I am {{not certain}} that any {{external}} cause aroused me from my slumbers. But I well remember that I lay there on my straw, meditating for some time, half asleep and half awake, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> fancied <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> the musical voice of Dus, murmuring in my ear my own name. This illusion lasted some little time; when, as my faculties gradually resumed their powers, I became slowly convinced that some one was actually calling me, and by name too, within {{a foot or two}} of my ears. I could not be mistaken; the fact was so, and the call was in a woman's tones. Springing up, I demanded-- ...|$|R
500|$|One notable {{advocate}} for the fledgling movement was Mark Twain. Manipulative treatments had purportedly alleviated the symptoms of his daughter Jean's epilepsy as well as Twain's own chronic bronchitis. In 1909, he spoke before the New York State Assembly at a hearing regarding the practice of osteopathy in the state. [...] "I don't know as I cared much about these osteopaths <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> {{you were going to}} drive them out of the state, but since I heard that I haven't been able to sleep." [...] Philosophically opposed to the American Medical Association's stance that its own type of medical practice was the only legitimate one, he spoke in favor of licensing for osteopaths. Physicians from the New York County Medical Society responded with a vigorous attack on Twain, who retorted with [...] "he physicians think they are moved by regard for {{the best interests of the}} public. Isn't there a little touch of self-interest back of it all?" [...] "...The objection is, people are curing people without a license and you are afraid it will bust up business." ...|$|E
500|$|Presley's rise to {{national}} attention in 1956 transformed {{the field of}} popular music and had a huge effect on the broader scope of popular culture. As the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll, he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude. With its racially mixed origins—repeatedly affirmed by Presley—rock and roll's occupation of a central position in mainstream American culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture. In this regard, Little Richard said of Presley, [...] "He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He {{opened the door for}} black music." [...] Al Green agreed: [...] "He broke the ice for all of us." [...] President Jimmy Carter remarked on his legacy in 1977: [...] "His music and his personality, fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues, permanently changed the face of American popular culture. His following was immense, and he was a symbol to people the world over of the vitality, rebelliousness, and good humor of his country." [...] Presley also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication: at the age of 21, within a year of his first appearance on American network television, {{he was one of the}} most famous people in the world. John Lennon stated that [...] "Before Elvis there was nothing." [...] Lennon also said that [...] "Nothing really affected me <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> Elvis. If there hadn't been an Elvis, there wouldn't have been the Beatles." ...|$|E
2500|$|On a 2003 trip to Israel, DeLay {{toured the}} nation and {{addressed}} members of the Knesset. His opposition to land concessions {{is so strong that}} Aryeh Eldad, the deputy of Israel's conservative National Union party, remarked, [...] "As I shook his hand, I told Tom DeLay that <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> him speak, I thought I was farthest to the right in the Knesset." [...] Former Mossad chief Danny Yatom said [...] "The Likud is nothing compared to this guy." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} wrong, George," [...] Andrew said. [...] "The voices of women vary like the thumb-marks of criminals. There are no two attuned exactly alike. It is the {{receptive}} organs {{that are at}} fault. We, who have lost one sense, find the others a little keener. The laughter of that girl--George, will you keep me a few days longer? Somehow I cannot bring myself to leave <b>until</b> <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> her voice once more." ...|$|R
60|$|Again I did {{not return}} to Nelson Square until the early hours, and the next morning did not venture out <b>until</b> <b>I</b> had <b>heard</b> Miss Sellars, who {{appeared}} to be in a bad temper, leave the house. Then running {{to the top of the}} kitchen stairs, I called for Mrs. Peedles. I told her I was going to leave her, and, judging the truth to be the simplest explanation, I told her the reason why.|$|R
2500|$|Several notable {{artists and}} musicians cite Milo Goes to College as a {{favorite}} and influence, including Mike Watt of the Minutemen, David Nolte of The Last, and Zach Blair of Hagfish, Only Crime, and Rise Against. Dave Grohl of Nirvana and the Foo Fighters opined that [...] "If the Descendents had made Milo Goes to College in 1999, they’d {{be living in}} fucking mansions. That’s a fucking amazing record." [...] Joey Cape of Lagwagon remarked that the album [...] "was just huge in punk and to me. I don’t think {{there would have been}} a [...] song like 'Angry Days' without that album." [...] Fat Mike of NOFX has cited Milo Goes to College as his favorite record of all time, and said that hearing the song [...] "Kabuki Girl" [...] on Rodney Bingenheimer's Rodney on the ROQ program on KROQ-FM was a significant moment in his youth. Chris Shary, who has done artwork for the Descendents and their successor band, All, since 1998, remarked that [...] "From the minute that I heard the beginning it was like 'this is the music that I have been waiting for. Photographer Glen E. Friedman, who photographed the band during the early 1980s, recalled that [...] "the album had just come out, and coincidentally I had my own little heartbreak as a teenager, and I heard that song 'Hope' and I gotta say that I had never in my life related to a song about love ever before <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> that song [...] I was just 'Wow, this is fucking heavy. This guy's hurting even more than I am, and this is desperation.' A whole new world opened up of a depth of emotion in music for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Frames has {{received}} positive reviews. Luke Bryan of the Chicago Sun-Times extolled the album, suggesting {{that those who}} had previously been detractors of DeWyze {{would have to take}} notice as [...] "gorgeous lyrics tell one soulful story after another." [...] Jeff Dodge of BuddyTV concurred that the album was likely to win over new fans and wrote, [...] "It doesn't have the safe pop-y sounds of his debut; he's now with a record label that supports his musical efforts and he's able to showcase who he is as an artist." [...] People Magazine gave the album three stars out of four and called it [...] "a strong folk-pop effort." [...] Gerry Galipault of The Sarasota Herald-Tribune gave the album a B+, writing that DeWyze is [...] "more confident, lyrically and vocally." [...] In her review for the Daily Reporter, Kate Padilla noted a maturity in DeWyze's voice that she did not feel had been present in his previous recordings. While specifically mentioning [...] "Like I Do", [...] "Frames", and [...] "Silver Lining" [...] as some of the album's standout tracks, she also wrote that she had already listened to the album as a whole [...] "Too many times to count" [...] since it had been released a week earlier. Lamenting the album's low debut on the Billboard Album 200 Chart, Mark Franklin of The York Dispatchs blog, Idol Chatter, wrote that [...] "three of the first four songs on Frames are probably better than anything on [...] Live It Up". Joseph Brownell of David Atlanta wrote that the album contains [...] "DeWyze's most personal tracks to date" [...] and lives up to the expectations that his previous album had failed to meet, while freelance music journalist Kevin Oliver wrote on his blog that Frames [...] "may just be the most surprisingly good album ever from a past [...] winner". [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album three stars out of five, feeling that DeWyze had drawn inspiration from Mumford & Sons and The Lumineers to reinvent himself on many of the tracks. He wrote that DeWyze [...] "eagerly throws himself into the fray, roaring these songs like a true believer", but felt that the album's highlights were actually the pop songs [...] "You Don't Know Me" [...] and [...] "The Ride". In a review for Broken Records Magazine, Cindy Athanaseas called the album [...] "a brilliant piece of work" [...] by [...] "an artist whose music needs to be heard." [...] She praised DeWyze's voice, which she noted ranges from [...] "soft & tender" [...] to [...] "rough & sultry" [...] and wrote, [...] "Each song tells an individual story, but the collection of songs paints a beautiful picture of life’s highs and lows...As I listened to the album, each song became my favorite … <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> the next one." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{business}} is very dangerous, {{and of its}} end I will not speak <b>until</b> <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> the counsel of your great-uncle, the holy Tanofir. Still, things having gone so far, {{it seems to me}} that boldness may be the best course, since the great King has his Grecian wars to deal with, and whatever he may say, cannot attack Egypt yet awhile. Therefore if Peroa is able to overcome Idernes and his army he may cause himself to be proclaimed Pharaoh and make Egypt free if only for a time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] replied Annerly, [...] "is {{a matter}} that has shown the same {{singularity}} {{as the rest of}} my experience. It is now four years since Q and his wife went to Australia. At first <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> from him quite regularly, and received two letters each month. Presently I only received one letter every two months, and later two letters every six months, and then only one letter every twelve months. Then <b>until</b> last night <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> nothing whatever of Q {{for a year and a}} half." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My cousin told me {{that when}} he {{returned}} he should have something particular to say to me, and that we could do nothing or decide nothing <b>until</b> <b>I</b> should have <b>heard</b> it. But <b>I</b> will make him tell me quickly, and then we will go to the ancient fortress. There is no hurry to get to Paris; there is plenty of time." ...|$|R

60|$|How the {{interval}} of suspense in which I was now condemned might have affected {{other men in}} my position, I cannot pretend to say. The influence of the two hours' probation upon my temperament was simply this. I felt physically incapable of remaining still in any one place, and morally incapable of speaking to any one human being, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> had first <b>heard</b> all that Ezra Jennings had to say to me.|$|R
60|$|Then I {{turned and}} ran, or rather waddled, for in that gear I could not run, {{out of the}} chamber until the rock wall beyond stayed me, and there, with my back towards her, thrust my helmeted head against it, for I felt as though red-hot bradawls had been plunged into my eyes. So I stood while she laughed and mocked behind me <b>until</b> at length <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> the door close and the blessed {{darkness}} came like a gift from Heaven.|$|R

I really do not like to go {{anywhere}} <b>until</b> <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> from Montfort. <b>I</b> think I shall go to my hotel' 'I will drive you. It is now three o'clock.' But just at this moment, Mr. Bevil called on the Count, and another hour disappeared. When they were fairly in the cabriolet, there were so many places to call at, and so many persons to see, that it was nearly six o'clock when they reached the hotel. Ferdinand ran up stairs to see if there were any letter from Lord Montfort. He found his lordship's card, and also Mr. Temple's; they had called about half an hour ago; there was also a note. These were its contents:-- ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Thus I remained, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> my dogs snarling, and a man's voice. What do {{you think}} the voice said? I will tell you. It said: 'Where in hell did you come from??' ...|$|E
60|$|As to our nightly life, the {{contagion}} {{of suspicion}} and fear was among us, {{and there is}} no such contagion under the sky. Hooded woman? According to the accounts, we were in a perfect Convent of hooded women. Noises? With that contagion downstairs, I myself have sat in the dismal parlour, listening, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> so many and such strange noises, that they would have chilled my blood if I had not warmed it by dashing out to make discoveries.

He is on board to get ahead of you some way or other--perhaps get up a mutiny and go to the pole himself. He is the wickedest-looking man I ever saw, and he scared me when I first {{recognized}} him.

60|$|For a {{good while}} <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> nothing further of Catriona--my Miss Grant {{remaining}} quite impenetrable, and stopping my mouth with pleasantries. At last, {{one day that}} she returned from walking, and found me alone in the parlour over my French, I thought there was something unusual in her looks; the colour heightened, the eyes sparkling high, {{and a bit of}} a smile continually bitten in as she regarded me. She seemed indeed like the very spirit of mischief, and, walking briskly in the room, had soon involved me in a kind of quarrel over nothing and (at the least) with nothing intended on my side. I was like Christian in the slough--the more I tried to clamber out upon the side, the deeper <b>I</b> became involved; <b>until</b> at last <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> her declare, {{with a great deal of}} passion, that she would take that answer at the hands of none, and I must down upon my knees for pardon.|$|R
