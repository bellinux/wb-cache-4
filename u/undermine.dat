We further theorize that moral identity {{functions as a}} boundary condition: high moral identity attenuates whether interpersonal injustice and resource depletion shape moral disengagement and whether moral disengagement translates to subsequent <b>undermining.</b> A field study of bank employees provides empirical support for the mediating mechanisms, and shows that employees who have high moral identity {{are less likely to}} respond to interpersonal injustice by morally disengaging and to translate moral disengagement to <b>undermining...</b>|$|R

Couples in which fathers were higher on negative affect or higher on positive affect displayed more <b>undermining</b> coparenting.

40|$|A {{sample of}} 171 {{participants}} (94 unemployed and 77 underemployed) was administered scales tapping social support, social <b>undermining,</b> coping and psychological distress. It was hypothesised (a) that the unemployed would exhibit less social support, but more social <b>undermining</b> and psychological distress than the underemployed group; (b) that females would report more social support but less social <b>undermining</b> than males; and (c) that social support {{would be a}} better predictor of coping than social <b>undermining,</b> but that social <b>undermining</b> {{would be a better}} predictor of psychological distress than social support. It was found that the unemployed reported less social support, more psychological distress and less problem-focused coping than the underemployed. Males reported less social support but more emotion-focused coping than females. Social support was a significant individual predictor for both psychological distress and rational/cognitive coping, but not of self-care coping.

50|$|Another {{example of}} how social <b>undermining</b> can affect a person's {{relationship}} is shown by {{a study conducted by}} McCaskill and Lakey which examined social support and social <b>undermining</b> when it came to adolescents and family relationships. Social support and social <b>undermining</b> can reflect different characteristics in the environment that can influence a person's mental health. The study examined how adolescents reported their family support and <b>undermining</b> which reflected shared social reality (that is, all members of the family agree that support or <b>undermining</b> is occurring) and idiosyncratic perception (some family members believe that support or <b>undermining</b> has occurred, but others do not). The results of the study found that girls tend to report higher family stress and negative affect than boys. McCaskill and Lakey (2002) found that adolescents with previous outpatient treatment experience reported both lower family support and higher family stress.|$|R
50|$|Social <b>undermining</b> {{and social}} support can have {{opposite}} effects on a person that can be negative or positive depending on the person or even the relationship. Being in a close relationship can provide a person both social <b>undermining</b> {{and social support}}. Example of these relationships can be an abusive relationship that offers low support and high <b>undermining.</b> A typical healthy close relationship has high support and low <b>undermining.</b> In a relationship between an adolescent and a parent, their relationship can offer high levels of support and even <b>undermining.</b> Depending on the relationship, patterns can change over time based on the characteristics and {{the situation of the}} relationship.

The study looked at the effect of financial strain, social support, and <b>undermining</b> on poor mental health the results found that it was not statistically significant. Social support and social <b>undermining</b> did have significant but the opposite effect on poor mental health.

50|$|Market, Stanforth, and Garcia {{found that}} social <b>undermining</b> used by family members, friends and {{coworkers}} can affect daily activities. Social <b>undermining</b> can affect exercise routines when their exercise routines can conflict with seeing friends or even coworkers. Friends and coworkers {{can influence the}} person to skip their exercise, even when a spouse is concerned about their well being. The study also showed that social <b>undermining</b> can affect men and women differently. Men tend {{to feel as if}} they can overcome social <b>undermining</b> because they were still able to make a healthy eating decision. Women have stated that they tend to make bad eating decision when they are eating with other people such as their friends. Social <b>undermining</b> pressures can cause serious challenges when a person is trying to maintain healthy eating and trying to stay active. The study found that people that engage in <b>undermining</b> behavior tend to feel guilty about their own unhealthy behavior and may feel jealous of someone else maintaining their healthy behavior when they cannot achieve the same behavior. The study also suggests when a person is satisfied with their weight it can help the person resist against social <b>undermining.</b> By being satisfied with one's own weight can reduce the likelihood of social <b>undermining</b> in social situations when having dinner with friends. So when a person is not satisfied with their weight they receive more social <b>undermining</b> pressures from the people around them.|$|R

Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson was the founder of the Jeffersonian Republicans, and he strenuously opposed Hamilton's agenda. Washington typically favored Hamilton over Jefferson, and it was Hamilton's agenda that went into effect.

5|$|Al-Misri was {{recalled}} to Istanbul in {{the summer}} of 1774 and Muhammad Pasha al-Azm was appointed governor of Damascus. Thus, Zahir's governorship of Sidon was left vulnerable because it had largely depended on guarantees from al-Misri. Al-Azm sought peaceful relations with Zahir, but the Sublime Porte, having made peace with Russia and relieving itself from that conflict, aimed to <b>undermine</b> the rebellious rulers of its provinces, including Zahir. Al-Azm managed to secure an official pardon of Zahir from the Porte in April 1775, but not the governorship of Sidon. Meanwhile, conflict between Zahir and his sons had reignited, with Ali of Safad attempting to capture Zahir's villages in Galilee in 1774. Zahir defeated Ali with support from his other son, Ahmad of Tiberias. Afterward, Zahir's rule was again challenged by one of his other sons, Sa'id, later that year. In response to this challenge, Zahir armed and mobilized 300 of Acre's civilian inhabitants to counter Sa'id.

Ill. (some tables) In organizations, social networks (e. g., friendship and communication) not only facilitate individual communication in an organizational landscape but also are salient arenas where individuals influence one another when they determine work-related attitudes and behaviors. In this thesis, I argue that organizational friendship and communication networks can function in unwanted ways that foster (rather than inhibit) social influence among organizational members {{to engage in}} social <b>undermining</b> behaviors. I integrate the network theory of social influence into extant work on social influence of <b>undermining</b> behaviors {{in the workplace and}} propose that (1) network peers influence individuals' social <b>undermining</b> such that level of network peer <b>undermining</b> is positively related to individual <b>undermining</b> and (2) contextual characteristics (behavioral and structural characteristics of social networks) and personality traits (self-monitoring and core self-evaluation) further condition the network peer influence. In addition, I articulate three network-based proximity influence mechanisms [...] direct contact, group cohesion, and structural equivalence [...] whereby network peers influence individuals' <b>undermining</b> behaviors. I did not find support for the relationship between level of network peer <b>undermining</b> and individual undermining; but the relationship is found to be contingent on the contextual characteristics and personality traits. I also found that the three influence mechanisms contribute to similarity on <b>undermining</b> among organizational members. I discuss the implications as well as limitations and future directions of this thesis...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has yielded mixed results regarding {{the effects of}} age on innovation-related behavior (IRB; i. e., generating, disseminating, and implementing new ideas). This paper hypothesizes that the relationship of age with IRB is jointly moderated by <b>undermining</b> behavior {{on the part of}} the supervisor and the extent to which the employee possesses a proactive personality. We collected data from 196 employees at three points in time over a one-year period. Results supported the hypothesized 3 -way interaction of age, supervisor <b>undermining,</b> and proactive personality on IRB. As predicted, highly proactive older workers responded to high supervisor <b>undermining</b> with more IRB, whereas older workers low on proactive personality responded to high supervisor <b>undermining</b> with less IRB. On the other hand, when supervisor <b>undermining</b> was low, proactive personality did not moderate the relationship of age with IRB. ¬© 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
