In an August 3, 2012 Olympic heat, Cabral finished 4th with a time of 8:21.46 in his 13-man heat, earning the last automatic berth to the August 5 finals. Cabral's time was 10th fastest of the 15 advancing runners (and of all 39 entrants), slower than all six qualifiers from heat 1 and faster than all 4 qualifiers from heat 2. In the finals, he led at the 1000 meter split with a time of 2:52.70, but he finished in eighth place with a time of 8:25.91.|$|E
5|$|Basketball player Becky Hammon was {{not being}} {{considered}} for the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Olympic</b> team but wanted to play in an Olympic Games, so she emigrated to Russia, where she already played in a domestic league during the WNBA offseason.

5|$|Ellis {{defeated}} Betterman 2 to 0 at {{the finals}} of the 2012 U.S. Olympic Trials. Coleman had attended Betterman's wrestling clinics {{when he was}} younger. Coleman is {{the youngest member of}} the American wrestling delegation going to the Olympics. After Coleman qualified for the Olympics, he realized that his mother, who works in customer service for the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority, could not afford to attend due to financial hardship. Coleman was living at the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Olympic</b> Training Center in Colorado Springs on a limited monthly stipend from the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Olympic</b> Committee and could not assist her. Powell rented Coleman's family a one-bedroom flat in London out of personal funds and the Oak Park High School wrestling program subsequently raised $14,000 to ensure that his mother, aunt and siblings could attend. Coleman dropped from the 66kg division to the 60kg division for the Olympics. Coleman lost {{in the first round of}} Olympic competition to Ivo Angelov of Bulgaria by a 31 score.|$|E

5|$|As {{with almost}} every event that he entered {{in at the}} 2008 Summer Olympics, Michael Phelps was the {{favorite}} to win the men's 100 metre butterfly. Since winning the {{gold medal at the}} previous Games, in Athens, Phelps had demonstrated his superiority in this event, by also becoming world champion at the Melbourne 2007 World Championships, and achieving victory at the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Olympic</b> Trials. Therefore, the 100 metre butterfly was one of the eight Olympic events where Phelps was attempting to win a gold medal.|$|E

5|$|A {{campaign}} {{to send an}} American side to the 1920 games in Antwerp started in California after a Berkeley rugby union touring party returned from British Columbia undefeated in 1920. The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Olympic</b> Committee (USOC) granted permission for entry. A pool of players from Stanford, Berkeley, and Santa Clara made up the squad. 1908 champion Danny Carroll, a player-coach at Stanford at the time, was the team's most prominent member. When the U.S. arrived in Antwerp, the Czechoslovakian and Romanian teams had withdrawn, leaving only France and the United States. The English RFU {{had decided not to}} enter a team, so as not to interfere with the start of the English domestic season.|$|E

5|$|Initially, five American cities vied for the 2016 Olympics: Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. The USOC's {{chairman}} at the time, Peter Ueberroth, visited {{all potential}} host cities during April and May 2006. He visited Chicago on May 10. On July 26, 2006, the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Olympic</b> Committee (USOC) narrowed {{its list of}} American applicant cities to three: Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. San Francisco withdrew its application on November 13, 2006 after the San Francisco 49ers pulled out of a deal {{for the construction of}} a new stadium that would be the centerpiece of the games.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, Plumb {{was named}} {{as one of}} the 50 most {{influential}} horsemen of the 20th century by the equine magazine Chronicle of the Horse. In 2003, Plumb was inducted to the United States Eventing Association Hall of Fame, along with one of his horses, Plain Sailing. Good Mixture, another of Plumb's horses, was inducted in 2009. In 2008, Plumb became the first (and to date, only) equestrian to be inducted into the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Olympic</b> Hall of Fame. The United States Eventing Association awarded Plumb their Leading Rider of the Year Award on ten occasions. Plumb is known for his training abilities with both horses and other riders, and as of 2008 he continued to ride and train at his stables in Southern Pines, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, Toronto {{initially}} {{planned to}} gain hosting rights for 2012 {{after losing the}} 2008 Olympics bidding process, but because Vancouver landed the 2010 Winter Olympics, the Canadian city cancelled these plans. In the United States, the city of New York was picked by the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Olympic</b> Committee (USOC) over San Francisco, although several other cities submitted candidatures to become the American candidate for the 2012 Olympics; these included Houston, Washington D.C. (in cooperation with nearby Baltimore), Cincinnati, Dallas, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Seattle and Tampa (in cooperation with nearby Orlando). Several European cities wanted to follow the likes of London, Madrid, Moscow and Paris, and were thus hopeful to gain their NOC's support. Germany chose Leipzig over Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, and Stuttgart, while in Spain, Seville lost out to Madrid. Other referenced cities were Budapest, Milan, Rome, Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö, Oslo and Copenhagen.|$|E
5|$|The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Olympic</b> Committee (USOC) {{selected}} Chicago over Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and San Francisco as its candidate city to {{host the}} 2016 Summer Olympics and 2016 Summer Paralympics on April 14, 2007. This is the city's third failure, after two failed attempts for the 1952 and the 1956 Summer Olympics (and fourth overall attempt, as Chicago won the 1904 Olympics, but they were moved to St Louis as the World's Fair was there and threatened to host a competing competition if the Olympics were not moved). Numerous Olympic Games in North America, including the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, hurt Chicago's bid. It {{would have been the}} ninth Olympics hosted in the United States, after the 1904, 1932, 1984 and 1996 Summer Olympics; and the 1932, 1960, 1980 and 2002 Winter Olympics.|$|E
