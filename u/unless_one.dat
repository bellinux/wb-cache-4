5|$|At {{least partly}} {{explaining}} why both Lamb and Hazlitt felt {{the inadequacy of}} Shakespearean stage performances was that the theatres themselves were huge and gaudy, audiences were noisy and unmannerly, and dramatic presentations {{in the early nineteenth}} century were sensationalistic, laden with artificial and showy props. In addition, <b>unless</b> <b>one</b> sat down in the pit, one could easily miss the subtleties of the actors' facial and vocal expressions.|$|E
5|$|Male crickets {{establish}} their dominance {{over each other}} by aggression. They start by lashing each other with their antennae and flaring their mandibles. <b>Unless</b> <b>one</b> retreats at this stage, they resort to grappling, {{at the same time}} each emitting calls that are quite unlike those uttered in other circumstances. When one achieves dominance, it sings loudly, while the loser remains silent.|$|E
5|$|SmarTrip cards {{comply with}} the ISO/IEC 14443 Type B standard. A {{microchip}} contained within the card stores its value, {{as well as the}} rider’s most recent entry and exit points, and a unique identifier. However, the unique identifier is not linked to a person’s name or identity, <b>unless</b> <b>one</b> registers the card online. Registering SmarTrip cards allows riders to recover their remaining balance (minus a $5 replacement fee), should the card be lost, stolen, or damaged. The unique identifier also allows workers enrolled in the SmartBenefits program, which allows employers to subsidize employee transportation costs tax-free, to credit their monthly benefits to their cards.|$|E

5|$|Females {{are ready}} to breed at ten to eleven months of age {{although}} males sometimes wait till the following year. Barn owls are usually monogamous, sticking to one partner for life <b>unless</b> <b>one</b> of the pair dies. During the non-breeding season they may roost separately, but as the breeding season approaches they return to their established nesting site, showing considerable site fidelity. In colder climates, in harsh weather and where winter food supplies may be scarce, they may roost in farm buildings and in barns between hay bales, but they then run the risk that their selected nesting hole may {{be taken over by}} some other, earlier-nesting species. Single males may establish feeding territories, patrolling the hunting areas, occasionally stopping to hover, and perching on lofty eminences where they screech to attract a mate. Where a female has lost her mate but maintained her breeding site, she usually seems to manage to attract a new spouse.|$|E
5|$|The {{barn owl}} is nocturnal {{over most of}} its range, but in Britain and some Pacific islands, it also hunts by day. Barn owls specialise in hunting animals {{on the ground and}} nearly all of their food {{consists}} of small mammals which they locate by sound, their hearing being very acute. They mate for life <b>unless</b> <b>one</b> of the pair gets killed, when a new pair bond may be formed. Breeding takes place at varying times of year according to locality, with a clutch, averaging about four eggs, being laid in a nest in a hollow tree, old building or fissure in a cliff. The female does all the incubation, and she and the young chicks are reliant on the male for food. When large numbers of small prey are readily available, barn owl populations can expand rapidly, and globally the bird is considered to be of least conservation concern. Some subspecies with restricted ranges are more threatened.|$|E

5000|$|Response {{from the}} gaming media was very positive. CRASH, a Spectrum gaming magazine, summed Tau Ceti up in 1985 as [...] "an {{excellent}} game, combining several elements with stunning graphics" [...] {{and gave it}} an overall rating of 94%. Another Spectrum magazine, Sinclair User, gave it a 5 star rating and declared [...] "It's {{hard to imagine a}} better space game, <b>unless</b> <b>one's</b> talking about Elite, with its intergalactic scope and strategic depth. Viewed as a shoot 'em up with a purpose to the carnage, Tau Ceti has {{to be one of the}} all-time greats." ...|$|R

25|$|The game {{received}} primarily negative reviews {{across all}} platforms, with many reviewers arguing the plot was incomprehensible <b>unless</b> <b>one</b> {{were familiar with}} the film and/or novel.

25|$|When used {{to detect}} whether a {{difference}} exists between groups, a paradox arises. As improvements are made to experimental design (e.g., increased precision of measurement and sample size), the test becomes more lenient. <b>Unless</b> <b>one</b> accepts the absurd assumption that all sources of noise in the data cancel out completely, the chance of finding statistical significance in either direction approaches 100%.|$|E

25|$|All {{of these}} {{writings}} analyze {{the concept of}} faith, on the supposition that if people are confused about faith, as Kierkegaard thought the inhabitants of Christendom were, {{they will not be}} in a position to develop the virtue.

50|$|Again {{and again}} he repeats the advice that nothing should be hazarded <b>unless</b> <b>one's</b> army is {{completely}} secure, a rule which he himself neglected with such brilliant results in 1796. Strategic points, he says, not {{the defeat of the}} enemy's army, decide the fate of one's own country, and must constantly remain the general's main concern, a maxim which was never more remarkably disproved than in the war of 1809. The editor of the archduke's work is able to make but a feeble defense against Clausewitz's reproach that Charles attached more value to ground than to the annihilation of the foe. In his tactical writings the same spirit is conspicuous. His reserve in battle is designed to cover a retreat.|$|R
