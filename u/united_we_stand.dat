25|$|Several {{months before}} the Democratic and Republican conventions, Perot filled the vacuum of {{election}} news, as his supporters began petition drives to {{get him on the}} ballot in all 50 states. This sense of momentum was reinforced when Perot employed two savvy campaign managers in Democrat Hamilton Jordan and Republican Ed Rollins. In July, while Perot was pondering whether to run for office, his supporters established a campaign organization <b>United</b> <b>We</b> <b>Stand</b> America. Perot was late in making formal policy proposals, but most of what he did call for were intended to reduce the deficit, such as a gasoline tax increase and cutbacks to Social Security.|$|E
500|$|By mid-July, the Washington Post {{reported}} that Perot's campaign managers were becoming increasingly disillusioned by his unwillingness {{to follow their}} advice {{to be more specific}} on issues, and his need to be in full control of operations with such tactics as forcing volunteers to sign loyalty oaths. Perot's poll numbers began to slip to 25%, and his advisers warned that if he continued to ignore them, he would fall into single digits. Co-manager Hamilton Jordan threatened to quit, and on July 15, Ed Rollins resigned after Perot fired advertisement specialist Hal Riney, who worked with Rollins on the Reagan campaign. Rollins later claimed that a member of the campaign accused him of being a Bush plant with ties to the CIA. Amidst the chaos, Perot's support fell to 20%. The next day, Perot announced on Larry King Live that he would not seek the presidency. He explained {{that he did not want}} the House of Representatives to decide the election if the result caused the electoral college to be split. He asked his supporters to look for other candidates to nominate for the race, and formed <b>United</b> <b>We</b> <b>Stand</b> to [...] "influence the debate." [...] At this point, Perot had spent $12 million of his own money on the race. Bill Hillsman, who produced a few unaired advertisements for the campaign, wrote that Perot's withdrawal was a tactic to find temporary relief from the press.|$|E

2500|$|What {{followed}} was Morte accidentale di un anarchico (Accidental Death of an Anarchist), Fo's most internationally recognised play, {{described by the}} playwright as [...] "a grotesque farce about a tragic farce". It opened in December 1970, Fo having written it after right-wing extremists and the Italian Secret Service carried out a [...] "terrorist" [...] attack on the Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura in Piazza Fontana in Milan in 1969. [...] (See: Strategy of tension.) This farce subsequently toured Italy with Tutti uniti! Tutti insieme! Ma scusa, quello non è il padrone? (<b>United</b> <b>We</b> <b>Stand!</b> All Together Now! Oops, Isn't That the Boss?), considered by Rame to be Fo's best work apart from Morte accidentale and Mistero buffo.

Fedayn, first performed in January 1972, it consists of a series of autobiographical accounts from Palestine.|$|E

2500|$|The group came {{together}} in 1969 and began recording some songs with Hiller. Their first single [...] "Love One Another" [...] failed to chart, but the follow-up [...] "United We Stand" [...] (released in January 1970) was a worldwide hit. [...] "United We Stand" [...] was heavily played on British radio, and broke the American market. The single became a Top 20 hit in the UK, Canada, and US. The song has since been used as the closing theme for television's Brady Bunch Hour and as an anthem for various causes. Burrows left the group soon after and as a four-piece, The Brotherhood of Man followed [...] "United We Stand" [...] with another hit, [...] "Where Are You Going to My Love". The song charted in the UK, Canada, and US and has since been covered by Olivia Newton-John and The Osmonds among others. A début album <b>United</b> <b>We</b> <b>Stand</b> followed soon after.|$|E
2500|$|British {{political}} writer George Monbiot decried Sierra's treatment, citing it as {{an example}} of state persecution and the erosion of civil liberties in the United States, while journalist Amy Goodman characterized it as evidence of [...] "a new McCarthyism". Charles C Haynes, senior scholar at the First Amendment Center, also situated the controversy {{in the context of the}} freedom of expression debate, criticising the school for allowing a [...] "heckler's veto" [...] to censor Sierra and the school district for spending [...] "more than US$75,000 fighting to keep her quiet". A New York University drama project investigating post-9/11 America composed a theater piece, <b>United</b> <b>We</b> <b>Stand,</b> inspired by Sierra's actions. The Thomas Jefferson Center, an organization dedicated to the protection of freedom of expression, highlighted the controversy in 2002 and awarded the Kanawha school board and principal Forest Mann with their annual [...] "Jefferson Muzzle" [...] award. Highlighting a quote by Katie Sierra ("There are many types of anarchy. I want us to unite as one instead of having some government over top of us.") the center wrote, [...] "While school officials have the authority to prevent disruption of school activities, such authority should not be used as a pretext to stifle expression with which they disagree. Moreover, a high school student who shows an active interest in the important issues of the day and who takes the initiative to form a club to pursue that interest should be commended." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "The Liberty Song", {{written by}} Founding Father John Dickinson in 1768 {{to the music}} of William Boyce's [...] "Heart of Oak", is perhaps the first {{patriotic}} song written in America. The song contains the line [...] "by <b>uniting</b> <b>we</b> <b>stand,</b> by dividing <b>we</b> fall", which was an overture to the feelings of common blood and origin the Americans had whilst fighting the French and Indian War, and is also the first recorded use of the sentiment. Additionally, other songs gained prominence in keeping with British and American unity namely [...] "The British Grenadiers," [...] and [...] "God Save the King". However, with the War of Independence the tunes of the last two were combined with new words while [...] "Yankee Doodle", long a tune and lyric addressed to the unique American population descended from the British became widely popular. Political and cultural links between the colony and Great Britain can perhaps explain the ongoing popularity of the two former tunes, despite the war for independence.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{talks about}} how Updike Underhill, the protagonist-narrator of Royall Tyler’s novel ‘The Algerine Captive’, seeks a full {{understanding}} of his own country by removing the beloved object of his analysis from himself. Through a long journey that takes him elsewhere, he grasps the rich complexity of reality and finally comes to accept the totality of his country in its positive and negative aspects. Thus Royall Tyler indicates expatriation and the comparison with the elsewhere as appropriate means to know the United States better. This nationalist feeling is the underlying key-note of the whole book and one of its main themes. Explicitly or implicitly Tyler speaks of America even if he is describing British or Algerian realities and his narration sometimes wavers between praising and criticizing his native land. With the last sentence of the book, “By <b>uniting</b> <b>we</b> <b>stand,</b> by dividing <b>we</b> fall”, Tyler underlines the necessity for a voluntaristic rather than naturalistic nationalism for the United States and gives his main contribution to the developing American thought and fiction writing...|$|R
2500|$|Prior to the book's publication, {{during the}} U.S. midterm {{election}} campaign {{period in the}} third week of October 2006, several prominent Democrats criticized both the book and the author, a fellow Democrat. Specifically, Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean issued a statement: [...] "While I have tremendous respect for former President Carter, I fundamentally disagree and do not support his analysis of Israel and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. On this issue President Carter speaks for himself, the opinions in his book are his own, they are not the views or position of the Democratic Party. I and other Democrats will continue to stand with Israel in its battle against terrorism and for a lasting peace with its neighbors." [...] Then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi stated: With all due respect to former President Carter, he does not speak for the Democratic Party on Israel. Democrats have been steadfast in their support of Israel from its birth, in part because we recognize that to do so is in the national security interests of the <b>United</b> States. <b>We</b> <b>stand</b> with Israel now and <b>we</b> <b>stand</b> with Israel forever.|$|R
